"Current datetime is 2024-05-22 22:51:17.844667. Your role is an experienced data analyst, and your task is to create a business analytics report in the form of a data storytelling plan. This plan should include the following components:

Objectives: Clearly define the goals of your analysis.
Storytelling Flow: Choose the most appropriate flow from the given choices: ['Hierarchical Flow', 'Comparative Flow', 'Problem-Solution Flow', 'Cause-and-Effect Flow', 'Exploratory Flow', 'Linear Flow'].
Audiences: Identify the specific audience for this analysis.
Narrative Flow: Specify a minimum of six relevant metrics and dimensions in the narrative flow from the provided database schema to support your narrative. Construct a logical and coherent narrative flow in paragraph form, ensuring it covers all important aspects.
Assumptions: Identify and list down a minimum of two cause-and-effect assumptions that involve relationships between variables in the database schema.
Scope: Define the boundaries and limitations of your analysis.
Context: Provide context by mentioning the industry and department to which this data story applies.
Possible Insights: List potential insights that could be derived from the analysis.
Possible Outcomes: Outline the potential outcomes or implications based on the insights.

NEVER USE numbering inside the narrative flow.
Ensure that your plan is structured as a JSON dictionary object, with each component corresponding to a key, and your content provided as the associated values.

For more context, you are provided a database schema to support your narrative flow.

Database Schema:
CREATE TABLE ""starhub_data_asset.data_asset_001_variance"" (
    `CostVariance_Actual_vs_Budget` int,
    `RevenueVariance_Actual_vs_Forecast` int,
    `CostVariance_Actual_vs_Forecast` int,
    `Product` text,
    `Date` text
);

/* Given the following database description: */
 This fact table stores variance data related to an organization's financial performance. It captures revenue and cost variances between actual and forecasted values, as well as actual and budgeted costs for each product on a specific date. By providing detailed insights into financial discrepancies, this table supports informed decision-making, performance tracking, and budget monitoring.

/* Given the following database column description: */
CostVariance_Actual_vs_Budget: Cost Variance: Actual vs Budget shows the difference between the actual and budgeted costs for a product on a specific date.
RevenueVariance_Actual_vs_Forecast: Revenue Variance: Actual vs Forecast shows the difference between the actual and forecasted revenues for a product on a specific date.
CostVariance_Actual_vs_Forecast: Cost Variance: Actual vs Forecast shows the difference between the actual and forecasted costs for a product on a specific date.
Product: Product is the specific product or item for which the cost and revenue variances are being measured.
Date: Date refers to the date for which the cost and revenue variances are reported.


/* Given the following database column sample: */
CostVariance_Actual_vs_Budget: -6498
RevenueVariance_Actual_vs_Forecast: -83171
CostVariance_Actual_vs_Forecast: -3331
Product: BroadBand
Date: 01/01/2022


Always use the database columns below in the data story telling plan.

","Generate a data storytelling plan based on the user intent below.

User intent: Analyze cost variances (actual vs. budget) for all products on a quarterly basis to track budget adherence.

Provide your response ONLY in a VALID JSON format given. NEVER ADD ANY EXPLANATIONS or NOTES. ENSURE that the response is COMPLETE and NEVER ENDS abruptly.
