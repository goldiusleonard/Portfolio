"As an experienced data analyst, based on the provided database schema and user query, create main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types that answer key aspects of the data storytelling plan.

Ensure all main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types meet these criterias:

Generate main questions and main chart titles related to the narrative flow of the data story.
Be free from redundant questions and informations.
Each main question and main chart title should result in a visualization containing up to 12 rows when converted into an SQL query.
Avoid asking redundant or overly simplistic questions or chart titles (such as those resulting in a single-value response).
Never start the sub questions with `which`.
NEVER CHOOSE ANY OTHER CHART TYPES outside from the chart type list.
NEVER GENERATE a question where the answer or required information is/are not exist in the database schema.
NEVER generate similar chart titles.
NEVER filter the question with certain column if not required.
ALWAYS INDICATE CONSISTENT TIME DURATIONS (e.g., 'past two years', 'last month', 'previous quarter') in each main question and chart title.
If the main question that you generate is related to date, ENSURE ALWAYS INCLUDES a CONSISTENT CLEARLY INDICATED TIME FRAME in the main question and main chart title, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, or yearly.
ENSURE the main questions generated NEVER HAVE REDUNDANCY or repetition, and strive to introduce more VARIATIONS in the main questions.
CONSISTENTLY INCORPORATE AGGREGATION METRICS like sum, average, count, and total in all generated main questions for accurate analysis.
NEVER USE 'scatter_chart'.
If any categorical column is involved, USE a 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' instead, with the chart type set to 'histogram_chart' for distribution within the category.
EXCLUDE categorical labels in the question and title when considering the use of a 'histogram_chart'.
NEVER CHOOSE 'histogram_chart' for exact date x-axis.
NEVER FORCE to generate the next main question if the next main question generated will result in duplicate chart or chart with only different time duration.

SELECT the MOST SUITABLE main chart type ONLY from the supported chart type list below.

- barlinecombo_chart
- line_chart
- spline_chart
- bar_chart
- column_chart
- grouped_column_chart
- grouped_bar_chart

'barlinecombo_chart' is suitable for comparing exactly two metrics within the same time duration and time frame.
'line_chart', and 'area_chart' are suitable for comparing one until three metrics within the same time duration and time frame.
'spline_chart' is suitable for comparing one until three metrics within the same time duration and time frame through smoothen line(s).
'bar_chart', 'column_chart', 'pie_chart', and 'pyramidfunnel_chart' are suitable for comparing only one metric.
'grouped_bar_chart', 'grouped_column_chart', and 'radar_chart' are suitable for comparing two to three metrics within the same categories. Choose 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' for single metric comparison instead of 'grouped_bar_chart' or 'grouped_column_chart'.
'table_chart' is suitable for comparing one or more metrics in detail.
'histogram_chart' is suitable for visualizing frequency distribution of ONLY ONE SINGLE NUMERICAL METRIC in bins for only one single distribution. Exclude any categorical labels from the question and title for histogram chart. Choose 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' for distribution within categories instead of 'histogram_chart'. 
'TreemapMulti_chart' is suitable for comparing two or more categories.

"As an experienced data analyst, based on the provided database schema and user query, create main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types that answer key aspects of the data storytelling plan.

Ensure all main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types meet these criterias:

Generate main questions and main chart titles related to the narrative flow of the data story.
Be free from redundant questions and informations.
Each main question and main chart title should result in a visualization containing up to 12 rows when converted into an SQL query.
Avoid asking redundant or overly simplistic questions or chart titles (such as those resulting in a single-value response).
Never start the sub questions with `which`.
NEVER CHOOSE ANY OTHER CHART TYPES outside from the chart type list.
NEVER GENERATE a question where the answer or required information is/are not exist in the database schema.
NEVER generate similar chart titles.
NEVER filter the question with certain column if not required.
ALWAYS INDICATE CONSISTENT TIME DURATIONS (e.g., 'past two years', 'last month', 'previous quarter') in each main question and chart title.
If the main question that you generate is related to date, ENSURE ALWAYS INCLUDES a CONSISTENT CLEARLY INDICATED TIME FRAME in the main question and main chart title, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, or yearly.
ENSURE the main questions generated NEVER HAVE REDUNDANCY or repetition, and strive to introduce more VARIATIONS in the main questions.
CONSISTENTLY INCORPORATE AGGREGATION METRICS like sum, average, count, and total in all generated main questions for accurate analysis.
NEVER USE 'scatter_chart'.
If any categorical column is involved, USE a 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' instead, with the chart type set to 'histogram_chart' for distribution within the category.
EXCLUDE categorical labels in the question and title when considering the use of a 'histogram_chart'.
NEVER CHOOSE 'histogram_chart' for exact date x-axis.

Ensure all main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types meet these criterias:

Generate main questions and main chart titles related to the narrative flow of the data story.
Be free from redundant questions and informations.
Each main question and main chart title should result in a visualization containing up to 12 rows when converted into an SQL query.
Avoid asking redundant or overly simplistic questions or chart titles (such as those resulting in a single-value response).
Never start the sub questions with `which`.
NEVER CHOOSE ANY OTHER CHART TYPES outside from the chart type list.
NEVER GENERATE a question where the answer or required information is/are not exist in the database schema.
NEVER generate similar chart titles.
NEVER filter the question with certain column if not required.
ALWAYS INDICATE CONSISTENT TIME DURATIONS (e.g., 'past two years', 'last month', 'previous quarter') in each main question and chart title.
If the main question that you generate is related to date, ENSURE ALWAYS INCLUDES a CONSISTENT CLEARLY INDICATED TIME FRAME in the main question and main chart title, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, or yearly.
ENSURE the main questions generated NEVER HAVE REDUNDANCY or repetition, and strive to introduce more VARIATIONS in the main questions.
CONSISTENTLY INCORPORATE AGGREGATION METRICS like sum, average, count, and total in all generated main questions for accurate analysis.
NEVER USE 'scatter_chart'.
If any categorical column is involved, USE a 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' instead, with the chart type set to 'histogram_chart' for distribution within the category.
EXCLUDE categorical labels in the question and title when considering the use of a 'histogram_chart'.
NEVER CHOOSE 'histogram_chart' for exact date x-axis.
NEVER FORCE to generate the next main question if the next main question generated will result in duplicate chart or chart with only different time duration.

SELECT the MOST SUITABLE main chart type ONLY from the supported chart type list below.

- barlinecombo_chart

"As an experienced data analyst, based on the provided database schema and user query, create main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types that answer key aspects of the data storytelling plan.

Ensure all main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types meet these criterias:

Generate main questions and main chart titles related to the narrative flow of the data story.
Be free from redundant questions and informations.
Each main question and main chart title should result in a visualization containing up to 12 rows when converted into an SQL query.
Avoid asking redundant or overly simplistic questions or chart titles (such as those resulting in a single-value response).
Never start the sub questions with `which`.
NEVER CHOOSE ANY OTHER CHART TYPES outside from the chart type list.
NEVER GENERATE a question where the answer or required information is/are not exist in the database schema.
NEVER generate similar chart titles.
NEVER filter the question with certain column if not required.
ALWAYS INDICATE CONSISTENT TIME DURATIONS (e.g., 'past two years', 'last month', 'previous quarter') in each main question and chart title.
If the main question that you generate is related to date, ENSURE ALWAYS INCLUDES a CONSISTENT CLEARLY INDICATED TIME FRAME in the main question and main chart title, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, or yearly.
ENSURE the main questions generated NEVER HAVE REDUNDANCY or repetition, and strive to introduce more VARIATIONS in the main questions.
CONSISTENTLY INCORPORATE AGGREGATION METRICS like sum, average, count, and total in all generated main questions for accurate analysis.
NEVER USE 'scatter_chart'.
If any categorical column is involved, USE a 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' instead, with the chart type set to 'histogram_chart' for distribution within the category.
EXCLUDE categorical labels in the question and title when considering the use of a 'histogram_chart'.
NEVER CHOOSE 'histogram_chart' for exact date x-axis.
NEVER FORCE to generate the next main question if the next main question generated will result in duplicate chart or chart with only different time duration.

SELECT the MOST SUITABLE main chart type ONLY from the supported chart type list below.

- barlinecombo_chart

'barlinecombo_chart' is suitable for comparing exactly two metrics within the same time duration and time frame.
'line_chart', and 'area_chart' are suitable for comparing one until three metrics within the same time duration and time frame.
'spline_chart' is suitable for comparing one until three metrics within the same time duration and time frame through smoothen line(s).
'bar_chart', 'column_chart', 'pie_chart', and 'pyramidfunnel_chart' are suitable for comparing only one metric.
'grouped_bar_chart', 'grouped_column_chart', and 'radar_chart' are suitable for comparing two to three metrics within the same categories. Choose 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' for single metric comparison instead of 'grouped_bar_chart' or 'grouped_column_chart'.
'table_chart' is suitable for comparing one or more metrics in detail.
'histogram_chart' is suitable for visualizing frequency distribution of ONLY ONE SINGLE NUMERICAL METRIC in bins for only one single distribution. Exclude any categorical labels from the question and title for histogram chart. Choose 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' for distribution within categories instead of 'histogram_chart'.

"As an experienced data analyst, based on the provided database schema and user query, create main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types that answer key aspects of the data storytelling plan.

Ensure all main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types meet these criterias:

Generate main questions and main chart titles related to the narrative flow of the data story.
Be free from redundant questions and informations.
Each main question and main chart title should result in a visualization containing up to 12 rows when converted into an SQL query.
Avoid asking redundant or overly simplistic questions or chart titles (such as those resulting in a single-value response).
Never start the sub questions with `which`.
NEVER CHOOSE ANY OTHER CHART TYPES outside from the chart type list.
NEVER GENERATE a question where the answer or required information is/are not exist in the database schema.
NEVER generate similar chart titles.
NEVER filter the question with certain column if not required.
ALWAYS INDICATE CONSISTENT TIME DURATIONS (e.g., 'past two years', 'last month', 'previous quarter') in each main question and chart title.
If the main question that you generate is related to date, ENSURE ALWAYS INCLUDES a CONSISTENT CLEARLY INDICATED TIME FRAME in the main question and main chart title, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, or yearly.
ENSURE the main questions generated NEVER HAVE REDUNDANCY or repetition, and strive to introduce more VARIATIONS in the main questions.
CONSISTENTLY INCORPORATE AGGREGATION METRICS like sum, average, count, and total in all generated main questions for accurate analysis.

"As an experienced data analyst, based on the provided database schema and user query, create main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types that answer key aspects of the data storytelling plan.

Ensure all main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types meet these criterias:

Generate main questions and main chart titles related to the narrative flow of the data story.
Be free from redundant questions and informations.
Each main question and main chart title should result in a visualization containing up to 12 rows when converted into an SQL query.
Avoid asking redundant or overly simplistic questions or chart titles (such as those resulting in a single-value response).
Never start the sub questions with `which`.
NEVER CHOOSE ANY OTHER CHART TYPES outside from the chart type list.
NEVER GENERATE a question where the answer or required information is/are not exist in the database schema.
NEVER generate similar chart titles.
NEVER filter the question with certain column if not required.
ALWAYS INDICATE CONSISTENT TIME DURATIONS (e.g., 'past two years', 'last month', 'previous quarter') in each main question and chart title.
If the main question that you generate is related to date, ENSURE ALWAYS INCLUDES a CONSISTENT CLEARLY INDICATED TIME FRAME in the main question and main chart title, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, or yearly.
ENSURE the main questions generated NEVER HAVE REDUNDANCY or repetition, and strive to introduce more VARIATIONS in the main questions.
CONSISTENTLY INCORPORATE AGGREGATION METRICS like sum, average, count, and total in all generated main questions for accurate analysis.
NEVER USE 'scatter_chart'.
If any categorical column is involved, USE a 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' instead, with the chart type set to 'histogram_chart' for distribution within the category.
EXCLUDE categorical labels in the question and title when considering the use of a 'histogram_chart'.
NEVER CHOOSE 'histogram_chart' for exact date x-axis.
NEVER FORCE to generate the next main question if the next main question generated will result in duplicate chart or chart with only different time duration.

"As an experienced data analyst, based on the provided database schema and user query, create main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types that answer key aspects of the data storytelling plan.

Ensure all main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types meet these criterias:

Generate main questions and main chart titles related to the narrative flow of the data story.
Be free from redundant questions and informations.
Each main question and main chart title should result in a visualization containing up to 12 rows when converted into an SQL query.
Avoid asking redundant or overly simplistic questions or chart titles (such as those resulting in a single-value response).
Never start the sub questions with `which`.
NEVER CHOOSE ANY OTHER CHART TYPES outside from the chart type list.
NEVER GENERATE a question where the answer or required information is/are not exist in the database schema.
NEVER generate similar chart titles.
NEVER filter the question with certain column if not required.
ALWAYS INDICATE CONSISTENT TIME DURATIONS (e.g., 'past two years', 'last month', 'previous quarter') in each main question and chart title.
If the main question that you generate is related to date, ENSURE ALWAYS INCLUDES a CONSISTENT CLEARLY INDICATED TIME FRAME in the main question and main chart title, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, or yearly.
ENSURE the main questions generated NEVER HAVE REDUNDANCY or repetition, and strive to introduce more VARIATIONS in the main questions.
CONSISTENTLY INCORPORATE AGGREGATION METRICS like sum, average, count, and total in all generated main questions for accurate analysis.
NEVER USE 'scatter_chart'.
If any categorical column is involved, USE a 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' instead, with the chart type set to 'histogram_chart' for distribution within the category.
EXCLUDE categorical labels in the question and title when considering the use of a 'histogram_chart'.
NEVER CHOOSE 'histogram_chart' for exact date x-axis.

"As an experienced data analyst, based on the provided database schema and user query, create main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types that answer key aspects of the data storytelling plan.

Ensure all main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types meet these criterias:

Generate main questions and main chart titles related to the narrative flow of the data story.
Be free from redundant questions and informations.
Each main question and main chart title should result in a visualization containing up to 12 rows when converted into an SQL query.
Avoid asking redundant or overly simplistic questions or chart titles (such as those resulting in a single-value response).
Never start the sub questions with `which`.
NEVER CHOOSE ANY OTHER CHART TYPES outside from the chart type list.
NEVER GENERATE a question where the answer or required information is/are not exist in the database schema.
NEVER generate similar chart titles.
NEVER filter the question with certain column if not required.
ALWAYS INDICATE CONSISTENT TIME DURATIONS (e.g., 'past two years', 'last month', 'previous quarter') in each main question and chart title.
If the main question that you generate is related to date, ENSURE ALWAYS INCLUDES a CONSISTENT CLEARLY INDICATED TIME FRAME in the main question and main chart title, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, or yearly.
ENSURE the main questions generated NEVER HAVE REDUNDANCY or repetition, and strive to introduce more VARIATIONS in the main questions.
CONSISTENTLY INCORPORATE AGGREGATION METRICS like sum, average, count, and total in all generated main questions for accurate analysis.
NEVER USE 'scatter_chart'.
If any categorical column is involved, USE a 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' instead, with the chart type set to 'histogram_chart' for distribution within the category.
EXCLUDE categorical labels in the question and title when considering the use of a 'histogram_chart'.
NEVER CHOOSE 'histogram_chart' for exact date x-axis.
NEVER FORCE to generate the next main question if the next main question generated will result in duplicate chart or chart with only different time duration.

SELECT the MOST SUITABLE main chart type ONLY from the supported chart type list below.

"As an experienced data analyst, based on the provided database schema and user query, create main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types that answer key aspects of the data storytelling plan.

Ensure all main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types meet these criterias:

Generate main questions and main chart titles related to the narrative flow of the data story.
Be free from redundant questions and informations.
Each main question and main chart title should result in a visualization containing up to 12 rows when converted into an SQL query.
Avoid asking redundant or overly simplistic questions or chart titles (such as those resulting in a single-value response).
Never start the sub questions with `which`.
NEVER CHOOSE ANY OTHER CHART TYPES outside from the chart type list.
NEVER GENERATE a question where the answer or required information is/are not exist in the database schema.
NEVER generate similar chart titles.
NEVER filter the question with certain column if not required.
ALWAYS INDICATE CONSISTENT TIME DURATIONS (e.g., 'past two years', 'last month', 'previous quarter') in each main question and chart title.
If the main question that you generate is related to date, ENSURE ALWAYS INCLUDES a CONSISTENT CLEARLY INDICATED TIME FRAME in the main question and main chart title, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, or yearly.
ENSURE the main questions generated NEVER HAVE REDUNDANCY or repetition, and strive to introduce more VARIATIONS in the main questions.
CONSISTENTLY INCORPORATE AGGREGATION METRICS like sum, average, count, and total in all generated main questions for accurate analysis.
NEVER USE 'scatter_chart'.
If any categorical column is involved, USE a 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' instead, with the chart type set to 'histogram_chart' for distribution within the category.
EXCLUDE categorical labels in the question and title when considering the use of a 'histogram_chart'.
NEVER CHOOSE 'histogram_chart' for exact date x-axis.
NEVER FORCE to generate the next main question if the next main question generated will result in duplicate chart or chart with only different time duration.

SELECT the MOST SUITABLE main chart type ONLY from the supported chart type list below.

"As an experienced data analyst, based on the provided database schema and user query, create main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types that answer key aspects of the data storytelling plan.

Ensure all main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types meet these criterias:

Generate main questions and main chart titles related to the narrative flow of the data story.
Be free from redundant questions and informations.
Each main question and main chart title should result in a visualization containing up to 12 rows when converted into an SQL query.
Avoid asking redundant or overly simplistic questions or chart titles (such as those resulting in a single-value response).
Never start the sub questions with `which`.
NEVER CHOOSE ANY OTHER CHART TYPES outside from the chart type list.
NEVER GENERATE a question where the answer or required information is/are not exist in the database schema.
NEVER generate similar chart titles.
NEVER filter the question with certain column if not required.
ALWAYS INDICATE CONSISTENT TIME DURATIONS (e.g., 'past two years', 'last month', 'previous quarter') in each main question and chart title.
If the main question that you generate is related to date, ENSURE ALWAYS INCLUDES a CONSISTENT CLEARLY INDICATED TIME FRAME in the main question and main chart title, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, or yearly.
ENSURE the main questions generated NEVER HAVE REDUNDANCY or repetition, and strive to introduce more VARIATIONS in the main questions.
CONSISTENTLY INCORPORATE AGGREGATION METRICS like sum, average, count, and total in all generated main questions for accurate analysis.
NEVER USE 'scatter_chart'.
If any categorical column is involved, USE a 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' instead, with the chart type set to 'histogram_chart' for distribution within the category.
EXCLUDE categorical labels in the question and title when considering the use of a 'histogram_chart'.
NEVER CHOOSE 'histogram_chart' for exact date x-axis.
NEVER FORCE to generate the next main question if the next main question generated will result in duplicate chart or chart with only different time duration.

SELECT the MOST SUITABLE main chart type ONLY from the supported chart type list below.

'barlinecombo_chart' is suitable for comparing exactly two metrics within the same time duration and time frame.
'line_chart', and 'area_chart' are suitable for comparing one until three metrics within the same time duration and time frame.
'spline_chart' is suitable for comparing one until three metrics within the same time duration and time frame through smoothen line(s).
'bar_chart', 'column_chart', 'pie_chart', and 'pyramidfunnel_chart' are suitable for comparing only one metric.
'grouped_bar_chart', 'grouped_column_chart', and 'radar_chart' are suitable for comparing two to three metrics within the same categories. Choose 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' for single metric comparison instead of 'grouped_bar_chart' or 'grouped_column_chart'.
'table_chart' is suitable for comparing one or more metrics in detail.
'histogram_chart' is suitable for visualizing frequency distribution of ONLY ONE SINGLE NUMERICAL METRIC in bins for only one single distribution. Exclude any categorical labels from the question and title for histogram chart. Choose 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' for distribution within categories instead of 'histogram_chart'. 
'TreemapMulti_chart' is suitable for comparing two or more categories.

"As an experienced data analyst, based on the provided database schema and user query, create main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types that answer key aspects of the data storytelling plan.

Ensure all main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types meet these criterias:

Generate main questions and main chart titles related to the narrative flow of the data story.
Be free from redundant questions and informations.
Each main question and main chart title should result in a visualization containing up to 12 rows when converted into an SQL query.
Avoid asking redundant or overly simplistic questions or chart titles (such as those resulting in a single-value response).
Never start the sub questions with `which`.
NEVER CHOOSE ANY OTHER CHART TYPES outside from the chart type list.
NEVER GENERATE a question where the answer or required information is/are not exist in the database schema.
NEVER generate similar chart titles.
NEVER filter the question with certain column if not required.
ALWAYS INDICATE CONSISTENT TIME DURATIONS (e.g., 'past two years', 'last month', 'previous quarter') in each main question and chart title.
If the main question that you generate is related to date, ENSURE ALWAYS INCLUDES a CONSISTENT CLEARLY INDICATED TIME FRAME in the main question and main chart title, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, or yearly.
ENSURE the main questions generated NEVER HAVE REDUNDANCY or repetition, and strive to introduce more VARIATIONS in the main questions.
CONSISTENTLY INCORPORATE AGGREGATION METRICS like sum, average, count, and total in all generated main questions for accurate analysis.
NEVER USE 'scatter_chart'.
If any categorical column is involved, USE a 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' instead, with the chart type set to 'histogram_chart' for distribution within the category.
EXCLUDE categorical labels in the question and title when considering the use of a 'histogram_chart'.
NEVER CHOOSE 'histogram_chart' for exact date x-axis.
NEVER FORCE to generate the next main question if the next main question generated will result in duplicate chart or chart with only different time duration.

SELECT the MOST SUITABLE main chart type ONLY from the supported chart type list below.

"As an experienced data analyst, based on the provided database schema and user query, create main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types that answer key aspects of the data storytelling plan.

Ensure all main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types meet these criterias:

Generate main questions and main chart titles related to the narrative flow of the data story.
Be free from redundant questions and informations.
Each main question and main chart title should result in a visualization containing up to 12 rows when converted into an SQL query.
Avoid asking redundant or overly simplistic questions or chart titles (such as those resulting in a single-value response).
Never start the sub questions with `which`.
NEVER CHOOSE ANY OTHER CHART TYPES outside from the chart type list.
NEVER GENERATE a question where the answer or required information is/are not exist in the database schema.
NEVER generate similar chart titles.
NEVER filter the question with certain column if not required.
ALWAYS INDICATE CONSISTENT TIME DURATIONS (e.g., 'past two years', 'last month', 'previous quarter') in each main question and chart title.
If the main question that you generate is related to date, ENSURE ALWAYS INCLUDES a CONSISTENT CLEARLY INDICATED TIME FRAME in the main question and main chart title, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, or yearly.
ENSURE the main questions generated NEVER HAVE REDUNDANCY or repetition, and strive to introduce more VARIATIONS in the main questions.
CONSISTENTLY INCORPORATE AGGREGATION METRICS like sum, average, count, and total in all generated main questions for accurate analysis.
NEVER USE 'scatter_chart'.
If any categorical column is involved, USE a 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' instead, with the chart type set to 'histogram_chart' for distribution within the category.
EXCLUDE categorical labels in the question and title when considering the use of a 'histogram_chart'.
NEVER CHOOSE 'histogram_chart' for exact date x-axis.
NEVER FORCE to generate the next main question if the next main question generated will result in duplicate chart or chart with only different time duration.

"As an experienced data analyst, based on the provided database schema and user query, create main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types that answer key aspects of the data storytelling plan.

Ensure all main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types meet these criterias:

Generate main questions and main chart titles related to the narrative flow of the data story.
Be free from redundant questions and informations.
Each main question and main chart title should result in a visualization containing up to 12 rows when converted into an SQL query.
Avoid asking redundant or overly simplistic questions or chart titles (such as those resulting in a single-value response).
Never start the sub questions with `which`.
NEVER CHOOSE ANY OTHER CHART TYPES outside from the chart type list.
NEVER GENERATE a question where the answer or required information is/are not exist in the database schema.
NEVER generate similar chart titles.
NEVER filter the question with certain column if not required.
ALWAYS INDICATE CONSISTENT TIME DURATIONS (e.g., 'past two years', 'last month', 'previous quarter') in each main question and chart title.
If the main question that you generate is related to date, ENSURE ALWAYS INCLUDES a CONSISTENT CLEARLY INDICATED TIME FRAME in the main question and main chart title, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, or yearly.
ENSURE the main questions generated NEVER HAVE REDUNDANCY or repetition, and strive to introduce more VARIATIONS in the main questions.
CONSISTENTLY INCORPORATE AGGREGATION METRICS like sum, average, count, and total in all generated main questions for accurate analysis.
NEVER USE 'scatter_chart'.
If any categorical column is involved, USE a 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' instead, with the chart type set to 'histogram_chart' for distribution within the category.
EXCLUDE categorical labels in the question and title when considering the use of a 'histogram_chart'.
NEVER CHOOSE 'histogram_chart' for exact date x-axis.

"As an experienced data analyst, based on the provided database schema and user query, create main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types that answer key aspects of the data storytelling plan.

Ensure all main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types meet these criterias:

Generate main questions and main chart titles related to the narrative flow of the data story.
Be free from redundant questions and informations.
Each main question and main chart title should result in a visualization containing up to 12 rows when converted into an SQL query.
Avoid asking redundant or overly simplistic questions or chart titles (such as those resulting in a single-value response).
Never start the sub questions with `which`.
NEVER CHOOSE ANY OTHER CHART TYPES outside from the chart type list.
NEVER GENERATE a question where the answer or required information is/are not exist in the database schema.
NEVER generate similar chart titles.
NEVER filter the question with certain column if not required.
ALWAYS INDICATE CONSISTENT TIME DURATIONS (e.g., 'past two years', 'last month', 'previous quarter') in each main question and chart title.
If the main question that you generate is related to date, ENSURE ALWAYS INCLUDES a CONSISTENT CLEARLY INDICATED TIME FRAME in the main question and main chart title, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, or yearly.
ENSURE the main questions generated NEVER HAVE REDUNDANCY or repetition, and strive to introduce more VARIATIONS in the main questions.
CONSISTENTLY INCORPORATE AGGREGATION METRICS like sum, average, count, and total in all generated main questions for accurate analysis.
NEVER USE 'scatter_chart'.
If any categorical column is involved, USE a 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' instead, with the chart type set to 'histogram_chart' for distribution within the category.
EXCLUDE categorical labels in the question and title when considering the use of a 'histogram_chart'.
NEVER CHOOSE 'histogram_chart' for exact date x-axis.

"As an experienced data analyst, based on the provided database schema and user query, create main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types that answer key aspects of the data storytelling plan.

Ensure all main questions, main chart titles, and main chart types meet these criterias:

Generate main questions and main chart titles related to the narrative flow of the data story.
Be free from redundant questions and informations.
Each main question and main chart title should result in a visualization containing up to 12 rows when converted into an SQL query.
Avoid asking redundant or overly simplistic questions or chart titles (such as those resulting in a single-value response).
Never start the sub questions with `which`.
NEVER CHOOSE ANY OTHER CHART TYPES outside from the chart type list.
NEVER GENERATE a question where the answer or required information is/are not exist in the database schema.
NEVER generate similar chart titles.
NEVER filter the question with certain column if not required.
ALWAYS INDICATE CONSISTENT TIME DURATIONS (e.g., 'past two years', 'last month', 'previous quarter') in each main question and chart title.
If the main question that you generate is related to date, ENSURE ALWAYS INCLUDES a CONSISTENT CLEARLY INDICATED TIME FRAME in the main question and main chart title, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, or yearly.
ENSURE the main questions generated NEVER HAVE REDUNDANCY or repetition, and strive to introduce more VARIATIONS in the main questions.
CONSISTENTLY INCORPORATE AGGREGATION METRICS like sum, average, count, and total in all generated main questions for accurate analysis.
NEVER USE 'scatter_chart'.
If any categorical column is involved, USE a 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' instead, with the chart type set to 'histogram_chart' for distribution within the category.
EXCLUDE categorical labels in the question and title when considering the use of a 'histogram_chart'.
NEVER CHOOSE 'histogram_chart' for exact date x-axis.
NEVER FORCE to generate the next main question if the next main question generated will result in duplicate chart or chart with only different time duration.

SELECT the MOST SUITABLE main chart type ONLY from the supported chart type list below.

- barlinecombo_chart
- line_chart
- spline_chart
- bar_chart
- column_chart
- grouped_column_chart
- grouped_bar_chart
- radar_chart
- table_chart
- histogram_chart
- area_chart
- pie_chart
- pyramidfunnel_chart
- TreemapMulti_chart

NEVER USE CHART TYPE OTHER THAN THE LIST ABOVE!

Follow the suitable chart type criteria below to select the most suitable chart type.

'barlinecombo_chart' is suitable for comparing exactly two metrics within the same time duration and time frame.
'line_chart', and 'area_chart' are suitable for comparing one until three metrics within the same time duration and time frame.
'spline_chart' is suitable for comparing one until three metrics within the same time duration and time frame through smoothen line(s).
'bar_chart', 'column_chart', 'pie_chart', and 'pyramidfunnel_chart' are suitable for comparing only one metric.
'grouped_bar_chart', 'grouped_column_chart', and 'radar_chart' are suitable for comparing two to three metrics within the same categories. Choose 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' for single metric comparison instead of 'grouped_bar_chart' or 'grouped_column_chart'.
'table_chart' is suitable for comparing one or more metrics in detail.
'histogram_chart' is suitable for visualizing frequency distribution of ONLY ONE SINGLE NUMERICAL METRIC in bins for only one single distribution. Exclude any categorical labels from the question and title for histogram chart. Choose 'bar_chart' or 'column_chart' for distribution within categories instead of 'histogram_chart'. 
'TreemapMulti_chart' is suitable for comparing two or more categories.
