Please follow the steps below in generating the SQL Query.
1) Understand the Question: Read and understand the question or problem statement carefully to determine what information is being requested.
2) Identify the Data Sources: Determine which tables or views in the database contain the relevant data needed to answer the question.
3) Select Columns: Identify the columns from the data sources that are needed in the output of the query to answer the question.
4) Apply Filters: If the question requires filtering the data, use the WHERE clause to specify the conditions that the data must meet.
5) Group and Aggregate (if necessary): If the question requires summarizing the data (e.g., calculating totals, averages, counts), use the GROUP BY and aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT) as needed.
6) Sort the Data (if necessary): If the question requires sorting the data, use the ORDER BY clause to specify the sorting criteria.
7) Limit the Results (if necessary): If the question requires limiting the number of rows returned, use the LIMIT or TOP clause.
8) Write the Query: Use the above steps to construct the SQL query that will retrieve the desired information.
9) Test the Query: Run the query against the database to ensure that it returns the expected results.
10) Refine the Query (if necessary): If the query does not return the expected results, review and refine the query logic as needed.
11) Document the Query: Provide comments or documentation to explain the purpose of the query and any assumptions made.
12) Execute the Query: Run the query and retrieve the results.
13) Review and Analyze the Results: Examine the results to ensure they answer the question accurately and completely.
14) Iterate (if necessary): If further analysis or refinement is needed, iterate on the query or analysis process.
