Effect caused partly by act and partly by omission
36. Wherever the causing of a certain effect, or an attempt to cause
that effect, by an act or by an omission, is an offence, it is to be
understood that the causing of that effect partly by an act and partly by
an omission is the same offence.
ILLUSTRATION
A intentionally causes Z’s death, partly by illegally omitting to give Z food,
and partly by beating Z. A has committed murder.Penal Code 43
Cooperation by doing one of several acts constituting an offence
37. When an offence is committed by means of several acts,
whoever intentionally cooperates in the commission of that offence by
doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other
person, commits that offence.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A and B agree to murder Z, by severally, and at different times, giving him
small doses of poison. A and B administer the poison, according to the
agreement with intent to murder Z. Z dies from the effects of the several
doses of poison so administered to him. Here A and B intentionally
cooperate in the commission of murder, and as each of them does an act by
which the death is caused, they are both guilty of the offence, though their
acts are separate.
(b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner,
alternately for six hours at a time. A and B, intending to cause Z’s death,
knowingly cooperate in causing that effect by illegally omitting, each during
the time of his attendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that
purpose. Z dies of hunger. Both A and B are guilty of the murder of Z.
(c) A, a jailor, has the charge of Z, a prisoner. A, intending to cause Z’s death,
illegally omits to supply Z with food in consequence of which Z is much
reduced in strength, but the starvation is not sufficient to cause his death. A
is dismissed from his office, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or
cooperation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that he
is likely thereby to cause Z’s death. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder;
but as A did not co-operate with B, A is guilty only of an attempt to commit
murder.
Several persons engaged in the commission of a criminal act, may
be guilty of different offences
38. Where several persons are engaged or concerned in the
commission of a criminal act, they may be guilty of different offences
by means of that act.44 Laws of Malaysia ACT 574
ILLUSTRATION
A attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing
of Z would be only culpable homicide not amounting to murder. B, having ill
will towards Z, and intending to kill him, and not having been subject to the
provocation, assists A in killing Z. Here, though A and B are both engaged in
causing Z’s death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of culpable
homicide.
“Voluntarily”
39. A person is said to cause an effect “voluntarily” when he causes
it by means whereby he intended to cause it, or by means which, at
time of employing those means, he knew or had reason to believe to be
likely to cause it.
ILLUSTRATION
A sets fire, by night, to an inhabited house in a large town, for the purpose
of facilitating a robbery, and thus causes the death of a person. Here A may not
have intended to cause death, and may even be sorry that death has been caused
by his act; yet, if he knew that he was likely to cause death, he has caused death
voluntarily.

ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A gives Z fifty strokes with a stick. Here A may have committed the offence
of voluntarily causing hurt to Z by the whole beating, and also by each of
the blows which make up the whole beating. If A were liable to punishment
for every blow, he might be imprisoned for fifty years, one for each blow.
But he is liable only to one punishment for the whole beating.

by reason of a mistake of fact and not by reason of a mistake of law, in
good faith believes himself to be, bound by law to do it.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A, a soldier, fires on a mob by the order of his superior officer, in conformity
with the commands of the law. A has committed no offence.
(b) A, an officer of a Court, being ordered by that Court to arrest Y, and, after
due enquiry, believing Z to be Y, arrests Z. A has committed no offence.50 Laws of Malaysia ACT 574
Act of Judge when acting judicially
77. Nothing is an offence which is done by a Judge when acting
judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or which in good faith
he believes to be, given to him by law.
Act done pursuant to the judgment or order of a Court
78. Nothing which is done in pursuance of, or which is warranted
by the judgment or order of a Court, if done while such judgment or
order remains in force, is an offence, notwithstanding the Court may

person doing the act in good faith believes that the Court had such
jurisdiction.
Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing
himself justified by law
79. Nothing is an offence which is done by any person who is
justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by reason
of a mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be justified by
law, in doing it.
ILLUSTRATION
A sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder. A, in the exercise, to the
best of his judgment exerted in good faith, of the power which the law gives to
all persons of apprehending murderers in the act, seizes Z, in order to bring Z
before the proper authorities. A has committed no offence, though it may turn
out that Z was acting in self-defence.
Accident in the doing of a lawful act
80. Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune,
and without any criminal intention or knowledge, in the doing of a
lawful act in a lawful manner, by lawful means, and with proper care
and caution.Penal Code 51
ILLUSTRATION
A is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing
by. Here, if there was no want of proper caution on the part of A, his act is
excusable and not an offence.
Act likely to cause harm but done without a criminal intent, and
to prevent other harm
81. Nothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with
the knowledge that it is likely to cause harm, if it be done without any
criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of
preventing or avoiding other harm to person or property.
Explanation—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be
prevented or avoided was of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse
the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that it was likely to cause harm.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence
on his part, finds himself in such a position that, before he can stop his
vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with 20 or 30 passengers on
board, unless he changes the course of his vessel; and that, by changing his
course, he must incur risk of running down a boat, C, with only two
passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his
course without any intention to run down the boat C, and in good faith for
the purposes of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is
not guilty of an offence, though he may run down the boat C, by doing an
act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter
of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him
in incurring the risk of running down the boat C.
(b) A in a great fire pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from
spreading. He does this with the intention, in good faith, of saving human
life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of
such a nature and so imminent as to excuse A’s act, A is not guilty of the
offence.

of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing
the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary
to law.
Intoxication when a defence
85. (1) Save as provided in this section and in section 86,
intoxication shall not constitute a defence to any criminal charge.
(2) Intoxication shall be a defence to any criminal charge if by reason
thereof the person charged at the time of the act or omission
complained of did not know that such act or omission was wrong or
did not know what he was doing and—
(a) the state of intoxication was caused without his consent by
the malicious or negligent act of another person; or
(b) the person charged was by reason of intoxication insane,
temporarily or otherwise, at the time of such act or
omission.
Effect of defence of intoxication when established
86. (1) Where the defence under subsection 85(2) is established,
then in a case falling under paragraph (a) thereof the accused person
shall be acquitted, and in a case falling under paragraph (b), thePenal Code 53
provisions of section 84 of this Code, sections 347 and 348 of the
Criminal Procedure Code [Act 593] shall apply.
(2) Intoxication shall be taken into account for the purpose of
determining whether the person charged had formed any intention,
specific or otherwise, in the absence of which he would not be guilty
of the offence.
(3) For the purpose of this and the preceding section “intoxication”
shall be deemed to include a state produced by narcotics or drugs.
Act not intended and not known to be likely to cause death or
grievous hurt, done by consent
87. Nothing, which is not intended to cause death or grievous hurt,
and which is not known by the doer to be likely to cause death or
grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause,
or be intended by the doer to cause, to any person above eighteen years
of age, who has given consent, whether express or implied, to suffer
that harm; or by reason of any harm which it may be known by the
doer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take
the risk of that harm.
ILLUSTRATION
A and Z agree to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement
implies the consent of each to suffer any harm which, in the course of such
fencing, may be caused without foul play; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z,
A commits no offence.
Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for
the benefit of a person
88. Nothing, which is not intended to cause death, is an offence by
reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to
cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for
whose benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent,
whether express or implied, to suffer that harm, or to take the risk of
that harm.54 Laws of Malaysia ACT 574
ILLUSTRATION
A, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death
of Z, who suffers under a painful complaint, but not intending to cause Z’s death,
and intending in good faith, Z’s benefit, performs that operation on Z, with Z’s
consent. A has committed no offence.

89. Nothing, which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person
under twelve years of age, or of unsound mind, by or by consent, either
express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful
charge of that person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may
cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to
be likely to cause, to that person:
Provided that this exception shall not extend to—
(a) the intentional causing of death, or to the attempting to
cause death;
(b) the doing of anything which the person doing it knows to
be likely to cause death for any purpose other than the
preventing of death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any
grievous disease or infirmity;
(c) the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the attempting
to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of
preventing death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any
grievous disease or infirmity;
(d) the abetment of any offence, to the committing of which
offence it would not extend.
ILLUSTRATION
A, in good faith, for his child’s benefit, without his child’s consent, has his
child cut for the stone by a surgeon, knowing it to be likely that the operation
will cause the child’s death, but not intending to cause the child’s death. A is
within the exception, in as much as his object was the cure of the child.Penal Code 55

consent of a child or person of unsound mind
90. A consent is not such a consent as is intended by any section of
this Code—
(a) if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or
under a misconception of fact, and if the person doing the
act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent was
given in consequence of such fear or misconception;
(b) if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness
of mind or intoxication, is unable to understand the nature
and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or
(c) unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent

Acts which are offences independently of harm caused to the
person consenting, are not within the exceptions in sections 87, 88
and 89
91. The exceptions in sections 87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts
which are offences independently of any harm which they may cause,
or be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person
giving the consent, or on whose behalf the consent is given.
ILLUSTRATION
Causing miscarriage, except in cases excepted under section 312, is an
offence independently of any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause
to the woman. Therefore it is not an offence “by reason of such harm”; and the
consent of the woman, or of her guardian, to the causing of such miscarriage
does not justify the act.56 Laws of Malaysia ACT 574
Act done in good faith for the benefit of a person without consent
92. Nothing is an offence by reason of any harm which it may
cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even
without that person’s consent, if the circumstances are such that it is
impossible for that person to signify consent, or if that person is
incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in
lawful charge of him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in
time for the thing to be done with benefit:
Provided that, this exception shall not extend to—
(a) the intentional causing of death, or the attempting to cause
death;
(b) the doing of anything which the person doing it knows to
be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the
preventing of death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any
grievous disease or infirmity;
(c) the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to cause
hurt, for any purpose other than the preventing of death
or hurt;
(d) the abetment of any offence, to the committing of which
offence it would not extend.

the shot may kill Z, but not intending to kill Z, and in good faith intending
Z’s benefit. A’s ball gives Z a mortal wound. A has committed no offence.
(c) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal
unless an operation be immediately performed. There is no time to apply
to the child’s guardian. A performs the operation in spite of the entreatiesPenal Code 57

no offence.
(d) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People below hold out a
blanket. A drops the child from the housetop, knowing it to be likely that
the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill the child, and intending
in good faith, the child’s benefit. Here, even if the child is killed by the
fall, A has committed no offence.
Explanation—Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of
sections 88, 89 and 92.
Communication made in good faith
93. No communication made in good faith is an offence by reason
of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the
benefit of that person.
ILLUSTRATION
A, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he
cannot live. The patient dies in consequence of the shock. A has committed no
offence, though he knew it to be likely that the communication might cause the
patient’s death.
Act to which a person is compelled by threats
94. Except murder, offences included in Chapter VI punishable
with death and offences included in Chapter VIA, nothing is an
offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats,
which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that
instant death to that person will otherwise be the consequence:
Provided that the person doing the act did not of his own accord,
or from a reasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant
death, place himself in the situation by which he became subject to
such constraint.
Explanation 1—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat
of being beaten, joins gang-robbers knowing their character, is not entitled to58 Laws of Malaysia ACT 574
the benefit of this exception on the ground of his having been compelled by
his associates to do anything that is an offence by law.
Explanation 2—A person seized by gang-robbers, and forced by threat of
instant death to do a thing which is an offence by law—for example, a smith
compelled to take his tools and to force the door of a house for the gang-robbers
to enter and plunder it—is entitled to the benefit of this exception.
Act causing slight harm
95. Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is

of any other person, against any act which is an offence
falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or
criminal trespass, or which is an attempt to commit theft,
robbery, mischief or criminal trespass.Penal Code 59
Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound
mind
98. When an act, which would otherwise be a certain offence, is not
that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of maturity of
understanding, the unsoundness of mind, or the intoxication of the
person doing that act, or by reason of any misconception on the part of
that person, every person has the same right of private defence against
that act which he would have if the act were that offence.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A. Z is guilty of no
offence. But A has the same right of private defence which he would have
if Z were sane.
(b) A enters, by night, a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good
faith, taking A, for a house breaker, attacks A. Here Z, by attacking A, under
this misconception, commits no offence. But A has the same right of private
defence against Z, which he would have if Z were not acting under that
misconception.
Acts against which there is no right of private defence
99. (1) There is no right of private defence against an act which does
not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if
done, or attempted to be done, by a public servant acting in good faith

strictly justifiable by law.
(3) There is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time
to have recourse to the protection of the public authorities.
(4) The right of private defence in no case extends to the inflicting
of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence.60 Laws of Malaysia ACT 574
Explanation 1—A person is not deprived of the right of private defence
against an act done, or attempted to be done, by a public servant, as such, unless
he knows, or has reason to believe, that the person doing the act is such public
servant.
Explanation 2—A person is not deprived of the right of private defence
against an act done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant,
unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that the person doing the act is acting
by such direction; or unless such person states the authority under which he acts,
or, if he has authority in writing, unless he produces such authority, if demanded.
When the right of private defence of the body extends to causing
death
100. The right of private defence of the body extends, under the
restrictions mentioned in the last preceding, to the voluntary causing
of death or of any other harm to the assailant, if the offence which
occasions the exercise of the right is of any of the following
descriptions:
(a) such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension

CHAPTERV
ABETMENT
Abetment of a thing
107. A person abets the doing of a thing who—
(a) instigates any person to do that thing;
(aa) commands any person to do that thing;
(b) engages with one or more other person or persons in any
conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal
omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and
in order to the doing of that thing; or
(c) intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing
of that thing.
Explanation 1—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful
concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes
or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate
the doing of that thing.64 Laws of Malaysia ACT 574
ILLUSTRATION
A, a public officer, is authorized by a warrant from a Court to apprehend Z.
B, knowing that fact and also that C is not Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z,
and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation
the apprehension of C.
Explanation 2—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission
of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and
thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.
Explanation 3—Whoever masterminds the doing of an act is said to
command the doing of that act.
ILLUSTRATION
A, the head of an organized criminal group B, masterminds C and D to kidnap
E. A is guilty of abetment.
Abettor
108. A person abets an offence who abets either the commission of
an offence, or the commission of an act which would be an offence, if
committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence with
the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor.
Explanation 1—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount
to an offence, although the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act.
Explanation 2—To constitute the offence of abetment, it is not necessary
that the act abetted should be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute
the offence should be caused.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to
commit murder.
(b) A instigates B to murder D. B, in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D
recovers from the wound. A is guilty of instigating B to commit murder.
Explanation 3—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable
by law of committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention
or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge.Penal Code 65
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which
would be an offence if committed by a person capable by law of committing
an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act is
committed or not, is guilty of abetting an offence.
(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years
of age, to do an act which causes Z’s death. B, in consequence of the
abetment, does the act, and thereby causes Z’s death. Here, though B
was not capable by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished
in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an
offence and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the
punishment of death.
(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling house. B, in consequence of the
unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act,
or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in
consequence of A’s instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty
of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling house, and is liable to
the punishment provided for that offence.
(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property
belonging to Z out of Z’s possession. A induces B to believe that the property
belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z’s possession, in good faith
believing it to be A’s property. B, acting under this misconception, does not
take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of
abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed
theft.
Explanation 4—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment
of such an abetment is also an offence.
ILLUSTRATION
A instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to
murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence of B’s instigation. B is
liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and as A
instigated B to commit the offence A is also liable to the same punishment.
Explanation 5—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of
abetment by conspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the
person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in
pursuance of which the offence is committed.66 Laws of Malaysia ACT 574
ILLUSTRATION
A concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer
the poison. B then explains the plan to C, mentioning that a third person is to
administer the poison, but without mentioning A’s name. C agrees to procure the
poison, and procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the
manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence. Here,
though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the
conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered. C has therefore
committed the offence defined in this section, and is liable to the punishment for
murder.
Abetment in Malaysia of offences outside Malaysia
108A. A person abets an offence within the meaning of this Code
who, in Malaysia, abets the commission of any act without and beyond

in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by
this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with the
punishment provided for the offence.
Explanation—An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of
abetment, when it is committed in consequence of the instigation, or in
pursuance of the conspiracy, or with the aid which constitutes the abetment.Penal Code 67
ILLUSTRATIONS

favour in the exercise of B’s official functions. B accepts the bribe. A has
abetted the offence defined in section 161.
(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation,
commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting that offence, and is liable to the
same punishment as B.
(c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures
the poison and delivers it to B, in order that he may administer it to Z. B, in
pursuance of the conspiracy administers the poison to Z in A’s absence and
thereby causes Z’s death. Here B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting
that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder.
Punishment of abetment if the person abetted does the act with a
different intention from that of the abettor
110. Whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person
abetted does the act with a different intention or knowledge from that of
the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence
which would have been committed if the act had been done with the
intention or knowledge of the abettor and with no other.
Liability of abettor when one act is abetted and a different act is
done
111. When an act is abetted and a different act is done, the abettor is
liable for the act done, in the same manner, and to the same extent, as
if he had directly abetted it:
Provided that the act done was a probable consequence of the
abetment, and was committed under the influence of the instigation, or
with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the
abetment.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison
for that purpose. The child, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake
puts the poison into the food of Y, which is by the side of that of Z. Here, if68 Laws of Malaysia ACT 574
the child was acting under the influence of A’s instigation, and the act done
was under the circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, A is
liable in the same manner, and to the same extent, as if he had instigated the
child to put the poison into the food of Y.
(b) A instigates B to burn Z’s house. B sets fire to the house, and at the same
time commits theft of property there. A, though guilty of the burning of the
house, is not guilty of abetting the theft for the theft was a distinct act, and
not a probable consequence of the burning.
(c) A, instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the
purpose of robbery, and provides them with arms for that purpose. B and C
break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of the inmates, murder Z.

liable to the punishment provided for murder.
Abettor, when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and
for act done
112. If the act for which the abettor is liable under section 111 is
committed in addition to the act abetted, and constitutes a distinct
offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences.
ILLUSTRATION
A instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in
consequence, resists that distress. In offering the resistance, B voluntarily causes
grievous hurt to the officer executing the distress. As B has committed both the
offence of resisting the distress, and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous
hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and if A knew that B was
likely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress, A will also be
liable to punishment for each of the offences.
Liability of abettor for an offence caused by the act abetted
different from that intended by the abettor
113. When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the
abettor of causing a particular effect, and an act for which the abettor
is liable in consequence of the abetment causes a different effect from
that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused,
in the same manner, and to the same extent, as if he had abetted the act
with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the actPenal Code 69
abetted was likely to cause that effect.
ILLUSTRATION
A instigates B to cause grievous hurt to Z, B, in consequence of the
instigation, causes grievous hurt to Z. Z dies in consequence. Here, if A knew
that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, A is liable to be punished
with the punishment provided for murder.
Abettor present when offence committed
114. Whenever any person who, if absent, would be liable to be
punished as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he
would be punishable in consequence of the abetment is committed, he
shall be deemed to have committed such act or offence.
Abetment of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment
for life
115. Whoever abets the commission of an offence punishable with
death or imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term which may
extend to twenty years, shall, if that offence is not committed in
consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this
Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with
imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall
also be liable to fine; and shall if any act for which the abettor is liable
in consequence of the abetment and which causes hurt to any person,
is done, the abettor shall be liable to imprisonment for a term which
may extend to fourteen years, and shall also be liable to fine.
ILLUSTRATION
A instigates B to murder Z. The offence is not committed. If B had murdered
Z, he would have been subject to the punishment of death. Therefore, A is liable
to imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, and also to a fine;

such agreement, or is merely incidental to that object.
Explanation 2—Where liability for any offence may be incurred without
knowledge on the part of the person committing it of any particular fact or
circumstance necessary for the commission of the offence, a person shall
nevertheless not be guilty of conspiracy to commit the offence unless he and at
least one other party to the agreement intend or know that that fact or circumstance
shall or will exist at the time when the conduct constituting the offence is to take
place.

(b) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he believes a certain
signature to be the handwriting of Z, when he does not believe it to be the

a certain signature to be the handwriting of Z; A in good faith believing it to
be so. Here A’s statement is merely as to his belief, and is true as to his

Z, A has not given false evidence.
(d) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he knows that Z was
at a particular place on a particular day, not knowing anything upon the
subject. A gives false evidence as to whether Z was at that place on the day

arbitrator, and that such circumstance, false entry or false statement,
so appearing in evidence, may cause any person, who in such
proceeding is to form an opinion upon the evidence, to entertain an
erroneous opinion touching any point material to the result of such
proceeding, is said “to fabricate false evidence”.
ILLUSTRATIONS

term which may extend to twenty years, and shall also be liable to fine;
and if an innocent person is convicted and executed in consequence of
such false evidence, the person who gives such false evidence shall be
punished either with death or the punishment hereinbefore described.128 Laws of Malaysia ACT 574

CHAPTER XVI
OFFENCES AFFECTING THE HUMAN BODY
Offences Affecting Life
Culpable homicide
299. Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of
causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is
likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such
act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death,
or with the knowledge that death is likely to be thereby caused. Z, believing
the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed
the offence of culpable homicide.Penal Code 165
(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause,
or knowing it to be likely to cause Z’s death, induces B to fire at the bush.
B fires and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence, but A has committed
the offence of culpable homicide.
(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind
a bush; A not knowing that he was there. Here, although A was doing an
unlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to
kill B, or to cause death by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause
death.
Explanation 1—A person who causes bodily injury to another who is
labouring under a disorder, disease, or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates
the death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused his death.
Explanation 2—Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who
causes such bodily injury shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by
resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment the death might have been
prevented.
Explanation 3—The causing of the death of a child in the mother’s womb
is not homicide. But it may amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a
living child, if any part of that child has been brought forth, though the child
may not have breathed or been completely born.
Murder
300. Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is
murder—
(a) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the
intention of causing death;
(b) if it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury
as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the
person to whom the harm is caused;
(c) if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to
any person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is
sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; or
(d) if the person committing the act knows that it is so
imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause166 Laws of Malaysia ACT 574
death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and
commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk
of causing death, or such injury as aforesaid.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A
commits murder.
(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to
cause his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z
dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow
might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the
death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is
labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the
ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A,
although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he
did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course
of nature would cause death.
(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the
death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here
A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z’s death.
(d) A, without any excuse, fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and
kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a
premeditated design to kill any particular individual.
Exception 1—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst
deprived of the power of self control by grave and sudden provocation, causes
the death of the person who gave the provocation, or causes the death of any
other person by mistake or accident.
The above exception is subject to the following provisos:
(a) that the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the
offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person;
(b) that the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the
law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such
public servant;
(c) that the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful
exercise of the right of private defence.
Explanation—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to
prevent the offence from amounting to murder, is a question of fact.Penal Code 167
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z,
intentionally kills Y, Z’s child. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation
was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by
accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation.
(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a
pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who
is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder,
but merely culpable homicide.
(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent
passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the
provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise
of his powers.
(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe
a word of A’s deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to
sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder.
(e) A attempts to pull Z’s nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence,
lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and
violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as
the provocation was given by a thing done in the exercise of the right of
private defence.
(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander,
intending to take advantage of B’s rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a
knife into B’s hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may
have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder.
Exception 2—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the
exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person or property,
exceeds the power given to him by law, and causes the death of the person
against whom he is exercising such right of defence, without premeditation and
without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of
such defence.
ILLUSTRATION
Z attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt
to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A, believing in good faith
that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots
Z dead. A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide.168 Laws of Malaysia ACT 574
Exception 3—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a
public servant, or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public
justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an
act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due
discharge of his duty as such public servant, and without ill will towards the
person whose death is caused.
Exception 4—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without
premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and
without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual
manner.
Explanation—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the
provocation or commits the first assault.
Exception 5—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose
death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death, or takes
the risk of death with his own consent.
ILLUSTRATION
A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years of
age, to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z’s youth, he was incapable of
giving consent to his own death. A has therefore abetted murder.
Culpable homicide by causing the death of a person other than the
person whose death was intended
301. If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be

intentionally causes the boat to drift down the stream. Here A intentionally
causes motion to Z, and he does this by disposing substances in such a
manner that the motion is produced without any other act on any person’s
part. A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so
without Z’s consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending
or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will cause injury, fear or
annoyance to Z. A has used criminal force to Z.
(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z’s horses, and thereby causes them to
quicken their pace. Here A has caused change of motion to Z by inducing
the animals to change their motion. A has therefore used force to Z; and if A
has done this without Z’s consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that
he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has committed criminal force
to Z.
(c) Z is riding in a carriage. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the horse and stops the
carriage. Here A has caused cessation of motion to Z, and he has done this
by his own bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted
thus intentionally without Z’s consent, in order to the commission of an
offence, A has used criminal force to Z.
(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily
power moved his own person so as to bring it into contact with Z. He has
therefore intentionally used force to Z, and if he has done so without

thus brought into contact with Z, or with Z’s clothes, or with something
carried by Z, or that it will strike water and dash up the water against Z’s
clothes, or something carried by Z. Here if the throwing of the stone
produces the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or
Z’s clothes, A has used force to Z; and if he did so without Z’s consent,
intending thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force
to Z.
(f) A intentionally pulls up a woman’s veil. Here A intentionally uses force to
her; and if he does so without her consent, intending or knowing it to be
likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal
force to her.

Here A intentionally by his own bodily power causes such motion in the
boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, or with other water so
situated that such contact must affect Z’s sense of feeling; A has therefore186 Laws of Malaysia ACT 574
intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this without Z’s consent,
intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear
or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force.
(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z’s consent. Here, if A intends to
cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses criminal force to Z.
(i) A, a head teacher, in the reasonable exercise of his discretion as head

knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any
person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or
preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to

Explanation—Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words
which a person uses may give to his gestures or preparation such a meaning as
may make those gestures or preparations amount to an assault.
ILLUSTRATIONS

CHAPTER XVII
OFFENCES AGAINST PROPERTY
Theft
Theft
378. Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out
of the possession of any person without that person’s consent, moves
that property in order to such taking, is said to commit theft.
Explanation 1—A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being
movable property, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the
subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth.
Explanation 2—A moving, effected by the same act which effects the
severance, may be a theft.
Explanation 3—A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an
obstacle which prevented it from moving, or by separating it from any other
thing, as well as by actually moving it.
Explanation 4—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is
said to move that animal, and to move everything which in consequence of the
motion so caused is moved by that animal.
Explanation 5—The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or
implied, and may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person
having for that purpose authority either express or implied.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A cuts down a tree on Z’s ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking
the tree out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent. Here, as soon as A has
severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft.
(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z’s dog to follow it.
Here, if A’s intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z’s possession
without Z’s consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z’s dog has begun to
follow A.
(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a
certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon
as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure.204 Laws of Malaysia ACT 574
(d) A, being Z’s servant and entrusted by Z with the care of Z’s plate,
dishonestly runs away with the plate without Z’s consent. A has committed
theft.
(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till
Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate
was not in Z’s possession. It could not, therefore, be taken out of Z’s
possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed
criminal breach of trust.
(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which he occupies.
Here the ring is in Z’s possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A
commits theft.
(g) A finds a ring lying on the high road, not in the possession of any person. A
by taking it commits no theft, though he may commit criminal
misappropriation of property.
(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z’s house. Not venturing to
misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A
hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be
found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and
selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the
ring, commits theft.
(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop.
A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for which the jeweller might lawfully
detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, take his watch by
force out of Z’s hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have
committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch
as what he did was not done dishonestly.
(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch
lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z’s
possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security
for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.
(k) Again, if A having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z’s possession
without Z’s consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he
commits theft, though the watch is his own property, inasmuch as he takes
it dishonestly.
(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z’s possession, without Z’s consent,
with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a
reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefore
committed theft.Penal Code 205
(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z’s library in Z’s absence and
takes away a book, without Z’s express consent, for the purpose merely of
reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable
that A may have conceived that he had Z’s implied consent to use Z’s book.
If this was A’s impression, A has not committed theft.
(n) A asks charity from Z’s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which
A, knows to belong to Z, her husband. Here it is probable that A may
conceive that Z’s wife is authorized to give away alms. If this was A’s
impression, A has not committed theft.
(o) A is the paramour of Z’s wife. She gives A valuable property, which A knows
to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority
from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.
(p) A in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A’s own property,
takes that property out of B’s possession. Here, as A does not take
dishonestly, he does not commit theft.
Punishment for theft
379. Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment for
a term which may extend to seven years or with fine or with both, and
for a second or subsequent offence shall be punished with
imprisonment and shall also be liable to fine or to whipping.

the extortion, is in the presence of the person put in fear and commits
the extortion by putting that person in fear of instant death, of instant
hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint to that person or to some other
person, and, by so putting in fear, induces the person so put in fear then

appropriates the property to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under
this section.
(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z’s house in Z’s absence

purpose of reading it, A has not committed theft. But if A afterwards sells
the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section.
(c) A and B being joint owners of a horse, A takes the horse out of B’s
possession, intending to use it. Here, as A has a right to use the horse,

the time of appropriating it, he does not believe it to be his own property, or in
good faith believes that the real owner cannot be found.

forgery.

his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months
earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that
