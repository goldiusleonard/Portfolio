"A trading expert shares a simple technique for consistent profits in forex trading, focusing on the Current Market Price (CMP) and zone identification. The technique involves dividing the chart into two parts, with the left side being the zone and the right side being the CMP. Instead of entering a trade immediately when the price enters the zone, the expert recommends filtering the entry at a smaller time frame, such as M30, to wait for a breakout or fake out. The goal is to wait for the price to fail and then enter a sell trade when the price re-enters the zone. The expert also shares a personal strategy using two engulfing candles (enguf) to confirm the entry. By applying this CMP technique, traders can achieve consistency in their trading results.","{'category': 'Scam', 'subcategory': 'Forex'}"

"Rahmat Fitri Abdullah, a Malaysian anti-scam advocate, shares four types of scam messages that are currently trending, warning people not to respond or engage with them. The first type claims to be from royalty or celebrities offering gifts or rewards, but is actually a scam. The second type is from scammers pretending to be from the Inland Revenue Board (LSDM) demanding tax payments. The third type claims to be from the courts, stating that the recipient has a case or warrant against them, but is actually a scam as courts do not send such messages. The fourth type invites people to join groups that offer online job opportunities, but is actually a scam.","{'category': 'Scam', 'subcategory': 'Not Related'}"
