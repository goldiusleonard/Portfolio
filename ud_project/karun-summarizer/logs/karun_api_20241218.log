The image tag includes a dynamic build ID for versioning. Pods expose port 8001 for the application. Service: Exposes the pods externally via a LoadBalancer. Routes traffic to port 8001 on the pods. The current selector misalignment (as per the comment) may prevent routing traffic until fixed. This setup ensures scalability, redundancy, and external access to the application.
