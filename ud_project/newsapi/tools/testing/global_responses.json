Speaking to ANI, Ritambhara called for unity among Hindus. Ritambhara said, \u201cWho is in this world that may not be pained by the atrocities on the Hindus of Bangladesh?... It causes a huge pain when one\u2019s own nation becomes one\u2019s enemy... The government of the country has taken a direct initiative that our relations (with Bangladesh) can remain good only when our feelings are respected... Leave aside religion, sect or community, but there is something called humanity... The Hindu community should abandon all its different beliefs and become one. There is strength in unity, we should all remain united and only then the future will be safe, the present will also be safe...\u201d ISKCON Kolkata Vice President Radharaman Das told ANI that he hoped for peace to return in Bangladesh. Das said, \u201cThe visit of Foreign Secretary of India Vikram Misri to Bangladesh was very important and all of us were waiting for the outcome. The statement made by Vikram Misri after meeting his counterparts, we expect that soon peace will return to Bangladesh. We have seen that for the last few days, the fundamentalists are issuing a genocide call against the minorities of Bangladesh. We hope that the Bangladeshi government will take firm action against these people.\u201d Sadhguru Shri Riteshwar Ji Maharaj of Shri Anandam Dham Peeth, Vrindavan, said that the initiative taken by Misri was a good one, as Bangladesh was a neighbouring country and any unrest there would affect India. He said, \u201cThis is a good initiative because Bangladesh is a neighbouring country and any kind of unrest in a neighbouring country affects the neighbours. After the change of government in Bangladesh, atrocities on Hindus have increased and temples have been attacked. Our foreign secretary has expressed this concern. Now we hope that the Bangladesh government will accept this concern of India and will protect the Hindus of their country... This matter is not just about Hindus or any two countries, it is a matter of humanity... India\u2019s concern is justified... We hope that Bangladesh will immediately take strict steps for the protection of the minorities there... We welcome this initiative of India and also tell the people of other countries that you should also express concern on this and go and raise the issue of the protection of minorities in Bangladesh. Protecting humanity is our first duty.\u201d Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, called on chief advisor to the interim government in Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus on Monday, who called the relationships between Dhaka and New Delhi as \u201cvery solid\u201d and \u201cclose,\u201d according to a statement released by his office.

                    "content": "\u201ci smein koee sandeh na rakhen\u2014hamaaree ekata hee hamaara sabse bada hathiyaar hai. Hamen na vibhaajit kiya ja sakta hai, na hee shaant kiya ja sakta hai. Jab jab ve hamen peechhe dhakelate hain, ham aage badhate hain. Jab jab ve hamen shaant karana chaahate hain, hamaaree hool, ulagulaan, kraanti kee aavaaz aur prakhar hotee jaateehai, kyoonki ham jhaarakhandee hain, aur jhaarakhandee jhukate nahin hai.\u201d (Let there be no doubt about it\u2014our unity is our biggest weapon. We can neither be divided nor silenced. Whenever they push us back, we will move forward. Whenever they try to silence us, our chants of Hoolah, Ulgulan, Kranti (revolution) will become louder because we are Jharkhandis, and Jharkhandis do not bow down.) These words were posted by Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren on social media just two hours before taking oath as the 14th chief minister of the state in Ranchi on November 28, 2024. The essence of his words was a target on the Opposition and the feeling of overwhelming majority, tribalism, Jharkhandism and unity. Over the 24 years since Jharkhand\u2019s formation, there have been various political experiments. Governments have fallen and President\u2019s Rule has been imposed several times. The state has been a subject of national discussion due to allegations of corruption and the government\u2019s instability. However, the government that has been formed under Soren is considered to be the strongest. Soren hopes to avoid the instability seen by previous governments, but his biggest challenge will be fulfilling the promises and unfinished tasks from his previous term. One of them is converting the bills, now with the Governor, into law. These bills were central to the electoral campaign of his party, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), and helped strike a chord with a large section of the electorate. Political analyst Anand Kumar believes that there is a problem in all three bills. \u201cWill all tribals in the country unite on the Sarna Dharma Code? Firstly, tribals follow many religions and a majority of tribals who believe in Sarna are mostly from Jharkhand. Secondly, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Sangh consider Sarna and Sanatana to be the same. In such a situation, they would not want the tribals to get a different religion code in the name of Sarna,\u201d he says. A similar controversy confronts the 1932 Khatiyan Bill. After the formation of Jharkhand, when the first chief minister of the state and BJP leader, Babulal Marandi, tried to include third and fourth-grade jobs in the bill, the Jharkhand High Court struck it down. On the other hand, in the tribal-dominated Kolhan region of Jharkhand, the tribals are opposing this. The last survey in Kolhan is not of 1932, but of 1964-65. According to this, the Khatiyan Bill of 1932 cannot be implemented here. Former Jharkhand Chief Minister and BJP leader Madhu Koda hails from Kolhan and is among the people who have expressed their objection to the implementation of the bill in Kolhan. \u201cI have never opposed domicile, but the 1932 Khatiyan Bill passed by the government is neither practical nor constitutional. There are many legal hurdles. If it is implemented, many people of the state will be deprived of their domicile. If you take the example of Kolhan, the last survey was in 1964. The 1932 Khatiyan Bill was not introduced keeping the long-term interests in mind. Instead, this bill was introduced in a hurry for vote politics without taking the opinion of the stakeholders. Implementing it without amendment is not in the interest of the state,\u201d says Koda. Koda\u2019s opinion on the Sarna Dharma Code is the same as the 1932 Khatiyan Bill. He says that before bringing both the bills, the government should have convened an all-party meeting to take all tribals in the country into confidence. But it did not happen. According to Koda, Soren and his party have brought this only as a political agenda. BY Outlook Web Desk Bandhu Tirkey, a former minister in the Jharkhand government and a Congress leader, also believes that the state government should reconsider these bills. He says, \u201cThere is a contradiction in the 1932 Khatiyan Bill. A team of experts should be formed to consider all the places where the last survey was conducted, so that we can find a way to implement it. And it should be executed within a time frame.\u201d Tirkey says that such a way should be found on domicile issues so that no injustice is done to anyone. He also demands that the Sarna Dharma Code is a serious issue related to tribal identity, so the Union government and the President should consider it. On the reservation issue, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Indra Sawhney case of 1993 can be an obstacle in the reservation bill, in which it has been said that not more than 50 per cent reservation should be given. The bill brought by Soren has a provision of 77 per cent reservation. Kumar says that there are immense legal hurdles to implement these bills and it seems that Soren\u2019s government has used it merely as a political tool. Voters Influenced by Key Issues Analysing the results of the assembly polls, in the last election, the ruling alliance had secured 47 seats\u2014the JMM won 30, the Congress 16 and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) 1 seat\u2014while this time, the alliance won 56 seats\u2014the JMM 34, the Congress 16, the RJD 4 and the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist or CPI-ML) 2 seats\u2014an increase of 11 per cent in seats over five years. In a state where governments have often been unstable, the increase in the number of seats can largely be attributed to the legislative bills mentioned above. For instance, the Sarna Dharma Code and the 1932 Khatiyan Bill were issues that the previous governments had been ambiguous about. When Soren came to power in 2019, he made historic decisions. On November 11, 2020, the Sarna Code Bill was passed by the Jharkhand Assembly. Two years later, on November 11, 2022, a proposal for the 1932 Khatiyan Bill to determine the eligibility of the local residents was also passed. In addition, the government also introduced a bill to increase reservations for Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Scheduled Castes (SCs) groups. While the ST and SC reservations saw a partial increase, the OBC reservation was raised from 14 per cent to 27 per cent. Political analysts consider these three decisions to have had significant political and electoral benefits. An analysis of results from the 14 Lok Sabha and 81 assembly seats reveals that the Sarna Code proposal had a direct impact on the 42 lakh Sarna followers, who are a tribal group. The 1932 Khatiyan Bill affected the state\u2019s indigenous population politically, and it benefited the JMM-led INDIA bloc. The OBC reservation bill also helped the coalition make inroads into the backward sections of society that comprise 55 per cent of the state\u2019s population. BY Anand Teltumbde The BJP had won 12 seats in 2014 and 2019 parliamentary polls, but lost three in 2024. All of these seats are reserved for tribals. Notably, the results in the Khunti and Lohardaga assembly segments were surprising. Between 1989 and 2019, the BJP had won these constituencies in nine general elections, including eight times in Khunti and six times in Lohardaga. Similarly, the JMM alliance secured victories in 27 out of the 28 reserved assembly seats for tribals, including both seats in Khunti, which were earlier held by the BJP. According to statistics, the Sarna followers, primarily the Oraon and Munda tribes, are concentrated in regions like Khunti and Gumla. These areas, with seats reserved for tribals, saw victories for Soren\u2019s alliance. Challenges with PESA and Land Bank The Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act (PESA), 1996, and the Land Bank were key issues Soren raised during the 2019 assembly election. He frequently targeted the BJP government led by Raghubar Das on these issues. To understand why the Land Bank became a key electoral issue, it is important to look at the amendments to the Land Acquisition Act, 2013. In 2015, the Narendra Modi government tried to amend the Act\u2019s provisions. In 2017, the then Chief Minister Das introduced similar amendments. The tribal community strongly opposed these changes\u2014both on the streets as well as on the floor of the House. The revised provisions diluted the powers of the Gram Sabha, thereby removing social impact assessments required before land acquisition for any project. A Land Bank was created to include land for corporate use, and approximately 21 lakh acres of land were added to it. The Opposition claimed that much of the land included was used by tribal and indigenous communities. The tribal community vehemently opposed the Land Bank, and Soren, as a Leader of Opposition, vowed to abolish it if he came to power. However, in his previous term, he could neither abolish the Land Bank nor frame the rules for PESA. Activist Vineet Mundu, associated with the Adivasi Swashashan Adhikar Manch (ASAM), says that Soren was not serious on issues of Jal, Jungle, Zameen during his last five years in power. \u201cSoren and his party did not take any step in the direction of cancelling the Land Bank as they had talked about while being in the Opposition. The rules of PESA were ready, but they have not been implemented yet. It seems that there is pressure from the corporate lobby on Soren\u2019s government.\u201d Mundu further says that when the rules are implemented, the acquisition of state land and the rights over minor minerals will be under the Gram Sabha. In such a situation, it will be very difficult to make this land available for the corporate lobby. \u201cIn this regard, cancelling the land bank and implementing the PESA law is also becoming difficult for Soren,\u201d says Mundu. Despite these complexities, the JMM believes that Soren will manage to resolve all these issues in the coming five years. JMM General Secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya states that since no legal action can be taken on the bills pending with the Governor, the government will apply pressure to push them forward so they can become laws. He also says that the rules for PESA will soon be finalised, and the Land Bank will be abolished. ( Translated by Tarique Anwar ) (This appeared in the print as 'Delivery Time')",

Das said, \"The visit of Foreign Secretary of India Vikram Misri to Bangladesh was very important and all of us were waiting for the outcome. The statement made by Vikram Misri after meeting his counterparts, we expect that soon peace will return to Bangladesh. We have seen that for the last few days, the fundamentalists are issuing a genocide call against the minorities of Bangladesh. We hope that the Bangladeshi government will take firm action against these people.\" Sadhguru Shri Riteshwar Ji Maharaj of Shri Anandam Dham Peeth, Vrindavan, said that the initiative taken by Misri was a good one, as Bangladesh was a neighbouring country and any unrest there would affect India. He said, \"This is a good initiative because Bangladesh is a neighbouring country and any kind of unrest in a neighbouring country affects the neighbours. After the change of government in Bangladesh, atrocities on Hindus have increased and temples have been attacked. Our foreign secretary has expressed this concern. Now we hope that the Bangladesh government will accept this concern of India and will protect the Hindus of their country... This matter is not just about Hindus or any two countries, it is a matter of humanity... India's concern is justified... We hope that Bangladesh will immediately take strict steps for the protection of the minorities there... We welcome this initiative of India and also tell the people of other countries that you should also express concern on this and go and raise the issue of the protection of minorities in Bangladesh. Protecting humanity is our first duty.\" Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, called on chief advisor to the interim government in Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus on Monday, who called the relationships between Dhaka and New Delhi as \"very solid\" and \"close,\" according to a statement released by his office.

                    "description": "Indian news outlets and social media platforms have been spreading various types of disinformation about the persecution of religious minorities in Bangladesh.",
                    "content": "Ever since the fall of the Bangladeshi dictator Sheikh Hasina in the student-citizen uprising of July-August, Indian news outlets and social media platforms have been spreading various types of disinformation about the persecution of religious minorities in Bangladesh. The disinformation includes portraying attacks on Awami League (AL) leaders as attacks on Hindus, arson attacks on AL offices as burning of temples, spreading images of past attacks or fires as images of recent events etc. According to an investigation by Rumor Scanner , a Bangladeshi fact-checking organisation, as many as 49 Indian media outlets spread at least 13 false reports about Bangladesh between August 12 and December 5, 2024. Out of this, Republic Bangla has propagated a maximum of five rumours. The Hindustan Times , Zee News, and Live Mint each spread three false reports. Meanwhile, Republic, India Today , ABP Anand, and Aaj Tak each broadcasted two false reports. The remaining 41 media outlets spread one false report each. The rumours spread by these Indian media, according to Rumor Scanner, included: a fake letter from Sheikh Hasina after her resignation; a video of a Muslim man falsely claimed as Hindu during a search for his son; false reports about Bangladesh's Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus's health and location; baseless claims of withdrawal of bans on militant groups; arms smuggling via a ship from Pakistan; misrepresentation of lawyer Saiful Islam's murder; alleged ban on Indian TV channels; idol immersion in India misrepresented as a reaction to attacks on Hindu idols in Bangladesh; an alleged attack on a Shyamoli Paribahan bus from India; and false UK travel advisories for Bangladesh. The political motive behind Indian propaganda on the allegations of minority persecution in Bangladesh can be understood by looking at the statistics of attacks on minorities during the previous Awami League government led by Sheikh Hasina. As many as 3,679 attacks on the Hindu community took place in the nine years, between January 2013 and September 2021, according to a compilation of data from the annual reports of the human-rights organisation Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK) during that period. The attacks included vandalism and setting fire to 559 houses and 442 shops and businesses of the Hindu community. At least 1,678 cases of vandalism and arson attacks on Hindu temples, idols and places of worship were also reported in the same period. Recent ASK data shows the number of attacks on minorities in 2022 and 2023 was 12 and 22 , respectively, and between January to July 2024, there were 28 such attacks. The attacks are random in nature, influenced by various local and national political and economic factors. For example, during the first six months of 2024 when Sheikh Hasina was in power, attacks on minorities in January, February and March were 10, seven and four, respectively, while incidents of attack in April, May and June were zero, three and three, respectively. It must be noted that news reports are one of the sources of ASK data. After the current interim government assumed responsibility, there were 10 and 11 attacks on minorities in September and October 2024, respectively, based on ASK statistics. A year ago in September and October 2023, there were eight and three attacks . But three years ago, in just three days of October 2021 , while Hasina was in power, 70 puja venues, 30 homes and 50 shops were vandalised, torched and looted in different parts of the country. The Hindu community faced the highest number of attacks in 2014; as many as 761 Hindu homes, 193 businesses and 247 temples and places of worship were attacked that year. Therefore, attacks on minority groups in Bangladesh have not started suddenly after the fall of Sheikh Hasina. Over the years, various motives\u2014from land grabbing to local political conflicts and even posts about religion on Facebook\u2014led to attacks on the Hindu community and sometimes other marginalised groups in Bangladesh. Of course, these are very sad and unacceptable incidents and many Bangladeshis are fighting and protesting against these attacks, just like many Indians protest attacks on minorities in their country. However, an important difference between the situation in Bangladesh and India is that there is no communal political party in power in Bangladesh like India's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which itself is accused of patronising communal violence. Now the question is, why have the Indian Hindutva groups, engaged in attacking and torturing the minority population in their own country because of communal hatred, suddenly become so agitated about the allegations of minority persecution in Bangladesh? What was their reaction when the Hindu community was regularly attacked during Sheikh Hasina's regime? Did they attack the High Commission of Bangladesh in India then as they recently did in Agartala? Did they stop the export of onions and potatoes to Bangladesh and urge the United Nations to send peacekeeping forces to Bangladesh? In fact, all this is being done for political gain by creating communal tension. On the one hand, the Indian ruling class cannot accept the painful reality of losing dominance over Bangladesh after Hasina's fall. India's various strategic interests such as road, sea and rail transit through Bangladesh, using the Bangladeshi seaports, hydropower transmission from their northeastern to the southern, western and northern regions, economic zones, businesses in the energy sector etc are now facing uncertainties. On the other hand, BJP and its affiliated organisations are carrying out anti-Bangladesh propaganda in a planned manner to portray themselves as the protectors of the Hindu community. A statement issued by the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights (APDR), a human rights organisation of West Bengal, on December 1 is important to understand the political motive behind this. The statement read \"the Indian government or the BJP has no moral right to say anything about the oppression of minorities in Bangladesh. Minority Muslims, Christians, and Buddhists are being persecuted continuously in India. Dalits and tribal people are also suffering. Just a few days ago, the Uttar Pradesh police shot dead six people of the minority community in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal. Many Muslim political leaders and social activists including Abu Bakr, Umar Khalid, Gulfisha Fatima, Sharjeel Imam have been put in jail. By taking away OBC reservation, bringing waqf bill, making uniform civil rules, and digging up temples under mosques, many rights of minorities have been or are being taken away. Thousands of minority families have been displaced by bulldozers in Uttar Pradesh and Assam.\" That's why, the APDR stated that the Indian government's statement about protecting the right of expression of minorities in Bangladesh is nothing but crocodile tears. The Modi government has no right to demand equal rights for minorities in other countries by turning minorities into second-class citizens at home. This is just an attempt to spread political dominance over Bangladesh and create opportunities for unfair interference. People of both countries should be aware and careful about this Hindutva agenda of the BJP and its affiliates. Meanwhile, communal attacks in Bangladesh must not be justified just because India's minority population is being attacked or because Hindus were attacked during Hasina's tenure in Bangladesh. People, political organisations and the government of post-Hasina Bangladesh have the responsibility to bring down the attacks on all religious and ethnic minorities, including Hindus, to zero, ensure that the attackers are brought to book and given exemplary punishment. Furthermore, the government should take the initiative to debunk every kind of misinformation propagated by the Indian media and communicate it to both Indian and International media. For this, a special monitoring team can be formed to investigate each incident through local and foreign independent fact-checkers and bring out the real facts. Most importantly, unity and solidarity should be enhanced with the secular and democratic people and organisations of India who are fighting against the communal politics.

                    "content": "By Molly Farrar New Hampshire\u2019s capital city said it will allow the Satanic Temple to join their nativity scene this holiday season, in part \u201cto avoid litigation.\u201d The City of Concord said in a statement that the temple, or TST, received a permit to place their monument during December near the city\u2019s nativity scene near the New Hampshire Statehouse. \u201cThe Satanic Temple has been making requests to install its monuments at holiday displays as part (of) a show of unity and religious pluralism,\u201d the city said on Facebook . \u201cThroughout the country, the Satanic Temple has both threatened and brought lawsuits under the First Amendment when excluded.\u201d The Satanic Temple, which is based in Salem, Massachusetts, erected a statue of Baphomet, a deity and occult symbol with yellow eyes. The statue also wears a purple stole with upside crosses, and a tablet with the temple\u2019s seven fundamental tenets sits before the statue. Leaders with TST unveiled the statue Saturday night, where TST Minister for New Hampshire and Vermont Vivian Kelly praised the city\u2019s decision to include them. \u201cIt takes a lot of courage to stand up, and for someone to do so in politics really warms my heart,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cJust because we\u2019re not large in numbers doesn\u2019t mean our beliefs are less important than any of the other religions represented here.\u201d The City of Concord said \u201cunder the First Amendment and to avoid litigation,\u201d they had to choose between banning all holiday displays installed or allowing TST\u2019s monument. \u201cAfter reviewing its legal options, the City ultimately decided to continue the policy of allowing unattended displays at City Plaza during this holiday season and to allow the statue,\u201d their statement read. Concord Mayor Byron Champlin was critical of the display in an interview with The Boston Globe and said he will appoint a committee to evaluate the city\u2019s options to regulate unattended displays. \u201cI opposed the permit on the basis that the request was not made in the interest of promoting religious equity, but to drive an anti-religious political agenda leveraging the attention one can receive during this time of year,\u201d he told the Globe . The Globe reported that within 48 hours, the tablet had been cracked and chunks of text were missing. TST did not return a request for comment Monday evening.

                    "content": "The collapse of the Bashar-al Assad regime in Syria was unexpected; more so as Assad appeared to have Syria in control except for the area near the border with Turkiye , and was now acceptable to the Arab leaders who had once treated him like a pariah. Yet, the end came swiftly with the Syrian army offering no resistance. The end of the Assad dynasty\u2019s rule has changed the power equation in West Asia . There has been a dramatic reshuffle on the chess board of the region. The Russia-Syria-Iran axis has been broken. Supporters of the Sunni rebels, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE and other Gulf-Arab states will now be calling the shots. The US and its European allies are delighted because Bashar al Assad, with his close ties to Iran and Russia was the enemy on the ground. The Assad regime, despite its many faults, was largely secular and did not discriminate on the basis of religion. On a visit to Syria just before the civil war began, a nun in a convent-seminary on the outskirts of Damascus was terrified at the prospect of the Sunni rebels taking over the country. There were widespread rumours that Idlib and other areas adjoining Turkiye were under the control of rebel forces. \"It will be only a matter of time before they enter Damascus and take over the country,\u2019\u2019 said Agastha, a Catholic nun. \"We will probably all be shot dead as kafirs,\u2019\u2019 she predicted. This was before 2011, when the fighting really started and the civil war was in full force. She was also surprised that the \"Christian nations like the US and Europeans do not understand our plight and the threat to our church.\u2019\u2019 Sister Agastha was unaware of geo-politics and strategic interests of nations that made for strange bedfellows. Peaceful takeover of Damascus So far, the main rebel group led by Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), has acted responsibly. He has instructed his fighters not to shoot at civilians, ensure that public property is not damaged and assured minority Christians, Alawites, and Druze that they will not be harmed. However, considering that the rebel fighters are made up of diverse groups with different ideologies, the fear that radical elements will take control is always there. European leaders are aware of this. German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock warned that \u201cthe country must not now fall into the hands of other radicals\u201d. France has also said as much. Meanwhile, the US has begun air strikes across Syria from late Sunday in an effort to get at \"the ISIS leaders, operatives and camps\u2019\u2019, the US Central Command said in a statement. It also warned ``CENTCOM, together with allies and partners in the region, will continue to carry out operations to degrade\u201d ISIS\u2019s capabilities even during what CENTCOM called \u201cthis dynamic period in Syria.\u201d The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria is a dreaded terror group that carried out the most brutal killings and terrorized European capitals. It was at its most powerful during 2015 when it held territory in both Iraq and Syria. By 2017, it lost ground; today it operates in certain pockets in Syria. The US is hoping to neutralise the ISIS and ensure it does not emerge again as the transition process begins in Syria. Israel also bombarded certain areas in Syria to destroy remnants of the regime's chemical factories. The big winner here is Turkey\u2019s strongman Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who had backed the various factions of Sunni rebels ranged against the minority Alawite dynasty. Alawites are a sect of Shias and Erdogan sees himself as one of the most prominent leaders of Sunni Islam, challenging Saudi Arabia\u2019s dominant position. As the keepers of Mecca and Medina, the two holiest shrines of Sunni Islam, Saudi Arabia enjoys a special status among Sunni Muslims. However, despite their rivalry Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, the UAE as well as other Arab sheikdoms were together in their support for the rebel factions. Erdogan has been fighting not just the Asad regime but the Kurds in both his own country and in Syria. He is now in a commanding position as his years of support for the Sunni rebels will give him considerable leverage with the new government, whenever it takes control in Damascus. Syrian Kurds are concentrated in the north-eastern part of the country that borders Turkiye and Iraq. Erdogan has been fighting Kurds in his own country and regards Syrian Kurds too with a great deal of suspicion. The US has backed Syrian Kurds, who, thanks to the civil war and the weakness of the Asad regime, were able to enjoy a certain degree of autonomy. This could be threatened by the next government in Damascus and lead to confrontation between the US and Turkiye. The US has military bases in the Kurdish area of Syria. Erdogan has been fighting the Kurdistan Workers Party or the PKK, in his own country. The PKK has long waged an insurgency for greater political and cultural rights in Turkiye. BY Outlook Web Desk Besides Turkiye, other winners are the US and the West. Asad was backed to the hilt by Russia and his regime would have collapsed much earlier without Russian troops on the ground. President Vladimir Putin\u2019s involvement in Syria gave him a foothold in West Asia and helped Russia to pull far above its weight in the region. Assad had allowed Moscow a naval base in Tartous and an air base in Latakia. Tartous is a large port city in Syria, second only to Latakia. The naval base gave Russia a strategic presence in the region while the airbase had made it easy for Russia to enhance its strike capability. The new government whenever the power transition is done is unlikely to allow Moscow these privileges. With Russian troops busy in the Ukraine front, there was no help forthcoming from Putin. Washington will be delighted by the fact that Russia\u2019s influence in Syria and the region is now vastly diluted. Many in the West are crediting Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s war in Gaza and Lebanon and its face-off-with Iran as the main reason for the collapse of the Asad government. Israeli has broken the back of Hezbollah, killed its leader and decimated its command structure. It is no longer in a position to bolster Asad\u2019s army. The Syrian army collapsed like a house of cards without the help of Russia and Hezbollah to bolster its defences. Despite the bombings regularly carried out by Israel on Syrian targets, Israel had working relations with Asad. Even when the Iranian mission in Damascus was bombed by Israel, Syrian response was muted. Iran is a major loser The fall of Asad is a major blow to Iran and has further eroded its position in the region. The Shia crescent that stretched from Iran to pockets in Iraq, down to Syria and Lebanon has collapsed. Getting any of its earlier proxies reorganized and ready would not be easy. Iran is in all sorts of trouble with an emboldened Israeli Prime Minister ready to take further risks. Netanyahu could well aim at striking Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, considering it destroyed much of the country\u2019s air defence in its retaliatory raid on Iran in October this year. BY Seema Guha India India has always had cordial relations with Syria and the Assad dynasty. It had consistently sided with India on Kashmir, at a time when most Arab countries solidly backed Pakistan. Again, during the government\u2019s scrapping of article 370 in 2019, Damascus said it was India\u2019s internal matter. In 2008, Bashar al-Assad\u2019s visit to India led to signing of agreements in agriculture and IT, underscoring the strong economic ties between the two countries. Foreign Office Consultations between India and Syria were held in Delhi on November 29. At the end of the talks, the MEA in its statement said: ``Both sides also discussed avenues to deepen the bilateral relationship with a special focus on areas like pharmaceuticals, developmental partnership and capacity building. The two sides also exchanged perspectives on important regional and global issues of mutual interest.\u2019\u2019 All this will for the moment be in limbo. Like other countries, New Delhi is watching developments there. However Indian investments in. \"We are monitoring the situation in Syria in the light of on-going developments. We underline the need for all parties to work towards preserving the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria. We advocate a peaceful and inclusive Syrian-led political process respecting the interests and aspirations of all sections of Syrian society. Our Embassy in Damascus is in contact with the Indian community, for their safety and security\u2019\u2019 the MEA said in a statement on Sunday.",

                    "description": "The allegation comes a day after Opposition leader Peter Dutton criticised the government for being \"weak\" in acting against antisemitism.",
                    "content": "Labor MP Josh Burns has accused Opposition leader Peter Dutton of intervening during a press conference to prevent Liberal senator James Paterson from reading a statement in response to the attack on a Melbourne synagogue . At the time, Burns had lost his voice and was at a joint press conference with Paterson at the Adass Israel Synagogue as a show of unity, following the arson attack on 6 December, which the Australian Federal Police (AFP) have since classified as a terrorist incident . Speaking on ABC Radio National (RN) Breakfast on Tuesday, Burns said Paterson had agreed to read the statement on his behalf due to his inability to speak but alleged Dutton intervened to stop him from doing so. Source: AAP / Joel Carrett \"Unfortunately, right before we got on, Peter Dutton intervened and told James he wasn't allowed to read the statement,\" Burns told RN. \"I wanted to stand out with James and present a united front on this, and Peter Dutton decided it was more important to play partisan games than to allow my words, which I physically couldn't speak, to be read out.\" His statement was instead read by Daniel Aghion, president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ). Burns praised the leadership of the synagogue for being \"heroic and stoic\" in the wake of the attack and said he wasn't interested in \"the partisan games or personal attacks\". AFP establishes antisemitism taskforce after Melbourne synagogue attack Speaking to RN later on Tuesday morning, Paterson responded to Burns' comments, saying he felt \"very sorry that Josh Burns and his community have been abandoned by the Labor Party in the wake of this terrorist attack\". \"But it is not the role of a Liberal frontbencher to act as a spokesman for a Labor MP. One of the many senior Albanese government ministers from Victoria should have been there to speak if Josh was not able to,\" Paterson said. Dutton calls Albanese's antisemitism response 'weak' On Monday, Dutton criticised Labor and Burns for failing to speak up against antisemitism, saying Burns hadn't \"stood up to a weak prime minister\". \"The job for a Labor MP is to stand up to a prime minister who has put the political interests of the Labor Party ahead of our national security interests,\" he said. The Jewish community previously expressed frustration over a perceived lack of action by authorities to stamp out antisemitism, with the ECAJ arguing Australia was at a \"point of crisis\" in a letter sent to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Sunday. Albanese says he personally believes Melbourne synagogue attack was an act of terrorism \"Many in our community now question their future in this country,\" it wrote. \"We ask you, prime minister, to reflect on how this has been allowed to occur.\" Former Liberal treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who is a member of Melbourne's Jewish community, said: \"The government's weakness (in calling out antisemitism) has emboldened those who hate and emboldened those who harm.\" On Sunday, Albanese defended his government's support of the Jewish community, including announcing $32.5 million for community security, banning Nazi salutes and hate symbols, appointing the nation's inaugural antisemitism commissioner and criminalising doxing. 'Jewish people under siege': What we know so far about the 'shocking' synagogue blaze \"This is a time where the country should be looking for national unity, not looking for areas of distinction and difference over every issue,\" Albanese said. \"I would have thought that every Australian would be horrified by what occurred last Friday and would be equally prepared to condemn it and oppose it. It's un-Australian, I've said that. It's designed to create fear in the community, and it should be opposed.\" Writing on social media platform X on Monday, Burns responded to Dutton's comments, saying antisemitism is \"not a political issue for me. It is a lived reality\". \"My priority right now is on supporting our community in the aftermath of a disgraceful antisemitic terror attack.\" Federal antisemitism taskforce On Monday, Albanese called for national unity as he unveiled Special Operation Avalite, led by specialists from the AFP and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. Officers will be given expanded powers to investigate incidents like the arson at the Adass Israel Synagogue, and officers and analysts will be deployed nationally to investigate instances of urging violence against members of groups, advocating terrorism or genocide and using communications services to menace, threaten or harass. 09/12/2024 01:06 Play AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw said: \"Unfortunately, in Australia today, those of Jewish ethnicity or religion are being targeted because of who they are.\" \"This is a crime. This needs to stop.\" \u2014 With additional reporting from the Australian Associated Press",

                    "content": "A dark, horned figure with a goat\u2019s head stands in front of the New Hampshire State House. It\u2019s a holiday display installed by The Satanic Temple \u2014 near the city of Concord\u2019s Nativity scene, according to the city\u2019s Dec. 7 Facebook post. The nationwide group, which has congregations in dozens of states, is recognized as a church by the IRS and describes itself as \u201cthe primary religious Satanic organization in the world.\u201d To prevent potential legal repercussions, Concord has allowed The Satanic Temple to put the monument on Concord\u2019s City Plaza, the city said in a statement. \u201cThe Satanic Temple has been making requests to install its monuments at holiday displays as part (of) a show of unity and religious pluralism,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThroughout the country, The Satanic Temple has both threatened and brought lawsuits under the First Amendment when excluded.\u201d The Satanic Temple was issued a permit that allows it to keep its statue in front of the State House for the month of December, according to Concord. The statue is of Baphomet. \u201cUnder the First Amendment and to avoid litigation, the City needed to choose whether to ban all holiday displays installed by other groups, or otherwise, to allow it,\u201d Concord\u2019s Facebook post said. \u201cAfter reviewing its legal options, the City ultimately decided to continue the policy of allowing unattended displays at City Plaza during this holiday season and to allow the statue,\u201d the statement continued. The Satanic Temple\u2019s co-founder, Lucien Greaves, told McClatchy News in an emailed statement on Dec. 9 that the display \u201cshould be neither controversial nor mystifying to anybody who understands the basic principle of religious liberty.\u201d With glowing yellow eyes, The Satanic Temple\u2019s statue of Baphomet is seen holding lilacs in one hand and an apple in the other, the Concord Monitor reported. Baphomet is a pagan idol associated with the occult. The statue symbolizes \u201ca quest for knowledge, defiance in the face of arbitrary authority, and our commitment to self-determination,\u201d Orpheus Gaur, a minister of The Satanic Temple\u2019s New Hampshire and Vermont chapter, said when the statue was revealed the evening of Dec. 7, according to the newspaper. While speaking at a news conference, standing next to the statue, Gaur said \u201cwe\u2019re here today united in celebration of the principles that define us, as satanists and as advocates for reason, compassion, empathy and justice.\u201d There are some mixed reactions about the monument below the city of Concord\u2019s Facebook post. \u201cFreedom of religion includes all religions,\u201d user Susan Jannene Sherrouse commented. \u201cThis is out of the pit of hell,\u201d another user, Debbie Magee, wrote. Another user, Briana Therrien, commented that the \u201cmission of the Satanic Temple is nothing but positive.\u201d On its website, the group says its mission is to \u201cencourage benevolence and empathy among all people, reject tyrannical authority, advocate practical common sense, oppose injustice and undertake noble pursuits.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if the statue will be allowed to return next year. The Concord City Council is expected to decide whether to issue permits for unattended holiday displays next year, the city said on Facebook. \u201cOur display should not be seen as an insult to the beliefs of others, but rather as a celebration of pluralism demonstrating that while we may have differing opinions, we can all coexist and celebrate the holidays in our various ways,\u201d Greaves told McClatchy News. \u201cConcord was in no real position to approve or disapprove of our display as a judgment for or against our religious beliefs,\u201d Greaves said. \u201cThey can only set parameters for display that are neutral regarding viewpoint.\u201d \u00a92024 The Charlotte Observer.

The nationwide group, which has congregations in dozens of states, is recognized as a church by the IRS and describes itself as \u201cthe primary religious Satanic organization in the world.\u201d To prevent potential legal repercussions, Concord has allowed The Satanic Temple to put the monument on Concord\u2019s City Plaza, the city said in a statement. \u201cThe Satanic Temple has been making requests to install its monuments at holiday displays as part (of) a show of unity and religious pluralism,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThroughout the country, The Satanic Temple has both threatened and brought lawsuits under the First Amendment when excluded.\u201d The Satanic Temple was issued a permit that allows it to keep its statue in front of the State House for the month of December, according to Concord. The statue is of Baphomet. \u201cUnder the First Amendment and to avoid litigation, the City needed to choose whether to ban all holiday displays installed by other groups, or otherwise, to allow it,\u201d Concord\u2019s Facebook post said. \u201cAfter reviewing its legal options, the City ultimately decided to continue the policy of allowing unattended displays at City Plaza during this holiday season and to allow the statue,\u201d the statement continued. The Satanic Temple\u2019s co-founder, Lucien Greaves, told McClatchy News in an emailed statement on Dec. 9 that the display \u201cshould be neither controversial nor mystifying to anybody who understands the basic principle of religious liberty.\u201d With glowing yellow eyes, The Satanic Temple\u2019s statue of Baphomet is seen holding lilacs in one hand and an apple in the other, the Concord Monitor reported. Baphomet is a pagan idol associated with the occult. The statue symbolizes \u201ca quest for knowledge, defiance in the face of arbitrary authority, and our commitment to self-determination,\u201d Orpheus Gaur, a minister of The Satanic Temple\u2019s New Hampshire and Vermont chapter, said when the statue was revealed the evening of Dec. 7, according to the newspaper. While speaking at a news conference, standing next to the statue, Gaur said \u201cwe\u2019re here today united in celebration of the principles that define us, as satanists and as advocates for reason, compassion, empathy and justice.\u201d There are some mixed reactions about the monument below the city of Concord\u2019s Facebook post. \u201cFreedom of religion includes all religions,\u201d user Susan Jannene Sherrouse commented. \u201cThis is out of the pit of hell,\u201d another user, Debbie Magee, wrote. Another user, Briana Therrien, commented that the \u201cmission of the Satanic Temple is nothing but positive.\u201d On its website, the group says its mission is to \u201cencourage benevolence and empathy among all people, reject tyrannical authority, advocate practical common sense, oppose injustice and undertake noble pursuits.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if the statue will be allowed to return next year. The Concord City Council is expected to decide whether to issue permits for unattended holiday displays next year, the city said on Facebook. \u201cOur display should not be seen as an insult to the beliefs of others, but rather as a celebration of pluralism demonstrating that while we may have differing opinions, we can all coexist and celebrate the holidays in our various ways,\u201d Greaves told McClatchy News. \u201cConcord was in no real position to approve or disapprove of our display as a judgment for or against our religious beliefs,\u201d Greaves said. \u201cThey can only set parameters for display that are neutral regarding viewpoint.\u201d",

                    "content": "The results of the 2024 U.S. presidential election rattled the country and sent shockwaves across the world \u2014 or were cause for celebration, depending on who you ask. Is it any surprise then that the Merriam-Webster word of the year is \"polarization\"? \"Polarization means division, but it's a very specific kind of division,\" said Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement. \"Polarization means that we are tending toward the extremes rather than toward the center.\" The election was so divisive, many American voters went to the polls with a feeling that the opposing candidate was an existential threat to the nation. According to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters, about 8 in 10 Kamala Harris voters were very or somewhat concerned that Donald Trump's views \u2014 but not Harris' \u2014 were too extreme, while about 7 in 10 Trump voters felt the same way about Harris \u2014 but not Trump. The Merriam-Webster entry for \"polarization\" reflects scientific and metaphorical definitions. It's most commonly used to mean \"causing strong disagreement between opposing factions or groupings.\" Merriam-Webster, which logs 100 million pageviews a month on its site, chooses its word of the year based on data, tracking a rise in search and usage. Last year's pick was \"authentic.\" This year's comes as large swaths of the U.S. struggle to reach consensus on what is real. \"It's always been important to me that the dictionary serve as a kind of neutral and objective arbiter of meaning for everybody,\" Sokolowski said. \"It's a kind of backstop for meaning in an era of fake news, alternative facts, whatever you want to say about the value of a word's meaning in the culture.\" It's notable that \"polarization\" originated in the early 1800s \u2014 and not during the Renaissance, as did most words with Latin roots about science, Sokolowski said. He called it a \"pretty young word,\" in the scheme of the English language. \"Polarized is a term that brings intensity to another word,\" he continued, most frequently used in the U.S. to describe race relations, politics and ideology. \"The basic job of the dictionary is to tell the truth about words,\" the Merriam-Webster editor continued. \"We've had dictionaries of English for 420 years and it's only been in the last 20 years or so that we've actually known which words people look up.\" \"Polarization\" extends beyond political connotations. It's used to highlight fresh cracks and deep rifts alike in pop culture, tech trends and other industries. All the scrutiny over Taylor Swift's private jet usage? Polarizing. Beef between rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake? Polarizing. The International Olympic Committee's decision to strip American gymnast Jordan Chiles of her bronze medal after the Paris Games? You guessed it: polarizing. Even lighthearted memes \u2014 like those making fun of Australian breakdancer Rachael \"Raygun\" Gunn's performance \u2014 or the proliferation of look-alike contests, or who counts as a nepo baby proved polarizing. Paradoxically though, people tend to see eye to eye on the word itself. Sokolowski cited its frequent use among people across the political spectrum, including commentators on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN. \"It's used by both sides,\" he said, \"and in a little bit ironic twist to the word, it's something that actually everyone agrees on.\" Rounding out Merriam-Webster's top 10 words of 2024: Demure TikToker Jools Lebron's 38-second video describing her workday makeup routine as \"very demure, very mindful\" lit up the summer with memes. The video has been viewed more than 50 million times, yielding \"huge spikes\" in lookups, Sokolowski said, and prompting many to learn it means reserved or modest. Fortnight Taylor Swift's song \"Fortnight,\" featuring rapper Post Malone, undoubtedly spurred many searches for this word, which means two weeks. \"Music can still send people to the dictionary,\" Sokolowski said. Totality The solar eclipse in April inspired awe and much travel. There are tens of millions of people who live along a narrow stretch from Mexico's Pacific coast to eastern Canada, otherwise known as the path of totality, where locals and travelers gazed skyward to see the moon fully blot out the sun. Generally, the word refers to a sum or aggregate amount \u2014 or wholeness. Resonate \"Texts developed by AI have a disproportionate percentage of use of the word 'resonate,'\" Sokolowski said. This may be because the word, which means to affect or appeal to someone in a personal or emotional way, can add gravitas to writing. But, paradoxically, artificial intelligence \"also betrays itself to be a robot because it's using that word too much.\" Allision The word was looked up 60 times more often than usual when, in March, a ship crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. \"When you have one moving object into a fixed object, that's an allision, not a collision. You're showing that one of the two objects struck was not, in fact, in motion,\" Sokolowski said. Weird This summer on the TV news show \"Morning Joe,\" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called Republican leaders \"weird.\" It may have been what launched his national career, landing him as the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Though it's a word that people typically misspell \u2014 is it \"ei\" or \"ie\"? \u2014 and search for that reason, its rise in use was notable, Sokolowski said. Cognitive Whether the word was used to raise questions about President Joe Biden's debate performance or Trump's own age, it cropped up often. It refers to conscious intellectual activity \u2014 such as thinking, reasoning, or remembering. Pander Pander was used widely in political commentary, Sokolowski said. \"Conservative news outlets accused Kamala Harris of pandering to different groups, especially young voters, Black voters, gun rights supporters.\" Whereas Walz said Trump's visit to a McDonald's kitchen pandered to hourly wage workers. It means to say, do, or provide what someone \u2014 such as an audience \u2014 wants or demands even though it is not \"good, proper, reasonable, etc.\" Democracy In 2003, Merriam-Webster decided to make \"democracy\" its first word of the year. Since then, the word \u2014 which, of course, means a form of government in which the people elect representatives to make decisions, policies and laws \u2014 is consistently one of the dictionary's most looked up. \"There's a poignancy to that, that people are checking up on it,\" Sokolowski said. \"Maybe the most hopeful thing that the curiosity of the public shows, is that they're paying attention.\"",

                    "content": "You may have been in groups like this over the past two months. In our adult Sunday school class, exploring the Christmas hymn, \u201cE\u2019en So, Lord Jesus, Quickly Come,\u201d we learned how those words had been composed by Ruth Manz with the music written by her husband as their 3-year-old son lay deadly ill in the hospital. Our conversation turned to our own yearning to see signs of hope and life amid what seems to be an ever-darkening world. A couple of members noted that the tradition in their neighborhood of beautiful Christmas lights has greatly diminished this year, while scary Halloween decorations seem to have exploded. Others talked about anxiety and worry about increased polarization, violence and prevalence of wars of many kinds, both in America and abroad. One father spoke with great eloquence about the despair of his adult daughter who had done volunteer work in the West Bank and her outrage over the silence of American voices about Gaza. Lighting the second Advent candle for peace seemed like a futile gesture. What does one do? We went to the morning worship, where the text for the second Sunday of Advent came from John the Baptist crying in the wilderness for the repentance of sins, calling his audience a \u201cbrood of vipers who have fled from doing anything significant to show their repentance. Don\u2019t justify your behavior by your ancestral and religious heritage! (i.e. your pedigree) No matter your background, the ax is lying at the root of your trees, and those that do not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.\u201d And the people said, \u201cWhat then should we do?\u201d To which John replied, \u201cWhoever has two coats should share with those who have none.\u201d The tax collectors asked him what they should do to repent. He replied, \u201cDon\u2019t use your position to take more from people than the amount owed.\u201d And the soldiers joined in, \u201cWhat should we?\u201d John replied, \u201cDon\u2019t extort money or more from the populace by threats or false accusations!\u201d Our pastor noted how relatively small those acts were in the face of huge problems and crises. But they were concrete steps \u2014 of things to do, and things not to do, depending on your role in society that illustrated how everyone could take responsibility in his or her own sphere of influence by either helping or doing no harm. Bear with me, and let\u2019s play that out in our times. For taxpayers: \u201cDon\u2019t avoid paying taxes just because there are loopholes your lawyers have shaped for you, nor complain about the national debt if you use all of those loopholes.\u201d For corporate executives, boards and billionaires: \u201cDon\u2019t neglect taking responsibility for the communities in which you are located just because Milton Friedman said that profit margins are the only good. Your business and success depend on educated and healthy employees and on infrastructure that carries your goods.\u201d For legislators: \u201cDon\u2019t make rules and policies that favor some and treat others unfairly, no matter how much you need campaign money. Your job is your oath, to protect the Constitution with liberty, justice and freedom for all.\u201d For reporters and newscasters: \u201cTell the truth, not what you wish was or wasn\u2019t true.\u201d For bankers and financiers: \u201cDon\u2019t hide multiple fees, hidden costs and quickly triggered penalties inside your contracts that are too hard to read.\u201d For American patriots: \u201cDon\u2019t complain about illegal immigrants without remembering that many Americans came to this country without the permission of its natives, and especially don\u2019t turn around and exploit them with cheaper wages just because you can.\u201d For drillers, miners, farmers and loggers: \u201cDon\u2019t use or take from God\u2019s creation without cleaning up your mess or ignoring the consequences on the people there.\u201d For health care systems and insurers: \u201cTreat people as people, not as units out of which every possible cost can be squeezed.\u201d For police and law enforcement officers: \u201cDon\u2019t treat people of one race or color differently than you would treat another.\u201d For employers: \u201cThink about how you might hire some people who have the skills but don\u2019t often get the chance to prove so, such as people with disabilities.\u201d For businesses: \u201cDon\u2019t just raise prices if your costs have not gone up, just because inflation gives you cover for doing so.\u201d For people and corporations with great means: \u201cDon\u2019t use your money to persuade others without it seeing the light of day.\u201d For priests and clergy: \u201cDon\u2019t condemn or take the speck out of others\u2019 eyes without taking the logs out of your own.\u201d For all of us: \u201cJust because others do it does not justify your doing so. Don\u2019t drive or walk by just because you think it is someone\u2019s else\u2019s job. Do something, even if it just calling one of the people above.\u201d And for op-ed writers: \u201cMake sure you don\u2019t write about something unless you practice what you preach.\u201d In the Gospel of Luke, it is written that \u201cthe people were filled with great expectation\u201d after John the Baptist\u2019s teaching. Treating people justly and with care, in whatever role we play, indeed might be the best medicine for cynicism, hatred and despair, as well as for a revival of trust in the institutions and systems those roles embody. Won\u2019t somebody do something? We have met that somebody, and it is us. That\u2019s a revival I would like to attend.

According to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters, about 8 in 10 Kamala Harris voters were very or somewhat concerned that Donald Trump\u2019s views \u2014 but not Harris\u2019 \u2014 were too extreme, while about 7 in 10 Trump voters felt the same way about Harris \u2014 but not Trump. The Merriam-Webster entry for \u201cpolarization\u201d reflects scientific and metaphorical definitions.

He called it a \u201cpretty young word,\u201d in the scheme of the English language. \u201cPolarized is a term that brings intensity to another word,\u201d he continued, most frequently used in the U.S. to describe race relations, politics and ideology. \u201cThe basic job of the dictionary is to tell the truth about words,\u201d the Merriam-Webster editor continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve had dictionaries of English for 420 years and it\u2019s only been in the last 20 years or so that we\u2019ve actually known which words people look up.\u201d \u201cPolarization\u201d extends beyond political connotations. It\u2019s used to highlight fresh cracks and deep rifts alike in pop culture, tech trends and other industries. All the scrutiny over Taylor Swift\u2019s private jet usage? Polarizing. Beef between rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake? Polarizing. The International Olympic Committee\u2019s decision to strip American gymnast Jordan Chiles of her bronze medal after the Paris Games? You guessed it: polarizing. Even lighthearted memes \u2014 like those making fun of Australian breakdancer Rachael \u201cRaygun\u201d Gunn\u2019s performance \u2014 or the proliferation of look-alike contests, or who counts as a nepo baby proved polarizing. Paradoxically though, people tend to see eye to eye on the word itself. Sokolowski cited its frequent use among people across the political spectrum, including commentators on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s used by both sides,\u201d he said, \u201cand in a little bit ironic twist to the word, it\u2019s something that actually everyone agrees on.\u201d Demure TikToker Jools Lebron\u2019s 38-second video describing her workday makeup routine as \u201cvery demure, very mindful\u201d lit up the summer with memes. The video has been viewed more than 50 million times, yielding \u201chuge spikes\u201d in lookups, Sokolowski said, and prompting many to learn it means reserved or modest. Fortnight Taylor Swift\u2019s song \u201cFortnight,\u201d featuring rapper Post Malone, undoubtedly spurred many searches for this word, which means two weeks. \u201cMusic can still send people to the dictionary,\u201d Sokolowski said. Totality The solar eclipse in April inspired awe and much travel. There are tens of millions of people who live along a narrow stretch from Mexico\u2019s Pacific coast to eastern Canada, otherwise known as the path of totality, where locals and travelers gazed skyward to see the moon fully blot out the sun. Generally, the word refers to a sum or aggregate amount \u2014 or wholeness. Resonate \u201cTexts developed by AI have a disproportionate percentage of use of the word \u2018resonate,\u2019\u201d Sokolowski said. This may be because the word, which means to affect or appeal to someone in a personal or emotional way, can add gravitas to writing. But, paradoxically, artificial intelligence \u201calso betrays itself to be a robot because it\u2019s using that word too much.\u201d Allision The word was looked up 60 times more often than usual when, in March, a ship crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. \u201cWhen you have one moving object into a fixed object, that\u2019s an allision, not a collision. You\u2019re showing that one of the two objects struck was not, in fact, in motion,\u201d Sokolowski said. Weird This summer on the TV news show \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called Republican leaders \u201cweird.\u201d It may have been what launched his national career, landing him as the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Though it\u2019s a word that people typically misspell \u2014 is it \u201cei\u201d or \u201cie\u201d? \u2014 and search for that reason, its rise in use was notable, Sokolowski said. Cognitive Whether the word was used to raise questions about President Joe Biden\u2019s debate performance or Trump\u2019s own age, it cropped up often. It refers to conscious intellectual activity \u2014 such as thinking, reasoning, or remembering. Pander Pander was used widely in political commentary, Sokolowski said. \u201cConservative news outlets accused Kamala Harris of pandering to different groups, especially young voters, Black voters, gun rights supporters.\u201d Whereas Walz said Trump\u2019s visit to a McDonald\u2019s kitchen pandered to hourly wage workers. It means to say, do, or provide what someone \u2014 such as an audience \u2014 wants or demands even though it is not \u201cgood, proper, reasonable, etc.\u201d Democracy In 2003, Merriam-Webster decided to make \u201cdemocracy\u201d its first word of the year. Since then, the word \u2014 which, of course, means a form of government in which the people elect representatives to make decisions, policies and laws \u2014 is consistently one of the dictionary\u2019s most looked up. \u201cThere\u2019s a poignancy to that, that people are checking up on it,\u201d Sokolowski said. \u201cMaybe the most hopeful thing that the curiosity of the public shows, is that they\u2019re paying attention.\u201d",

(Photo by Elsa/Getty Images) (Getty) \"It's always been important to me that the dictionary serve as a kind of neutral and objective arbiter of meaning for everybody,\" Sokolowski said. \"It's a kind of backstop for meaning in an era of fake news, alternative facts, whatever you want to say about the value of a word's meaning in the culture.\" It's notable that \"polarisation\" originated in the early 1800s \u2014 and not during the Renaissance, as did most words with Latin roots about science, Sokolowski said. He called it a \"pretty young word,\" in the scheme of the English language. \"Polarised is a term that brings intensity to another word,\" he continued, most frequently used in the US to describe race relations, politics and ideology. \"Polarization\" extends beyond political connotations. It's used to highlight fresh cracks and deep rifts alike in pop culture, tech trends and other industries. READ MORE: Noticed the cicadas are louder this year? There's a few reasons why Taylor Swift's use of a private jet this year deeply divided opinion among some pop fans. (AP) All the scrutiny over Taylor Swift's private jet usage? Polarising. Beef between rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake? Polarising. The International Olympic Committee's decision to strip American gymnast Jordan Chiles of her bronze medal after the Paris Games? You guessed it: polarising. Even lighthearted memes \u2014 like those making fun of Australian breakdancer Rachael \"Raygun\" Gunn's performance \u2014 or the proliferation of look-alike contests, or who counts as a nepo baby proved polarizing. Rounding out Merriam-Webster's top 10 words of this year: Demure TikToker Jools Lebron's 38-second video describing her workday makeup routine as \"very demure , very mindful\" lit up the mid year with memes. Fortnight Taylor Swift's song Fortnight, featuring rapper Post Malone, undoubtedly spurred many searches for this word, which means two weeks. The April eclipse over North America drove search for the world \"Totality\". (AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko) (AP) Totality The solar eclipse in April inspired awe and much travel. There are tens of millions of people who live along a narrow stretch from Mexico's Pacific coast to eastern Canada, otherwise known as the path of totality, where locals and travelers gazed skyward to see the moon fully blot out the sun. Resonate \"Texts developed by AI have a disproportionate percentage of use of the word 'resonate,'\" Sokolowski said. This may be because the word, which means to affect or appeal to someone in a personal or emotional way, can add gravitas to writing. Allision The word was looked up 60 times more often than usual when, in March, a ship crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in the eastern US. Weird On the TV news show Morning Joe , Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called Republican leaders \"weird.\" It may have been what launched his national career, landing him as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee. Cognitive Whether the word was used to raise questions about PUS resident Joe Biden's debate performance or Trump's own age, it cropped up often. It refers to conscious intellectual activity \u2014 such as thinking, reasoning, or remembering. Pander Pander was used widely in political commentary, Sokolowski said. It means to say, do, or provide what someone \u2014 such as an audience \u2014 wants or demands even though it is not \"good, proper, reasonable, etc.\" Democracy In 2003, Merriam-Webster decided to make \"democracy\" its first word of the year. Since then, the word \u2014 which, of course, means a form of government in which the people elect representatives to make decisions, policies and laws \u2014 is consistently one of the dictionary's most looked up.

The legislation sponsored by state Attorney General Rob Bonta is necessary to bolster safety for children online, supporters say, but industry officials vow to fight the measure and others like it under the First Amendment. Warning labels for social media gained swift bipartisan support from dozens of attorneys general, including Bonta, after U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called on Congress to establish the requirements earlier this year, saying social media is a contributing factor in the mental health crisis among young people. \u201cThese companies know the harmful impact their products can have on our children, and they refuse to take meaningful steps to make them safer,\u201d Bonta said at a news conference Monday. \u201cTime is up.

Up to 95% of youth ages 13 to 17 say they use a social media platform, and more than a third say that they use social media \u201calmost constantly,\u201d according to 2022 data from the Pew Research Center. Parents\u2019 concerns prompted Australia to pass the world\u2019s first law banning social media for children under 16 in November. \u201cThe promise of social media, although real, has turned into a situation where they\u2019re turning our children\u2019s attention into a commodity,\u201d Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, who authored the California bill, said Monday. \u201cThe attention economy is using our children and their well-being to make money for these California companies.\u201d Lawmakers instead should focus on online safety education and mental health resources, not warning label bills that are \u201cconstitutionally unsound,\u201d said Todd O\u2019Boyle, a vice president of the tech industry policy group Chamber of Progress. \u201cWe strongly suspect that the courts will set them aside as compelled speech,\u201d O\u2019Boyle told The Associated Press.

                    "content": "By TRA\u0302N NGUYE\u0302\u0303N SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California, home to some of the largest technology companies in the world, would be the first U.S. state to require mental health warning labels on social media sites if lawmakers pass a bill introduced Monday. The legislation sponsored by state Attorney General Rob Bonta is necessary to bolster safety for children online, supporters say, but industry officials vow to fight the measure and others like it under the First Amendment. Warning labels for social media gained swift bipartisan support from dozens of attorneys general, including Bonta, after U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called on Congress to establish the requirements earlier this year, saying social media is a contributing factor in the mental health crisis among young people. \u201cThese companies know the harmful impact their products can have on our children, and they refuse to take meaningful steps to make them safer,\u201d Bonta said at a news conference Monday. \u201cTime is up. It\u2019s time we stepped in and demanded change.\u201d State officials haven\u2019t provided details on the bill, but Bonta said the warning labels could pop up once weekly. Up to 95% of youth ages 13 to 17 say they use a social media platform, and more than a third say that they use social media \u201calmost constantly,\u201d according to 2022 data from the Pew Research Center. Parents\u2019 concerns prompted Australia to pass the world\u2019s first law banning social media for children under 16 in November. \u201cThe promise of social media, although real, has turned into a situation where they\u2019re turning our children\u2019s attention into a commodity,\u201d Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, who authored the California bill, said Monday. \u201cThe attention economy is using our children and their well-being to make money for these California companies.\u201d Lawmakers instead should focus on online safety education and mental health resources, not warning label bills that are \u201cconstitutionally unsound,\u201d said Todd O\u2019Boyle, a vice president of the tech industry policy group Chamber of Progress. \u201cWe strongly suspect that the courts will set them aside as compelled speech,\u201d O\u2019Boyle told The Associated Press. Victoria Hinks\u2019 16-year-old daughter, Alexandra, died by suicide four months ago after being \u201cled down dark rabbit holes\u201d on social media that glamorized eating disorders and self-harm. Hinks said the labels would help protect children from companies that turn a blind eye to the harm caused to children\u2019s mental health when they become addicted to social media platforms. \u201cThere\u2019s not a bone in my body that doubts social media played a role in leading her to that final, irreversible decision,\u201d Hinks said. \u201cThis could be your story.\u201d Related Articles National News | Biden creates Native American boarding school national monument to mark era of forced assimilation National News | How should the opioid settlements be spent?

California in the past decade has positioned itself as a leader in regulating and fighting the tech industry to bolster online safety for children. The state was the first in 2022 to bar online platforms from using users\u2019 personal information in ways that could harm children. It was one of the states that sued Meta in 2023 and TikTok in October for deliberately designing addictive features that keep kids hooked on their platforms. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, also signed several bills in September to help curb the effects of social media on children, including one to prohibit social media platforms from knowingly providing addictive feeds to children without parental consent and one to limit or ban students from using smartphones on school campus. Federal lawmakers have held hearings on child online safety and legislation is in the works to force companies to take reasonable steps to prevent harm. The legislation has the support of X owner Elon Musk and the President-elect\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr . Still, the last federal law aimed at protecting children online was enacted in 1998, six years before Facebook\u2019s founding.",

                    "content": "The Golden Globes unveiled nominations this morning, offering a blend of surprising choices and unexpected omissions that could reshape the awards landscape. With the Oscars nomination voting period just weeks away, the Globes voters have once again asserted themselves as a momentum driver, and indicator of what might follow in Hollywood\u2019s most glamorous season. Jacques Audiard\u2019s Spanish-language musical \u201cEmilia Pe\u0301rez\u201d emerged as the morning\u2019s biggest story, garnering an impressive 10 noms. This feat not only sets a new Golden Globes record for a comedy or musical film, surpassing \u201cCabaret\u201d (1972) and \u201cBarbie\u201d (2023) which shared the previous record with nine; but also helped Netflix lead the way for all studios with 12 mentions for film. Most importantly, it cemented \u201cEmilia\u2019s\u201d status as one of the year\u2019s frontrunners for the best picture statuette. Adding to the intrigue, these announcements coincide with a particularly frenzied moment in the season. Today marks the deadline for Critics Choice Awards ballots, while Oscar shortlist voting begins in 10 categories, including documentary feature, international feature, sound, visual effects and more. Meanwhile, SAG Awards voting kicks off next week, on Dec. 16, further intensifying the race. On the small screen, the Golden Globes nominations reveal an industry in transition. Again, Netflix had a standout day, racking up seven series noms across its programming slate. Leading the charge were dramas \u201cThe Diplomat\u201d and \u201cSquid Game,\u201d comedies \u201cThe Gentlemen\u201d and \u201cNobody Wants This,\u201d and limited series \u201cBaby Reindeer,\u201d \u201cMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story,\u201d and \u201cRipley.\u201d However, FX\u2019s \u201cThe Bear\u201d claimed the top spot for all shows with five mentions, keeping up its status as a critical darling. The culinary dramedy has now secured its third consecutive nom, solidifying its place in awards history. Hulu\u2019s \u201cOnly Murders in the Building,\u201d another perennial favorite, also fared well (minus the Meryl Streep snub), continuing its streak of recognition for its sharp writing and ensemble performances. The nominations raise pressing questions about how these picks will influence the Oscar race. Can \u201cEmilia Pe\u0301rez\u201d sustain its momentum in a more traditional Academy landscape? Will Netflix maintain its dominance as a platform capable of excelling in drama, comedy, and limited series? And what does the overwhelming success of \u201cThe Bear\u201d say about the growing embrace of hybrid genres in television? Below, we dive into 15 takeaways and pivotal questions from this year\u2019s Golden Globes nominations. Variety parent company PMC owns Dick Clark Prods. in a joint venture with Eldridge Brady Corbet\u2019s sweeping historical epic \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d and Edward Berger\u2019s religious thriller \u201cConclave\u201d emerged as major players, earning seven and six Globe nominations respectively, trailing only the musical \u201cEmilia Pe\u0301rez.\u201d Both films have been considered serious contenders for the Academy\u2019s top prize, based on industry buzz and glowing reviews. Focus Features, eyeing the first best picture win for the studio, is banking on the power of the preferential ballot, in addition to possible triumphs for drama actor Ralph Fiennes, and screenplay for Peter Straughan. Regarding \u201cBrutalist,\u201d acquired by A24 after its Venice premiere, it has been considered a bonafide contender in multiple categories, including directing, actor for Adrien Brody, and numerous artisan awards. Brody\u2019s nom comes 22 years after his Oscar win for \u201cThe Pianist,\u201d and he also won big with New York Film Critics. However, the film\u2019s trajectory has seemed to echo the 2002 awards race when \u201cPianist\u201d pulled off key upsets in directing (Roman Polanski) and adapted screenplay (Ronald Harwood), losing best picture to another musical \u201cChicago.\u201d Could \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d duplicate a similar evening, if the Academy ends up going for \u201cEmilia Pe\u0301rez\u201d or \u201cWicked?\u201d History offers no guarantees. On the drama side, a Globe win for best picture doesn\u2019t always translate to Oscar success. Films like \u201c1917,\u201d \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\u201d \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d \u201cThe Social Network\u201d and \u201cBabel\u201d claimed the Globe but ultimately lost the Oscar\u2019s top prize to \u201cParasite,\u201d \u201cThe Shape of Water,\u201d \u201cSpotlight,\u201d \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and \u201cThe Departed.\u201d Noteworthy is the inclusion of James Mangold\u2019s \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d in drama, which could see its lead actor nominee Timothee Chalamet emerge victorious. Also, \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d had a ho-hum showing, which came with only two mentions (one of which is ineligible ), and a head-scratching omission from the box office category. The road for Denis Villeneuve\u2019s masterful sci-fi epic is looking a bit grim. The day after Amazon MGM Studios\u2019 \u201cNickel Boys\u201d from RaMell Ross and Paramount Pictures\u2019 \u201cSeptember 5\u201d from Tim Fehlbaum tied at the L.A. Film Critics Awards for best editing , the pair landed in the best picture (drama) category, but as the film\u2019s sole nominees. Only seven films in history have been nominated for just one Golden Globe for best picture (drama): \u201cThe Great Debaters\u201d (2007), \u201cLa Bamba\u201d (1987), \u201cIn Cold Blood (1967), \u201cThe Professionals\u201d (1966), \u201cThe Chalk Garden\u201d (1964), \u201cThe Great Escape\u201d (1963) and \u201cThe Inspector\u201d (1962). Coincidentally, none of them translated to an Oscar nom for best picture. In addition to their surprise inclusions, it\u2019s also interesting to see which films they pushed out, including A24\u2019s prison drama \u201cSing Sing\u201d (which landed a sole nod for Colman Domingo) and Bleecker Street\u2019s British character study \u201cHard Truths\u201d (which was unfortunately shut out). So what does that mean for \u201cNickel Boys\u201d and \u201cSeptember 5?\u201d Let\u2019s see how they continue to perform. Between Sean Baker\u2019s poignant indie Palme d\u2019Or winner \u201cAnora,\u201d which recently topped the L.A. Film Critics Association , Jacques Audiard\u2019s dazzling nomination leader \u201cEmilia Pe\u0301rez,\u201d and Jon M. Chu\u2019s beloved blockbuster musical \u201cWicked,\u201d three of the presumed frontrunners for the Oscar best picture race hail from the comedy/musical side of the Globes. This year\u2019s lineup suggests a resurgence for the genres, but the big question remains: Which film can seal the deal for its studio and ultimately cross the finish line at the Oscars? It\u2019s worth remembering that success in the comedy/musical category at the Globes doesn\u2019t always translate to Oscar glory. In recent years, notable examples include \u201cThe Banshees of Inisherin,\u201d which triumphed at the Globes only to lose the best picture Oscar to \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d (2022). Similarly, \u201cThe Grand Budapest Hotel\u201d charmed its way to a win, only to watch \u201cBirdman\u201d (2014) dominate the Oscars ceremony. But one thing\u2019s for certain: If the Globes producers are looking to ensure maximum audience engagement, they\u2019d be wise to save the comedy/musical categories for the final act of the show. This year\u2019s lineup features all the heavyweights and crowd-pleasers that will keep viewers glued to their screens. There\u2019s been a growing consensus the race for best actress is the most competitive, with an embarrassment of riches. The nominees include Pamela Anderson for \u201cThe Last Showgirl,\u201d Angelina Jolie for \u201cMaria,\u201d Nicole Kidman for \u201cBabygirl,\u201d Tilda Swinton for \u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d Fernanda Torres for \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d and Kate Winslet for \u201cLee.\u201d Each talented performer brings a unique and compelling portrayal to the table, only adding to the fierce competition at hand. Among the nominees, Torres stands out as the only actress whose film also earned another mention, landing a spot in the Non-English Language category. Does the dual recognition make her the frontrunner for this prize? Multiple industry insiders and voter conversations suggest she\u2019s a favorite among members, which could solidify her position as a leading contender, which could help her in her awards prospects. But while Torres may have the edge, Kidman and Jolie\u2019s portrayals have also garnered significant support. For Anderson and Swinton, the nominations provide a much-needed jolt of momentum. Both actresses have faced somewhat muted awards buzz leading up to nominations. And then there\u2019s Winslet, whose double nom \u2014 including her nod for the miniseries \u201cThe Regime\u201d \u2014 adds an intriguing layer. The last time Winslet landed two Globe noms was in 2008 when she went on to win for both \u201cRevolutionary Road\u201d and \u201cThe Reader.\u201d Could voters throw one her way? One of the more surprising omissions from this year\u2019s Globes was the snub for Jon M. Chu in the directing category for Universal\u2019s \u201cWicked,\u201d which prompted a flurry of social media declarations: \u201cIt\u2019s over\u201d for the film\u2019s directing and best picture chances. Not so fast, Ozians. History reminds us that a Globe snub doesn\u2019t necessarily spell doom. Five films have gone on to win the Oscar for best picture despite their directors missing out on Globes: \u201cCODA\u201d (2021), \u201cCrash\u201d (2005), \u201cDriving Miss Daisy\u201d (1989), \u201cChariots of Fire\u201d (1981) and \u201cThe Sting\u201d (1973). And in the rare but not impossible case of a director missing the Globe nod and still clinching the Oscar, there are two examples: Roman Polanski for \u201cThe Pianist\u201d (2002) and George Roy Hill for \u201cThe Sting.\u201d While not unprecedented, Chu\u2019s omission raises the stakes for \u201cWicked\u201d as the season continues to heat up. The Directors Guild of America noms, which come in January, will be key in determining whether the film\u2019s directorial vision can still carve out its path to Oscar night glory. Also noteworthy, sometimes \u201coverperforming\u201d can be a bad thing in the grand scheme of Oscar campaigning. Just ask \u201cBarbie\u201d following its nine Globe noms, and record-breaking 18 CCA mentions last year. For now, it\u2019s still anyone\u2019s game. India is the new France, at least in the Oscar international feature world. After years of contentious selections \u2014 most notably not choosing \u201cAnatomy of a Fall\u201d over \u201cThe Taste of Things\u201d last year \u2014 France appears to have finally realigned its strategy with Jacques Audiard\u2019s \u201cEmilia Pe\u0301rez,\u201d a choice vindicated by its 10 noms. In contrast, India\u2019s choice to bypass Payal Kapadia\u2019s Cannes Grand Prix winner, \u201cAll We Imagine as Light\u201d in favor of \u201cLucky Ladies,\u201d turned some heads. Many believe that Kapadia\u2019s film possesses the thematic depth and cinematic artistry to be a true challenger to \u201cEmilia.\u201d Despite not being India\u2019s official entry, \u201cAll We Imagine\u201d is gaining traction in the U.S. Securing distribution through Janus Films and Sideshow \u2014 the team behind the best picture-nominated \u201cDrive My Car\u201d \u2014 Kapadia\u2019s film is poised for a robust awards campaign. Its recent victories in the Foreign Language categories at both the L.A. Film Critics and Gotham awards show strength. Additionally, dual mentions for non-English language and director amplify its visibility and credibility in the crowded awards landscape. This could mimic the road for \u201cAnatomy\u201d last year, which went on to receive five Oscar nominations, winning one for original screenplay. BAFTA will be vital. Searchlight Pictures\u2019 \u201cA Real Pain,\u201d written, directed, and produced by Jesse Eisenberg, had a strong showing at the nominations, earning nods for picture (comedy), supporting actor (Kieran Culkin), actor and screenplay (both for Eisenberg). Thus far, Glen Powell\u2019s charismatic turn in \u201cHit Man,\u201d Jesse Plemons\u2019 Cannes-winning performance in \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d and the double-nominated Sebastian Stan for \u201cA Different Man\u201d have been assumed to be the frontrunners. However, Eisenberg\u2019s momentum, bolstered by \u201cA Real Pain\u2019s\u201d screenplay win from L.A. Film Critics, and Culkin\u2019s current steamroll with other critics groups, suggests he shouldn\u2019t be counted out. If Eisenberg pulls off a Globe victory, he could join an elite club of actors who directed themselves to Oscar nominations, including Bradley Cooper (\u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d \u201cMaestro\u201d), Denzel Washington (\u201cFences\u201d), and Clint Eastwood (\u201cMillion Dollar Baby,\u201d \u201cUnforgiven\u201d). Eisenberg, a former Oscar nominee for \u201cThe Social Network\u201d (2010), has proven he\u2019s capable of delivering compelling performances, ones the Academy can embrace, and his work in \u201cA Real Pain\u201d is no exception. Sebastian Stan has doubled his awards season presence, earning two lead noms \u2014 one for his daring portrayal of Donald J. Trump in the drama \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and the other for his tender turn as a man grappling with neurofibromatosis in the dramedy \u201cA Different Man.\u201d This rare feat places Stan among an elite group of performers. The last actor to achieve dual lead nominations in both drama and comedy categories was Julianne Moore in 2014, winning for \u201cStill Alice\u201d while also nominated for \u201cMaps to the Stars.\u201d Among male actors, he joins the ranks of Ryan Gosling (2011\u2019s \u201cThe Ides of March\u201d and \u201cCrazy, Stupid, Love\u201d), Tom Hanks (1993\u2019s \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d and \u201cSleepless in Seattle\u201d), and Dustin Hoffman (1970\u2019s \u201cMidnight Cowboy\u201d and \u201cJohn and Mary\u201d). Notably, Gosling is the only one of these not to secure an eventual Oscar nomination, underscoring the significance of this accomplishment. Stan\u2019s awards trajectory is further bolstered by his co-star Jeremy Strong, who earned a supporting actor nom for \u201cApprentice.\u201d This added co-star presence could strengthen Stan\u2019s chances with Academy voters, particularly in a year with a comparatively weaker lead actor field. However, the road is not without challenges. Vote-splitting between his two standout performances could dilute his Oscar chances, and \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d despite its acclaim, faces polarizing reactions due to the cultural baggage of its subject. On the other hand, \u201cA Different Man,\u201d which won best feature at the Gothams, may present a more accessible option for voters. Perhaps there\u2019s room for our favorite \u201cWinter Soldier?\u201d The Globes acting nods delivered a mix of triumphant milestones and notable snubs with diversity and representation. Latino actors had one of their strongest showings in decades, particularly Afro-Latinos. Colman Domingo earned a nom for his powerful role in \u201cSing Sing,\u201d while Zoe Saldan\u0303a, a standout in \u201cEmilia Pe\u0301rez,\u201d was joined by her co-star Selena Gomez, who scored a second mention for TV comedy actress in \u201cOnly Murders in the Building.\u201d Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres, nominated for \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d follows in the footsteps of her mother, Fernanda Montenegro, who was recognized in 1998 for \u201cCentral Station.\u201d On the TV side, Liza Colo\u0301n-Zayas (\u201cThe Bear\u201d), Sofi\u0301a Vergara (\u201cGriselda\u201d), and Diego Luna (\u201cLa Ma\u0301quina\u201d) also received deserved noms. Notable: \u201cAlien: Romulus,\u201d directed by Uruguayan auteur Fede A\u0301lvarez, earned a spot for box office and cinematic achievement. However, Nicholas Alexander Chavez, the sole Latino main actor in \u201cMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story,\u201d was snubbed, even as his co-stars Javier Bardem and Cooper Koch had their names called. Black actors were highlighted on the film side with Denzel Washington (\u201cGladiator II\u201d), Zendaya (\u201cChallengers\u201d), Cynthia Erivo (\u201cWicked\u201d), along with Saldan\u0303a and Domingo. Yet glaring omissions were felt, with Danielle Deadwyler (\u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d), Clarence Maclin (\u201cSing Sing\u201d), Marianne Jean-Baptiste (\u201cHard Truths\u201d), and RaMell Ross (director of \u201cNickel Boys\u201d) left out. On the TV side, Jamie Foxx\u2019s comedy special earned a nod, as did Quinta Brunson (\u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d), Ayo Edebiri (\u201cThe Bear\u201d), and Donald Glover (\u201cMr. and Mrs. Smith\u201d). AAPI talent shone on the television side, with Ali Wong, Ramy Youssef, Tadanobu Asano, Hiroyuki Sanada, Anna Sawai, and Maya Erskine all landing mentions. Meanwhile, hopes are high for Indigenous performer Kali Reis to follow in Lily Gladstone\u2019s historic win last year (\u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d), with her nom for HBO/Max\u2019s \u201cTrue Detective: Night Country.\u201d Karla Sofi\u0301a Gasco\u0301n hit a significant milestone for the LGBTQ community with her nom for \u201cEmilia Pe\u0301rez, \u201d becoming the first out trans performer to be nominated in a top film acting category (\u201cPose\u201d actor Michaela Jae\u0301 Rodriguez won the TV actress comedy in 2022). Non-binary actor Emma D\u2019Arcy was among the TV nominees for \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d in lead drama actress, along with other openly gay actors such as Jodie Foster and Kali Reis (\u201cTrue Detective: Night Country\u201d) and Richard Gadd (\u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d). That also included film nominees such as Domingo and Erivo. Coralie Fargeat\u2019s bold and visceral \u201cThe Substance\u201d made a major splash with five Globe noms, including best picture (Comedy), directing, screenplay, actress (Demi Moore) and supporting actress (Margaret Qualley). A significant moment for the often-overlooked horror genre, but the bigger question remains: Will the Academy embrace this daring, genre-defying choice? The film, which won the screenplay prize at Cannes, has garnered critical acclaim for its audacious storytelling, particularly its jaw-dropping, chaotic third act. International voters could be the group to rally behind its innovative approach, but convincing Hollywood\u2019s more conservative (snobby?) voting body to recognize a horror film is a perennial challenge. Still, the film\u2019s momentum is undeniable. A fascinating footnote: This marks Demi Moore\u2019s first Globe nomination on the film side since \u201cGhost\u201d (1990) \u2014 when she was nominated alongside her \u201cSubstance\u201d co-star Qualley\u2019s mother, Andie MacDowell (\u201cGreen Card\u201d), before Qualley was even born. A full-circle moment. The first season of Netflix\u2019s \u201cSquid Game\u201d landed three Globe noms in 2021, including drama series. Now, it\u2019s been three years since the show, which became the most-watched series in Netflix history, and voters gave it a sole nom for drama series. But don\u2019t read too much into that. Netflix made Season 2 available to Globe voters (Season 2 doesn\u2019t release until Dec. 26), however, this is different from late-breaking films which have fall festivals and other avenues to pick up steam. The TV awards calendar blends overlapping Emmy seasons. It\u2019s also difficult for a show to take such a long hiatus, and return for more (i.e., \u201cAtlanta\u201d). Nonetheless, \u201cSquid Game\u201d is back in the conversation, and hoping for another dance at the Emmys (especially now that \u201cSuccession\u201d is over). While broadcast networks broke their way back into the Emmy race earlier this year with ABC and CBS picking up 38 nods each, that wasn\u2019t the outcome for Globe nominations. ABC\u2019s hit mockumentary \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d is the sole nominated broadcast show, picking up two noms for TV comedy series and lead actress Quinta Brunson. The rest of the field was dominated by streamers (and a little bit of cable). After \u201cAbbott\u201d won the top prize for the first season, it was de-throned by \u201cThe Bear\u201d last year. In the middle of an amazing fourth season, could the critically acclaimed comedy make another trip to the Beverly Hilton ballroom stage? Netflix has long sought a dominant player in the TV comedy awards race, with past contenders like \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\u201d \u201cMaster of None\u201d and \u201cWednesday\u201d earning acclaim but falling short of the top prize. Now, the streamer appears poised for a breakthrough with the rom-com series Nobody Wants This. Starring Kristen Bell and Adam Brody, the show centers on the unconventional relationship between an agnostic woman and a rogue rabbi, striking a chord with audiences and critics alike. As a result, the series landed three Globe noms \u2014 for Comedy Series, Actor, and Actress \u2014 mirroring the same showing at the Critics Choice TV Awards nominations last week. With a 94% score on Rotten Tomatoes and a growing fanbase, \u201cNobody Wants This\u201d could give Netflix the chance to walk away with its second Globe win for a comedy series after \u201cThe Kominsky Method\u201d in 2019. But one thing\u2019s for certain, this is the streamer\u2019s comedy pony to push for next year\u2019s Emmys and they\u2019re determined to get it there. HBO/Max\u2019s crime drama miniseries \u201cThe Penguin\u201d has solidified its place in this year\u2019s TV awards conversation, earning three noms for Colin Farrell, Cristin Milioti, and limited series and joining its network counterpart \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d among the genre shows recognized. Farrell, a past Globe winner for the film \u201cIn Bruges,\u201d emerges as a formidable contender, potentially challenging Emmy winner Richard Gadd (\u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d). Meanwhile, Milioti\u2019s mention for her standout portrayal positions her as a dark horse in the actress category, where she could upset fellow HBO/Max star Jodie Foster (\u201cTrue Detective: Night Country\u201d). Interestingly, the Globes and Emmys have aligned in this category for the past five years, but history suggests the occasional surprise. Memorable upsets include Patricia Arquette\u2019s (\u201cEscape at Dannemora\u201d) over Regina King (\u201cSeven Seconds\u201d) and Drew Barrymore\u2019s win for \u201cGrey Gardens\u201d over Emmy-winning co-star Jessica Lange. \u201cThe Penguin\u201d could go far. After a historic Emmy loss despite breaking the all-time nomination record for a comedy series, FX\u2019s \u201cThe Bear\u201d leads the Globe nominations for all series with five, including comedy series, and four of its actors. While Season 3 of the FX hit received a more tempered response compared to its earlier seasons, this marks the second major voting body to cast their ballots on this previous outing. The Critics Choice TV Awards only provided a sole mention for supporting comedy actress Liza Colo\u0301n-Zayas. The show\u2019s uneven reception hasn\u2019t stopped its dominance, but the ongoing debate over whether \u201cThe Bear\u201d truly qualifies as a comedy will continue to be a topic going into the next season, surely. The question now is whether Globe voters will double down on their love for \u201cBear,\u201d or pivot to fresher, newer contenders.",

                    "content": "In one very obvious way, 2024 was the biggest year for dance albums in recent memory. While pop music and the whole world beyond was happy (and correct) to claim Charli XCX and Brat , the club kids knew that sonically and temperamentally, the album belonged to us. \u201cI think I\u2019ve had a pretty big impact on popular music; I won\u2019t lie,\u201d Charli told us in March, the same week the name of her then forthcoming and soon to be culture-shaking sixth studio album was announced. \u201cBut it feels weird even saying that in a subtle way in this interview, to be honest. I don\u2019t think it has ever been [my or my collaborators\u2019] intention to transport elements of club or underground music to a wider audience; I think we\u2019ve just been instinctual.\u201d Instinct bore out in outlandishly successful fashion this year, with Brat painting the globe green while giving mainstream music a club-world starter pack that included key bumps, Boiler Room and sunglasses at all times. It\u2019s hard to say definitively if the album sparked a broader general interest dance music, but anyone who did step through the door Charli opened would\u2019ve found a lot to enjoy. Indeed, those in the know understand that in many ways both spotlit and subtle, 2024 contained so much, in so many sounds and colors. There were long-awaited and expectation-smashing follow-ups by genre masters, who used their new music as source material for stunning live shows, shimmering debuts LPs by rising stars and dance mainstays, inventive output from dance-world pillars and more albums by female producers than we can remember ever coming out in as quick succession. In a genre often focused on singles, 2024 exemplified the power and importance of albums as complete artistic statements and dancefloor fuel. These are the 25 best dance albums of 2024, presented alphabetically by artist. The Australian producer released the first album of her decade-plus career in October, with the project\u2019s 13 tracks built for the dancefloor but also contemplating themes well beyond the party. \u201cIt\u2019s felt like dance music has met me in the middle,\u201d Lunoe told us of writing about topics like motherhood, friendship and all varieties of love. \u201cDance music\u2019s had this incredible arc in the last five years, or the last 15 years for sure. But in the last five years we\u2019ve seen a lot more sincerity, a lot more real stories being told in the club space, and it made it easier for me.\u201d The project includes the piano house anthem \u201cReal Love\u201d and the hypnotic \u201cRight Here,\u201d a collaboration with Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs. \u2014 KATIE BAIN \u201cOne thing that hasn\u2019t changed for me from the very beginning is a manic curiosity of seeing what I can make out of sound,\u201d the artist born Dan Snaith said when announcing his sixth studio album as Caribou, October\u2019s Honey . The Canadian producer\u2019s use of AI to alter and feminize his voice on the project was a surprise move that created a lot of buzz and critique, but overall the project is inviting and as its name suggests, sweet. The title track encompasses what Snaith does best, and perhaps bridges his work as Caribou and clubbier Daphni alias, with the earworm song driven by a skittering, buoyant bassline, looped vocals and an infectious beat. \u201cDo Without You\u201d calls back to his biggest tune, 2014\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Do Without You,\u201d and \u201cCome Find Me\u201d at once feels joyous and bittersweet, a distinctly Caribou mood. \u2014 ANA MONROY YGLESIAS With her debut album Sentimental , Turkish-Italian house producer Carlita proved that the buzz around her over the last few years is well deserved. Released on Ninja Tune on Nov. 15, the project channels melancholy, joy and a range of other emotions in layered, immersive soundscapes in which Carlita plays many of the featured instruments, including piano, guitar, bass and cello. \u201cPlanet Blue\u201d with vocalist Cleo Simone and \u201cForever Baby\u201d with Janet Planet of Confidence Man find a home in her energetic sets, while the rest of the album offers a more downtempo \u2014 yet equally compelling \u2014 side of her artistry and musical influences. The opening track \u201cTrouble Symphony,\u201d featuring her mentor DJ Tennis, sets the tone for the sonic journey of the album, while the penultimate track \u201cTime\u201d is a euphoric, transcendent number that\u2019s become a favorite closing track for Carlita and her fans since she debuted it at Coachella 2023. \u2013 A.M.Y. It\u2019s no small feat to pull off a sound that\u2019s simultaneously nostalgic and forward-looking, but Charli XCX \u2019s Brat does it in a seamless, sweaty fashion, creating a hedonistic-yet-heartfelt album that melds the mid aughts party girl vibe with today\u2019s breathless, take-no-prisoners hyperpop. From the sparkling, heart-rending dance-pop of \u201cGirl, So Confusing\u201d to the hypnotic electroclash of \u201cVon Dutch\u201d to indie sleaze bangers like \u201c365\u201d and frenetic, brash anthems like \u201cClub Classics\u201d and \u201cMean Girls,\u201d Brat covers a lot of ground thematically and stylistically, while still feeling like an all-too-brief rush of adrenaline. Charli has always created distinct aural worlds, but this magnum opus feels like the most authentically XCX so far \u2014 and that\u2019s the key (no, not the powder-dusted kind) to Brat \u2019s brilliance. \u2013 JOE LYNCH Every remix album thinks that it\u2019s Totally Different but Also Still spiritually in keeping with its original, but only a precious few are willing to put in the work to make them play as such. Charli XCX could\u2019ve phoned in her sequel set and merely gotten a couple extra weeks of Brat Summer out of it, but instead, she turned her career-defining LP into an entire cinematic universe, with countless side characters expanding their own stories alongside her, and dancefloor action sequences that not even the original set could quite compete with. But it\u2019s not all about size and scope: The Japanese House\u2019s appearance on \u201cApple\u201d helps turn the song into a devastating account of post-breakup alienation and homesickness, while the A.G. Cook-assisted \u201cSo I\u201d becomes such a heartburstingly joyful and vivid tribute to \u201call the good times\u201d with the late SOPHIE that it\u2019s difficult to even think about it without tearing up. \u2014 ANDREW UNTERBERGER Aussie quartet Confidence Man took the classic \u201cwrite drunk, edit sober\u201d adage to heart when creating their third album, 3AM (La La La) . After relocating to London, the group immersed themselves in the city\u2019s queer club scene, ending nights out, they told NME in October, with drunken songwriting sessions. Their unfiltered musings are immortalized across a fun and high-energy collection of U.K.-centric tracks, with the group choosing life on the stadium-sized trance of \u201cSo What,\u201d seeking chemical ecstasy in the drop of \u201cBreakbeat,\u201d and channeling Underworld on the introspective title track. 3AM might stir up hazy memories of your own blurry nights along the way. \u2014 KRYSTAL RODRIGUEZ After his stunning, elegiac 2021 album Promises , a meditative collaboration with legendary jazz saxophonist Pharoah Sanders and the London Symphony Orchestra, Sam Shepherd, the British producer who records as Floating Points, returned to the dancefloor this year with Cascade . Shepherd has spent recent years playing shows with accomplished dance veterans like Four Tet and Dan Snaith (the latter under both his Caribou and Daphni aliases), and their influence shows on Cascade \u2013 both the most intricate and most driving club music Floating Points has made to date. The heady swirl of acid house, jungle and techno is as meticulous and emotive as Promises \u2013 a testament not only to Shepherd\u2019s talent but to his remarkable range. \u2013 ERIC RENNER BROWN Kieran Hebden\u2019s long, winding career as Four Tet has included moments of indie-blog sensationalism and unexpected arena-set command \u2014 but regardless of the size of his profile, his work consistently surprises, spiked with moments that upend dance listeners\u2019 expectations. His twelfth studio album Three is another rock-solid project full of swivels and evolutions, from the twinkling melody arriving on \u201cDaydream Repeat\u201d to the beautiful, morphing dissonance of closer \u201cThree Drums.\u201d As Hebden\u2019s shows get progressively larger (with a standalone set at Los Angeles\u2019 Kia Forum coming in February), Three is also a transmission that, for as big as he\u2019s gotten, his essence remains unchanged. \u2014 JASON LIPSHUTZ \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of biggg mad crazy moments in the last year,\u201d Fred again.. wrote about his then-upcoming album ten days on Instagram back in August, \u201cbut basically all of these are about really very small quiet intimate moments.\u201d Hard to ask for a better summary of the appeal of the massively successful U.K. producer or his new album than that: He makes big, floor-filling club anthems that still feel like they\u2019re being whispered to you by a good friend in the hallway outside. Whether it\u2019s Sampha belting about a startling feeling of closeness experienced with a fellow traveler during a traffic jam on \u201cFear Less\u201d or SOAK sing-speaking about a positive romantic encounter that leaves them stunned and terrified with happiness on \u201cJust Stand There,\u201d the set is a disarmingly emotional and visceral one \u2014 with the DJ behind them approximating all the racing pulses, trembling hands and pounding hearts that denote such life-changingly personal moments. \u2014 A.U. The work of bass music\u2019s new cool kids (and IRL pals) ISOxo and Knock2 has caught the attention of genre titans Skrillex and RL Grime (with the former sharing a photo of ISOxo on his IG and the latter working on several collabs with Knock), and their August collaborative LP 4EVR functions as part of a passing application allowing the duo entry into the genre\u2019s highest echelons. The pair load up the album\u2019s eight tracks with inventive tricks and precise production, building huge, stank-face eliciting walls of music, while softer and more analog tracks like \u201cBlind\u201d provide moments of contemplation (and a second to breathe) amid the delicious chaos. \u2014 K. Bain Speaking to Billboard earlier this year, the British DJ and producer said that he finds listening back to his own music \u201cexcruciating,\u201d likening it to rereading a cringeworthy diary entry from years past. He\u2019s doing himself something of a disservice as In Waves , the second solo LP from The xx member, rewards repeated listens. The sequel to 2015\u2019s masterful debut In Colour skews closer to the dancefloor than his previous work and sees him reuniting with his band members Romy and Oliver Sim for \u201cWaited All Night,\u201d while Robyn stars on the joyous \u201cLife\u201d and other major players including Honey Dijon and The Avalanches make memorable, effective appearances. The wait was well worth it. \u2014 T.S. Euphoria and introspection share the spotlight on John Summit \u2019s debut album Comfort in Chaos , a culmination of his rapid ascent over the last few years. \u201cEat the Bass\u201d delivers the booming tech-house grooves with which the producer broke out, while melodic cuts like \u201cWhere You Are\u201d and \u201cShiver\u201d \u2013 both Top 10 hits on Hot Dance/Electronic Songs \u2013 reveal his softer side, turning longing into dance floor catharsis. The album provides a safe space for experimenting, too, such as on the genre-flipping \u201cGo Back\u201d with Sub Focus and ethereal drum \u2018n\u2019 bass of \u201cpalm of my hands.\u201d A captivating glimpse of the artist behind the party-starting persona, Comfort in Chaos is up for top dance/electronic album at this year\u2019s Billboard Music Awards. \u2014 K.R. If ever there was an argument for taking your time, it\u2019s Justice \u2019s fourth studio album, Hyperdrama. The Grammy-winning duo has never released music on a fast schedule, having only toured four times (and released as many albums) over its 20-year career. But the eight year gap between 2016\u2019s Woman and this year\u2019s 13-track release seemed particularly pronounced. (To be entirely clear, it was also broken up by Justice\u2019s 2018 live album Woman Worldwide and a 2021 solo album from the group\u2019s Gaspard Auge\u0301.) Some fans speculated that the pair had broken up \u2014 but as it turned out the guys were just cooking up a mean, clean, organically-synthesized machine. Hyperdrama feels like taking an intergalactic trip in the spaceship featured on the album\u2019s back sleeve, with the project maneuvering through soft melodies, psychedelic freak-outs and sinister synth lines with compelling exactitude. One second, everything on the record is the analog. The next, everything\u2019s electric. Justice says it took inspiration from some of the modern era\u2019s more eclectic hip-hop records, but truly, the most impressive thing about Hyperdrama is how much it doesn\u2019t really sound like anything or anyone else at all \u2014 event as it carries major vocal collaborations from Tame Impala , Miguel , Thundercat and more big names. \u2014 KAT BEIN How do you follow up an album that swept the Grammys dance categories in 2021? With his third album Timeless , Kaytranada pushes past the pressure by simply continuing doing what he\u2019s always done: producing impeccable grooves and top-notch vibes. The album recreates a club night with a VIP guest list ( Tinashe , PinkPantheress , Anderson .Paak and more), bridging suggestive R&B with disco-steeped grooves and ultra-modern new jack swing. Kaytranada makes room for expansion, too, singing on a track for the first time. So to answer the initial question: He made another Grammy-nominated LP, with the project up for best dance/electronic album at the 2025 awards. \u2014 K.R. The Welsh musician has spent the better part of a decade operating around the edges, her left-field electronica best-suited for intense concentration or relaxation. Dreamstate , then, is Owens\u2019 pop record and was in fact inspired by supporting Depeche Mode on their recent tour and facing the challenge of filling cavernous venues with her sound. Signed to Dh2 \u2013 Dirty Hit\u2019s new dance imprint \u2013 Owens meets this challenge with \u201cLove You Got\u201d and the euphoric \u201cHigher.\u201d With contributions from her label boss (and The 1975 drummer + Charli XCX fiance\u0301) George Daniel, The Chemical Brothers and Bicep , she retains a singular vision and enters a bold new chapter. \u2013 THOMAS SMITH Dance music is often guilty of flattening emotional experience, with innumerable tracks about \u201craging\u201d and \u201cdancing the night away\u201d and all varieties of sexual attraction averting the genre\u2019s metaphorical eyes from the full spectrum of human experience. The opposite is true of LP Giobbi\u2019s second album Dotr , which the producer made while working through the well of grief felt after three people very close to her died in quick succession. That thread of melancholy is woven throughout the 17-track project, with analog violin and piano \u2014 along with the very human voices from Alabama Shakes \u2018 Brittany Howard and Portugal. The Man , among others \u2014 creating sonic and emotional texture, offering moments to mourn to, to dance through the pain to and to celebrate life itself with. \u2014 K. Bain On 3FOR82 , Machinedrum bridges the past and future with introspection and tenderness. The producer built upon some of his earliest unpublished beats, polishing them into forward-facing sonics that are meditative and spectral, like a foggy night drive. Nostalgia also coats the album\u2019s lyrics, crafted in response to a question Machinedrum posed to his vocalists, who include aja monet, Mick Jones and Tinashe : \u201cIf you could visit with your younger self, what would you say to them?\u201d This leads to gruff words of wisdom, musings on the beauty of solitary dancing and sun-after-rain optimism. 3FOR82 encourages reflection, leaving you thinking long after it ends. \u2014 K.R. Peggy Gou committed to an aesthetic on her debut album I Hear You , with the South Korean producer giving all flavors of \u201990s dance \u2014 house, ambient, rave \u2014 and giving them all her spacious, sprinkled in powdered sugar treatment. (She also committed to doing the debut exactly how she wanted, going as far as booking a flight to the Bahamas to convince Lenny Kravitz sing on the steamy \u201cI Believe in Love Again.\u201d) The last 12 months saw Gou playing several of her biggest sets to date while generally jetting around the world playing to giant crowds, with I Hear You functioning as the centerpiece of her ascension. \u2014 K. Bain It a band stays together long enough, most inevitably make an album about the realities of being in said band. 15 years into their run, Ru\u0308fu\u0308s Du Sol got into this self-reflective mode on Inhale/Exhale, the Australian trio\u2019s fifth studio LP. Songs like \u201cPressure\u201d speak directly to the experience of global fame and the expectations that come with. (\u201cYou\u2019ll never break me down,\u201d singer Tyrone Lindqvist advises on the track.) The guys told us they entered group therapy while making the project to clear up old resentments and set healthier patterns, with the result of that fine tuning being 15 tracks that match the lush, moody, often overtly romantic ambience of the group\u2019s entire catalog, but which this time are largely stripped of builds/drops \u2014 finding the guys in what feels a more mature, but still quintessentially Ru\u0308fu\u0308s, phase. \u2014 K. Bain Watch one of dance music\u2019s new-gen stars bloom in real time. After joining the Ninja Tune family in 2023, salute released their debut album , True Magic , a collection of colorful and high-shine songs spanning French touch, house, drum \u2018n\u2019 bass and racing-video-game immersion. The Vienna-born, Manchester-based producer has long emphasized the importance of community, and the LP reflects that through its many and diverse collaborations, from \u201clift off!\u201d with Disclosure to \u201cgo!\u201d with Japanese rapper Nakamura Minami. In search of a mood boost? Look no further. \u2014 K.R. There\u2019s a thin line between the physical pleasure of the dancefloor and actual ecstasis, with Texas-born, Amsterdam-based hard techno producer Sara Landry exploring the places where these sensations meet on her debut album, Spiritual Driveby. Made with serious intention (the call-to-arms opener \u201c396hz\u201d) and also a sense of giddy and unself-serious fun (\u201cPressure\u201d) the album dropped in October through her own Hekate label, functioning as both neural salve for people who like heavy music and an exclamation point on Landry\u2019s breakout year . In 2024, she performed a viral Boiler Room set, sold out every U.S. show she played, secured a choice spot on the 2025 Coachella lineup and generally established her electric presence and pummeling sound in the U.S. and beyond. \u2014 K. Bain In a year partially defined by Brat summer, the ever-enchanting and benevolently aggressive presence of mononymous producer SOPHIE \u2018s influence is vast. The Scottish electronic icon passed away suddenly and tragically in January of 2021 at age 34, and yet the modern dance underground and contemporary pop-charts are mired in the \u201clightning strike\u201d (as Charli XCX sings it on her SOPHIE tribute \u201cSo I\u201d) of her career. She was a majestic maniac in the studio, famously creating mind-bogglingly organic sounds from a digital audio workstation and her sheer force of will. Her DJ sets were loud and challenging, as were productions that helped invent the concept of hyperpop and the Charli XCX we know and love today. Her undeniable talent and in-your-face queerness opened the door for a generation of artists to be themselves, and three years after her death, her brother and close collaborators offered the world one more dose of her genius. Posthumous records are always tricky and divisive. We\u2019ll never know what SOPHIE would have sounded like if she herself had finished it, but the album\u2019s 16 tracks do encompass the many shades of her being. It\u2019s uncomfortable at times and riddled with earworms the next, exploring a myriad of existential concepts in its lyrics and altogether challenging perceptions of what pop music, electronic music and even just straight up music can be. For that gift, and legacy, we are grateful. \u2014 K. Bein This year\u2019s steamy sports blockbuster Challengers was set primarily on tennis courts, but its soundtrack hailed squarely from the dancefloor. Even independent from its narrative accompaniment, the uneasy, adrenaline-stimulating set is a remarkable achievement by sought-after soundtrack duo Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross \u2013 and their best work since creating their landmark score for 2010\u2019s The Social Network . The centerpiece is the pummeling, breakneck-speed title track, but Reznor and Ross flesh out the film\u2019s sonic world with highlights like \u201c\u2018I Know,'\u201d a radiant synth-pop cut; \u201cYeah x10,\u201d which channels the LCD Soundsystem -style dance-punk that dominated the mid-\u201900s era during which Challengers is set; and \u201cL\u2019ouef,\u201d an eerie combination of piano and near-ambient synths that calls to mind The Social Network at its atmospheric best. \u2014 E.R.B. Zedd \u2018s third studio album drips with a feeling of abundance and ambition. John Mayer firing off a guitar solo and singing on the simmering \u201cAutomatic Yes\u201d? Yes! A Jeff Buckley sample melded with Middle Eastern strings on \u201cDream Brother\u2019? Yah! Muse \u2018s Matt Bellamy interpolating \u201cAve Maria\u201d on \u201c1685,\u201d a tribute to Daft Punk as much as it is to god and romance? Heck yeah! The producer threw the kitchen sink at the project, his first LP since 2015\u2019s True Colors , in a way that never sounds overwrought and manages to maintain cohesion as he shuttles between styles, with the album ultimately functioning as a cinematic, soaring statement about where the producer\u2019s head is at, more than a decade after he helped define the EDM era. \u2014 K.

This masterpiece combines advanced technology, striking design, and top-tier performance, celebrating Ducati\u2019s racing heritage.

                    "content": "New Delhi: Ducati has introduced the Panigale V4 Tricolore, a special-edition motorcycle limited to just 1,000 units, created to honor the Italian spirit and Ducati\u2019s heritage. Combining advanced technology, great design, and top-notch track performance, this bike is a true masterpiece for both motorcycle fans and collectors. The Panigale V4 Tricolore was unveiled at Art Basel in Miami Beach, marking a historic year for Ducati, which celebrated a dominant season in motorsports. The company claimed its third straight MotoGP Riders\u2019 and Manufacturers\u2019 Championships, winning 19 out of 20 Grand Prix races. Ducati also triumphed in other categories, securing titles in Superbike, Supersport, Italian Motocross, and historic victories in Japanese and U.S. Superbike after a 30-year wait. This special Panigale V4 Tricolore pays tribute to Ducati\u2019s racing legacy, specifically the 1984 750 F1 model. Designed with Drudi Performance and Ducati\u2019s Centro Stile, the bike features an updated take on the Italian flag, along with checkered flag accents and number plates featuring the number one, highlighting its racing history. The Panigale V4 Tricolore is based on the 2025 Panigale V4, powered by a 1103cc Desmosedici Stradale V4 engine that delivers 213bhp at 13,500rpm. It continues Ducati\u2019s tradition of Tricolore special editions, starting with the 851 Desmoquattro V-twin in 1988. For the first time, Ducati brings advanced racing technology directly into a production motorcycle. The Panigale V4 Tricolore features lightweight five-spoke carbon-fibre wheels, reducing weight by nearly a kilogram to improve agility and cornering. The bike also introduces Brembo\u2019s Front Brake Pro system, which includes race-spec T-Drive discs, Hypure callipers, and an MCS 19.21 brake pump for exceptional braking performance. The Tricolore is fitted with premium components, such as a dry clutch, adjustable aluminium footpegs, and a GPS module for precise track performance. It also comes with track-ready accessories, including a carbon-fibre clutch cover, brake calliper conveyors, and a license plate removal kit. Riders will appreciate the 6.9-inch TFT dash with exclusive animations, an Alcantara seat, and a machined aluminium number plate. Each Panigale V4 Tricolore is uniquely identifiable with a numbered aluminium steering plate, a certificate of authenticity, and a custom cover. To enhance the ownership experience, Ducati offers limited-edition helmets and jackets that match the bike's striking livery, along with a bespoke ignition key and presentation box. The Panigale V4 Tricolore represents Ducati\u2019s perfect combination of advanced technology, artistry, and racing heritage. With its limited production and groundbreaking features, it stands as a true symbol of innovation and performance.

                    "description": "The 60th anniversary season is the first with new artistic director Lily Tung Crystal at the helm of the nation's oldest and largest producer of Asian American theater.",
                    "content": "East West Players artistic director Lily Tung Crystal has unveiled the lineup for her inaugural season at the helm of the nation\u2019s oldest and largest producer of Asian American theater. The company\u2019s 60th anniversary season includes a blend of classic texts and bold new works, all which are from Asian American writers and will be presented at the David Henry Hwang Theater in Los Angeles\u2019 Little Tokyo district. \u201cI wanted the season to honor our elders who paved the way for the past 60 years, and also to uplift the new generation who are coming forward in the next 60 years,\u201d Tung Crystal told The Times last week. \u201cThroughout this season, I want people to see the power and artistry of Asian American theater in the United States: we\u2019re not only creating the Asian American theater canon, but we\u2019re creating the American theater canon.\u201d The season launches with the L.A. premiere of Lauren Yee \u2019s \u201cCambodian Rock Band\u201d (Feb. 13-March 9, 2025), about a Khmer Rouge survivor who returns to Cambodia after 30 years as his daughter prepares to prosecute one of the country\u2019s most notorious war criminals. Featuring classic Cambodian rock hits and songs from the L.A. band Dengue Fever , the play made its world premiere at South Coast Repertory in 2018 and has since been programmed all over the country. \u201cYee\u2019s play is a fierce, gorgeous, heartwarming, comedic fairy tale set against one of history\u2019s grisliest mass extinctions,\u201d wrote Margaret Gray in her review for T he Times in 2018. \u201cYee has made her characters so joyfully and ridiculously human that it\u2019s impossible \u2014 to a heartbreaking degree \u2014 not to identify with them.\u201d This production, which will reunite the world premiere\u2019s original cast and director Chay Yew, brings the show to Los Angeles County, the home of the largest ethnically Cambodian population outside of Cambodia. Center Theatre Group initially planned for the piece to play at the Mark Taper Forum, but that run was canceled due to CTG\u2019s programming pause last season . Tung Crystal had helmed a Theater Mu/Jungle Theater co-production of the play in 2022, and while planning this EWP season, \u201cI thought, it\u2019s too bad that L.A. never had its production, especially since Lauren was inspired to write the show because she went to a Dengue Fever concert here,\u201d she said. \u201cL.A. deserves its own production of this magnificent show.\u201d (And it\u2019s moving forward with CTG\u2019s blessing, with artistic director Snehal Desai telling The Times, \u201cWe are thrilled that East West Players is able to bring this incredibly powerful work to LA.\u201d) The season continues with a revival of Philip Kan Gotanda\u2018s \u201cYankee Dawg You Die\u201d (July 3-27, 2025), about two Asian American actors at different stages of their careers, and the painful compromises required of actors of color to succeed in Hollywood. The play, which debuted in L.A. in 1988 , was last staged by East West Players in 2001 . \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful play that still really captures the obstacles and challenges about representation in Hollywood for Asian American actors,\u201d said Tung Crystal of the two-actor text. \u201cIncluding it as part of our 60th season, it\u2019s a reminder of the obstacles we\u2019ve had and, decades later, the obstacles we\u2019re still fighting to overcome.\u201d East West Players then presents the simultaneous world premiere of Prince Gomolvilas\u2019 \u201cParanormal Inside\u201d (Oct. 9-Nov. 2, 2025) with Theater Mu in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota and Perseverance Theater in Juneau, Alaska. The previously announced supernatural play is a haunting sequel to Gomolvilas\u2019 \u201cThe Brothers Paranormal,\u201d about two Thai siblings who launch a ghost-hunting enterprise. Jeff Liu, who helmed EWP\u2019s production of \u201cThe Brothers Paranormal\u201d in 2022, will direct the subsequent co-commission. The season also includes the Southern California premiere of Jaclyn Backhaus\u2018 \u201cWives\u201d (March 5-29, 2026), about some of history\u2019s most influential men through the eyes of their equally formidable spouses. The historically subversive comedy, which debuted off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons in 2019 , jumps between 16th century France, 1920s India and 1960s Idaho, and will feature a South Asian and South Asian American cast. \u201cOne of my visions is to try to represent the Asian American diaspora as diversely and comprehensively as possible, so it was important to include a piece by a South Asian American writer in the season,\u201d said Tung Crystal. \u201cBut also, \u2018Wives\u2019 is a sign of what\u2019s to come at East West Players: feminist work, work by women and nonbinary writers, incisive and innovative work that\u2019s intersectional in terms of gender, race, queerness and other marginalized communities.\u201d The season wraps with a production of Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s \u201cFlower Drum Song\u201d (May 28-June 21, 2026), featuring a newly updated book by David Henry Hwang. The playwright previously revised the golden-era musical \u2014 about Mei-li, a young Chinese opera artist who arrives in 1950s San Francisco Chinatown and is immediately drawn into the dazzling world of the Grant Avenue nightclubs \u2014 with a rethought libretto in 2001 ; that version premiered at the Mark Taper Forum before a brief Broadway run . Tung Crystal always planned on including a Hwang text in EWP\u2019s 60th anniversary season \u2014 \u201cHis name is on our theater, after all!\u201d she said with a laugh \u2014 and it was Hwang who suggested debuting a revised \u201cFlower Drum Song,\u201d something he\u2019s been wanting to do for some time. \u201c\u2018Flower Drum Song\u2019 changed my life because, as a young person watching the movie, it was the first time I\u2019d seen Asian American actors and singers of that caliber onscreen,\u201d said Tung Crystal, who directed a production at Palo Alto Players in 2019 and will helm the new version at East West Players. \u201cAnd though the original has its flaws and stereotypes, it has a soft spot in my heart as an homage to San Francisco Chinatown, a place that\u2019s very important to me.\u201d East West Players is also continuing its Theatre for Youth tour initiative of commissioning playwrights to create pieces about Asian American and Pacific Islander historical figures. This season\u2019s Theatre for Youth touring production is a return engagement of Elizabeth Wong\u2019s \u201cTam Tran Goes to Washington,\u201d which was commissioned in 2017 and centers on an undocumented dreamer who becomes a student activist.",

                    "content": "As the Oscars shortlist voting period looms, the race for the coveted best visual effects category is heating up. The Academy\u2019s Visual Effects Branch notified the artisans of the 20 films advancing to the next round just before the Thanksgiving holiday. Through multiple sources, Variety has confirmed 17 of the finalists that are still in the running. Shortlist voting runs from Monday, Dec. 9, to Friday, Dec. 13, and the field reflects an overwhelming amount of IP and dazzling technological achievements. From the expansive deserts of \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d to the chaotic multiverse of \u201cDeadpool and Wolverine,\u201d the finalists exemplify the artistry and innovation that define modern artisans. The films are: It\u2019s Warner Bros. that leads the way for an individual studio with the spooky sequel \u201cBeetlejuice Beetlejuice,\u201d sci-epic \u201cDune: Part Two,\u201d the action-packed \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d and the monster-clashing \u201cGodzilla x Kong: The New Empire.\u201d However, four of Disney\u2019s subsidiaries also find themselves among the candidates. 20th Century Studios\u2019 \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d and \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes,\u201d Marvel Studios\u2019 superhero mash-up \u201cDeadpool and Wolverine\u201d and Walt Disney Pictures\u2019 prequel \u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d which will have its L.A. premiere on Monday night. Paramount Pictures has three films vying for consideration with Ridley Scott\u2019s epic sequel, \u201cGladiator II,\u201d Michael Sarnoski\u2019s horror prequel \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One\u201d and Michael Gracey\u2019s Robbie Williams biopic \u201cBetter Man,\u201d where the British musician is portrayed by a CGI Monkey in a motion capture performance by Jonno Davies. Universal Pictures has two films in the running with the blockbuster musical \u201cWicked\u201d and the summer hit, \u201cTwisters.\u201d At the same time, Sony Pictures will steer two of its movies with Robert Zemeckis\u2019 \u201cHere\u201d and Jason Reitman\u2019s \u201cGhostbusters: Afterlife.\u201d Netflix secures its spot with Johan Renck\u2019s sci-fi drama \u201cSpaceman,\u201d featuring Adam Sandler alongside an extraterrestrial spider voiced by Paul Dano. Meanwhile, Alex Garland\u2019s dystopian thriller \u201cCivil War,\u201d starring Kirsten Dunst as a photojournalist, adds a cerebral edge to the mix under the A24 banner. Regarding the three mystery candidates, Variety has confirmed through multiple sources which films did not make the top 20 and are no longer in the running. Among those missing out are Robert Eggers\u2019 \u201cNosferatu,\u201d Steve McQueen\u2019s \u201cBlitz,\u201d John Krasinski\u2019s \u201cIf,\u201d J.C. Chandor\u2019s \u201cKraven the Hunter,\u201d Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cMegalopolis,\u201d Kelly Marcel\u2019s \u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d and William Goldenberg\u2019s \u201cUnstoppable.\u201d None of Variety\u2019s current best animated feature contenders made the list as well, notably \u201cFlow,\u201d \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d \u201cMemoir of a Snail,\u201d \u201cWallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl\u201d and \u201cThe Wild Robot.\u201d None of the next five animated bubble contenders are in the running either. This story will be updated when the three movies are revealed. The Academy did not comment nor confirm the list of finalists. The shortlist of 10 finalists, alongside nine other Oscar categories, will be revealed on Tuesday, Dec. 17. From there, the Visual Effects Branch will vote to narrow the field to five nominees for the 97th Academy Awards.",

                    "content": "Seven BPS schools will launch new multilingual education programs in the 2025-2026 school year, the district announced Monday, marking the largest single-year surge in BPS\u2019s language offerings. \u201cApproval of the new programs is a critical step for our district in our efforts to serve our Multilingual Learners,\u201d Superintendent Mary Skipper said Monday. \u201cThe development of these programs reflects our commitment to centering students\u2019 identities and leveraging their home languages to accelerate their learning in school.\u201d The new bilingual education programs, approved by DESE earlier this month, will be spread across five elementary schools and two secondary schools, serving English language learners. BPS officials said they developed the proposals after a community-engagement process through the last school year. In the 2025-2026 school year, over 200 students will have access to the programs, BPS officials said, and capacity is expected to expand by 30% in each subsequent year. About one-third of BPS students are English learners, the district estimates. The unprecedented expansion in these programs follows the districts launch of a \u201cInclusive Education Plan in the fall of 2023, which controversially proposed moving the majority of English learners to general education classrooms. Eight members of the district\u2019s English Learners Task Force resigned in protest of the plan. The Blackstone and Philbrick/Sumner will have dual language programs in which classes are taught in English and Spanish and students receive a \u201cSeal of Biliteracy\u201d upon high school graduation. Quincy Elementary will have a bilingual education program, in which math is taught in Mandarin and students must take a Mandarin language course. The McKay will have a transitional bilingual education program, in which multilingual students begin classes primarily in Spanish and transition to English as their proficiency develops. TechBoston Academy, Ohrenberger and English High School will have \u201cnewcomer\u201d programs aiding recently immigrated multilingual learners, with instruction primarily in English but \u201cspecific techniques\u201d to make beginner level Math, Science, and Social Studies content accessible to the students. The programs \u201crepresent hope for our English learner students,\u201d Boston School Committee member Rafaela Polanco Garcia said, noting that they \u201cwill benefit only a small portion of our student population in their first year\u201d but expand each year. In the elementary schools, three programs will be implemented for K1 students and the McKay program will be implemented in K2. The elementary programs will grow to include the next grade up each year until the program includes the whole school. The specific programs proposed are \u201cdesigned to meet the specific needs of different student populations, taking into account language patterns across Boston neighborhoods, bilingual educators in each school, and the surrounding geography of bilingual education programming,\u201d BPS officials said. \u201cThe approval of these programs sends a message to our students and school communities that we see multilingual learners as an asset and that we are dedicated to supporting them so that they can reach their full potential,\u201d said Multilingual and Multicultural Education Chief Joelle Gamere. ... \u201cWe are ready to get to work implementing the new programs, and we are fully committed to providing each school with the support and resources they need to ensure long-term success.\u201d",

                    "description": "Challenger Gordon Charlop, who sued the district last year, is looking to unseat incumbent Vanessa Tamari.",
                    "content": "A former candidate for Great Neck Park District commissioner who filed a lawsuit alleging the election he lost last year was \u201cunfair\u201d is challenging an incumbent for one of three seats on the board. Gordon Charlop, 66, who lives in an unincorporated part of North Hempstead Town, is looking to unseat incumbent Vanessa Tamari, 47, of Kensington, in the election Tuesday. Charlop, a partner at a Wall Street securities firm, was defeated by incumbent Tina Stellato last December, 1,580-710. Tamari, elected to the board in 2021, is seeking a second three-year term. She is an attorney specializing in medical malpractice and insurance defense. Tamari was inspired to run after watching her children make memories around the park system, like sledding during snowstorms, and hiking, she said. Park commissioners operate 16 parks spanning 264 acres, and the department's 2024 budget is $19.9 million, Tamari said. Tamari is particularly proud of the implementation of a farmers market during her term, as well as diversifying the district\u2019s concert series: In August, Vivi Hu performed a bilingual concert in English and Mandarin. Tamari said the district recently bought a portion of waterfront green space, a little more than half an acre, adjacent to Steppingstone Park, with a panoramic view of the Throgs Neck Bridge. \u201cOur parks are busier than ever,\u201d Tamari said. \u201cPeople are getting out of the house, socializing, breathing fresh air, enjoying nature, enjoying music, enjoying company, enjoying the change of seasons, nature.\u201d Tamari would like to continue more of the same initiatives if she's reelected. She\u2019s also expressed interest in adding pickleball courts and acquiring more parkland. Charlop, however, paints a darker picture of the state of the parks system. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be that my senior citizens can\u2019t walk around my parks safely because the cement is cracked and uneven,\u201d Charlop said. He said he has heard from parents who won\u2019t allow their children in the playgrounds because of nearby piled-up trash. Charlop, a partner at Rosenblatt Securities, accused the current board of misallocating funds for various projects. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of questions, and the only way we can figure it out is if I can get in the building, if I can become a commissioner,\u201d Charlop said. After the election last year, he filed suit in State Supreme Court in Nassau County, accusing the park district of employing \"illegal\" absentee ballot procedures. His lawsuit asked the judge to invalidate the results of the election. He claimed the absentee ballot application the park district distributed to voters was improper. The park district argued in court papers that a State Supreme Court judge has no standing to interfere with the results of an election. Charlop's attorney, Jonathan Silver, eventually acknowledged in a follow-up motion that the park district was correct and instead asked for access to the race\u2019s absentee ballots and voting machine results. In September, a State Supreme Court judge in Nassau granted Charlop access to the absentee ballots from the election. Charlop then hired Richard Picciochi, a Floral Park-based forensic document examiner, to review the results. Picciochi reviewed 144 copies of absentee voter applications and their corresponding ballots and found that 114 pairs were \u201ceither probably or highly probably not written by the same person,\u201d according to his report. Charlop has expressed skepticism about the integrity of this year\u2019s election. Tamari said Charlop\u2019s claims were \u201cpreposterous.\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019ve brought a lot of joy to people\u2019s lives. I don\u2019t want to delve into whatever narrative he\u2019s putting out there,\u201d Tamari said. \u201cI know that we\u2019ve run the elections very fairly. I know that we\u2019ve done everything the way it should be.\u201d Joshua Needelman covers the Town of North Hempstead for Newsday.

                    "content": "U.S. Ambassador to Canada David Cohen says while Canada's defence spending is going in the right direction, the federal government's persistent failure to meet NATO targets has been damaging to the country's reputation on the world stage. Canada is one of the few countries that has yet to meet the alliance's agreed-upon goal to spend two per cent of GDP on defence. And the re-election of Donald Trump in the United States has added a new sense of urgency, with many Canadian and American politicians commenting in recent months that the country's lagging contributions on defence will likely become a priority, once again, for the incoming president. In an interview for CTV's Question Period airing Sunday, Cohen underscored a point he's made previously, that he doesn't believe the percentage of GDP spending should be the only metric by which a country's contribution to the alliance is measured. But he conceded that Canada's failure to meet the target, despite having signed on to it more than a decade ago, is having an impact. \"There is no doubt that what you hear from American politicians, from other NATO allies about Canada falling so consistently short against an important metric, without the nuance of everything that follows, that it has hurt Canada's standing in the world from a defence-related perspective,\" Cohen told host Vassy Kapelos. The ambassador \u2014 who is set to be replaced with Trump's pick, former Michigan congressman Pete Hoekstra, pending his confirmation by the U.S. Senate in January \u2014 added that alliance members see Canada has been \"stepping up,\" pointing to recent spending announcements from the federal government. \"And I think they view Canada as being responsive to these concerns, and I think that will begin to bring Canada's standing in the world back, and to do it pretty quickly,\" he said. Cohen said the \"nuanced view\" of the issue includes taking into account Canada's contributions to not only NATO, but other defence-related initiatives. He pointed specifically to cybersecurity, space, and work in Haiti and Ukraine as line items that don't necessarily count toward the NATO figure. But, he added, \"to be clear, the United States and I would like Canada to spend more on defence.\" \"And so my concern has been with the what I think is an unhealthy focus on the percentage ... of its GDP that Canada spends on defence, that is the one metric that too many people tend to focus on,\" he added. \"I prefer to focus on the rate of spend, what's been happening with Canada's spend and the trajectory of spend.\" Cohen said even accounting exclusively for the percentage-of-GDP figure, Canada's spending is on the rise. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged this summer to meet the target by 2032, eight years after the initially agreed-upon deadline. In interviews on CTV's Question Period in recent months, U.S. House intelligence committee chair and Ohio Rep. Mike Turner said Canada is \"already past due\" on its commitments, Trump's former ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft said 2032 is \"not good enough,\" and former Canadian ambassador to the U.S. Derek Burney called Canada \"irrelevant\" and \"a laggard\" on defence spending. Cohen's more recent comments echo those he's been making for months, however. In an interview on Question Period last June, he said that while Canada needs to spend more on defence, the U.S. does not \"measure Canada's commitment to defence by reference to any single metric.\" In his interview, Cohen also discussed border security, amid Trump's threats to hit Canada with 25 per cent tariffs on all imports until it stops the flow of illegal drugs and migrants over the border. He also shared his views on North American free trade, after the premiers of some provinces suggested Canada establish a bilateral agreement with the United States, cutting Mexico out of the existing deal. On that issue, Cohen said he comes from \"a school of 'if it ain't broke don't fix it,'\" and calling the current iteration of NAFTA \"really incredible.\" You can watch Cohen's full interview on CTV Question Period Sunday morning at 11ET/8PT on CTV and CTV News Channel.

                    "description": "President Joe Biden on Monday designated a federal monument in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, at a former boarding school that mistreated Native American children in an attempt to assimilate them \u2014 and served as a model for similar institutions across the country.",
                    "content": "President Joe Biden on Monday designated a federal monument in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, at a former boarding school that mistreated Native American children in an attempt to assimilate them \u2014 and served as a model for similar institutions across the country. From 1879 to 1918, the Carlisle Indian Industrial School was the flagship operation of federally funded, off-reservation boarding schools that forcibly and coercively took Native American children away from their homes to erase their cultural identities, names, languages, traditions, religions and family ties. The philosophy for the forced assimilation at the school \u2014 which included beatings and deadly epidemics \u2014 was to \u201c Kill the Indian in him , and save the man.\u201d The Carlisle model was replicated in more than 417 federally supported boarding schools over the next century, along with others that operated without government support, according to the White House. While the schools were seen by white society as a more progressive method than outright killing Natives, nearly 1,000 children, including more than 180 in Carlisle, have been recorded as dying while attending the at-times deadly schools, and the number is likely much higher, according to the White House. Biden held a summit with tribal leaders on Monday. In October, he provided formal apology on behalf of the United States for the schools. Louellyn White , a Kanien\u02bckeha\u0301:ka (Mohawk of Akwesasne) descendant of Carlisle, whose grandfather and other family members were sent to the Carlisle school, said the recognition \u201cis a long time coming.\u201d White teaches Indigenous Studies at Concordia University in Montreal and has been involved in historic preservation and repatriation efforts at the Carlisle school, where she said indigenous children remain buried on school grounds \u2014 as well as across Pennsylvania. \u201cThis kind of recognition and acknowledgment will help to educate the public, create increased awareness, and contribute to healing Indigenous communities,\u201d she added. The site of the former boarding school is now located within the United States Army\u2019s Carlisle Barracks, which is home to the U.S. Army War College and, according to the proclamation, one of the oldest military installations in the country. In 1863, Confederate troops torched buildings on the campus that served as a central supply center for the Union Army in the Civil War before the government rebuilt the barracks for the Army before it became a boarding school. It was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1961 and added to the National Register of Historic places in 1966, according to the White House. The monument boundaries align with those of the landmark, and the new designation \u201cwill help ensure this shameful chapter of American history is never forgotten or repeated,\u201d according to the White House. The monument will be managed by the National Park Service and U.S. Army, and both entities will work in the coming years to develop national park programming at the site in consultation with tribes. The site includes 24 historic structures that were part of the school\u2019s campus, as well as gateposts that were constructed by children at the boarding school. Biden\u2019s proclamation acknowledged that Native American children were taken to these schools and stripped of their languages, religions, and cultures, as well as subject to physical and sexual abuse, compulsory labor, corporal punishment, and insufficient nutrition and medical care. At Carlisle, they were forced to study Catholicism and prohibited from speaking their Native languages. Staff at the schools cut their hair and forced them to give up their traditional names and clothing. The proclamation includes quotes from natives recounting the trauma of having their hair forcibly cut off when they arrived at the school, including Zitkala-Sa, a Dakota woman from the Yankton Sioux Reservation, who said she was dragged from her hiding spot under a bed and tied to a chair. \u201cThen I lost my spirit. ... In my anguish I moaned for my mother, but no one came to comfort me ... for now I was only one of many little animals driven by a herder,\u201d she said. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American Cabinet secretary, whose great grandfather and grandparents were taken from their families and taken to boarding schools, has focused on documenting the schools through the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative . She said she launched the effort to make sure people can learn about the intergenerational impacts of the policies surrounding the schools. \u201cNo single action by the federal government can adequately reconcile the trauma and ongoing harms from the federal Indian boarding school era,\u201d said Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe. \"... This trauma is not new to Indigenous people, but it is new for many people in our nation.\u201d The proclamation acknowledges that the concept of using education and separation to control native children goes back centuries to early colonial times. The 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act ended the forced assimilation policies that permitted the boarding schools, but the government never fully investigated the system until the Biden administration, The Associated Press reported. \u201cFor almost 40 years, the Department of the Interior operated the Carlisle School as an Indian Industrial School, melding the approach of incarceration with assimilative education policies,\u201d the proclamation says. The office of U.S. Rep. Scott Perry , a Republican whose district includes Carlisle, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \u00a92024 The Philadelphia Inquirer. Visit inquirer.com .

                    "content": "President Joe Biden on Monday designated a federal monument in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, at a former boarding school that mistreated Native American children in an attempt to assimilate them \u2014 and served as a model for similar institutions across the country. From 1879 to 1918, the Carlisle Indian Industrial School was the flagship operation of federally funded, off-reservation boarding schools that forcibly and coercively took Native American children away from their homes to erase their cultural identities, names, languages, traditions, religions and family ties. The philosophy for the forced assimilation at the school \u2014 which included beatings and deadly epidemics \u2014 was to \u201c Kill the Indian in him , and save the man.\u201d The Carlisle model was replicated in more than 417 federally supported boarding schools over the next century, along with others that operated without government support, according to the White House. While the schools were seen by white society as a more progressive method than outright killing Natives, nearly 1,000 children, including more than 180 in Carlisle, have been recorded as dying while attending the at-times deadly schools, and the number is likely much higher, according to the White House. Biden held a summit with tribal leaders on Monday. In October, he provided formal apology on behalf of the United States for the schools. Louellyn White , a Kanien\u02bckeha\u0301:ka (Mohawk of Akwesasne) descendant of Carlisle, whose grandfather and other family members were sent to the Carlisle school, said the recognition \u201cis a long time coming.\u201d White teaches Indigenous Studies at Concordia University in Montreal and has been involved in historic preservation and repatriation efforts at the Carlisle school, where she said indigenous children remain buried on school grounds \u2014 as well as across Pennsylvania. \u201cThis kind of recognition and acknowledgment will help to educate the public, create increased awareness, and contribute to healing Indigenous communities,\u201d she added. The site of the former boarding school is now located within the United States Army\u2019s Carlisle Barracks, which is home to the U.S. Army War College and, according to the proclamation, one of the oldest military installations in the country. In 1863, Confederate troops torched buildings on the campus that served as a central supply center for the Union Army in the Civil War before the government rebuilt the barracks for the Army before it became a boarding school. It was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1961 and added to the National Register of Historic places in 1966, according to the White House. The monument boundaries align with those of the landmark, and the new designation \u201cwill help ensure this shameful chapter of American history is never forgotten or repeated,\u201d according to the White House. The monument will be managed by the National Park Service and U.S. Army, and both entities will work in the coming years to develop national park programming at the site in consultation with tribes. The site includes 24 historic structures that were part of the school\u2019s campus, as well as gateposts that were constructed by children at the boarding school. Biden\u2019s proclamation acknowledged that Native American children were taken to these schools and stripped of their languages, religions, and cultures, as well as subject to physical and sexual abuse, compulsory labor, corporal punishment, and insufficient nutrition and medical care. At Carlisle, they were forced to study Catholicism and prohibited from speaking their Native languages. Staff at the schools cut their hair and forced them to give up their traditional names and clothing. The proclamation includes quotes from natives recounting the trauma of having their hair forcibly cut off when they arrived at the school, including Zitkala-Sa, a Dakota woman from the Yankton Sioux Reservation, who said she was dragged from her hiding spot under a bed and tied to a chair. \u201cThen I lost my spirit. ... In my anguish I moaned for my mother, but no one came to comfort me ... for now I was only one of many little animals driven by a herder,\u201d she said. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American Cabinet secretary, whose great grandfather and grandparents were taken from their families and taken to boarding schools, has focused on documenting the schools through the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative . She said she launched the effort to make sure people can learn about the intergenerational impacts of the policies surrounding the schools. \u201cNo single action by the federal government can adequately reconcile the trauma and ongoing harms from the federal Indian boarding school era,\u201d said Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe. \"... This trauma is not new to Indigenous people, but it is new for many people in our nation.\u201d The proclamation acknowledges that the concept of using education and separation to control native children goes back centuries to early colonial times. The 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act ended the forced assimilation policies that permitted the boarding schools, but the government never fully investigated the system until the Biden administration, The Associated Press reported. \u201cFor almost 40 years, the Department of the Interior operated the Carlisle School as an Indian Industrial School, melding the approach of incarceration with assimilative education policies,\u201d the proclamation says. The office of U.S. Rep. Scott Perry , a Republican whose district includes Carlisle, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \u00a92024 The Philadelphia Inquirer. Visit inquirer.com .

                    "description": "\"Know thyself is a deep concept and drives my own personal journey in my quest to reconnect with my soul and others on this journey of being human,\" writes columnist Claire Nielsen.",
                    "content": "The question \u2018Who am I?\u2019 has intrigued mankind since the birth of our consciousness. I remember the first time I asked myself \u2018Who am I?\u2019 I think I was about nine or 10 years old. This query embarked me on a journey of self-discovery and investigation into religion and spirituality, my connection to nature, my place in the universe, and what was going on in my own mind and body. I am obviously still on this journey with many unanswered questions and distractions, but I have some theories that have brought me some peace over the years. I think we seek this question of self-discovery as an intrinsic longing and drive for (re)connection and belonging. We do many things to fulfil our individual needs for self-identity. When we choose to find our identity through the eyes of others, we may compete using money and acquisitions, success, education and knowledge, beauty, power and control, popularity, physical ability, and sports...etc. In this way, we answer the question of \u2018Who am I?\u2019 with the answer \u2018I prove myself to others by...\u2019 or \u2018I need to be better than others through...\u2019 Even though competition is a normal part of human culture, I don\u2019t feel it should be the focus that drives us in our personal self-discovery work, as it can be a great distraction. Also, the competitive drive for validation will only fulfil our longing for identity for so long, as we eventually lose our edge and fall off our own pedestal. Who are we then? The humbling of mankind happens when we stop viewing our own identity through what others may think (or what we think they think). When we are humbled by our inability to compete anymore, we can become angry and bitter or we can let it go and look for another identity. We see this in older age: people either soften to each other (mellowing with age) or get angry, frustrated or resentful at their own inability to compete anymore. Know thyself is a deep concept and drives my own personal journey in my quest to reconnect with my soul and others on this journey of being human. My interpretation of know thyself is to understand the concept of the trilogy body, mind and spirit. I want to know my body and understand what it is telling me \u2014 how to optimally survive in my human physical existence. Am I listening to my body and honouring what it tells me? (Inflammation is how our body says \u2018No\u2019 and can take many forms). I have written many articles on physical health, inflammation, and the nutritional component to being healthy. What do I need to do (or stop doing) in order to be healthy in this temporary human vehicle? Can I be courageous enough to know my mind and understand the duality of my thinking, while making friends with my egoic mind (rather than resisting it) in the process? In this way, I can make sense of my attachments, my addictions, my judgments, my resistance, my suffering... but also embrace the power of my beautiful mind to create and manifest, connect to gratitude, be present, and to choose the energy of love to guide me in this journey. This intention to understand the complexities of our minds often involves some healing. Which leads me to spirit. As we navigate this dualistic experience in our human bodies and minds, connecting to spirit can move us out of the unhealthy chaos in our minds and into the centre of our being. I feel the centre of my being (my soul within) at the top of my breath and I use my breath when I have the intention to connect spiritually. I often connect with gratitude in my focused breathing, while sending love on my exhaled breath to wherever it may be needed in the form of a prayer for the suffering of humanity. Sometimes my prayer is directed towards an individual or group or situation, or the earth, and sometimes I just send this loving intention for healing to the ether and trust it will land where it is needed. If needed, I send a prayer of love and healing to the trauma from my childhood. This seems to soften my attachment to that which caused my suffering. Finding a meditative practice using one\u2019s breath can be very healing to the mind and body, and help facilitate a beautiful spiritual connection. The Latin word for spirit is spi\u0304ritus, which literally means breath. Most religions use breathwork to access a spiritual connection to their definition of source or creation. During our time as being human, our breath is our life force, and we live our lives one present breath at a time. There are many definitions of creator depending on what spiritual practice one aligns with, but the word religion literally means reconnection, and I feel that having a discerning and loving practice of reconnection is the reason for our individual spiritual beliefs and practices. (\u201cThere are many paths to enlightenment \u2014 be sure to take the one with a loving heart.\" Lau Tzu) As we come to know ourselves in body, mind and spirit, we have the opportunity to settle into an acceptance of who we really are and let go of resistance and misconceptions that cause anxiety (fear) and the lack of presence. To know thyself is an idea that has been contemplated since man has had a thinking mind. It drives each of our individual journeys and the paths of our lives. Author's note: I tend to avoid publishing articles on spirituality, as they are my own personal opinions and I don\u2019t want to ruffle too many feathers but felt compelled to share my interpretation of the connection of body, mind and spirit in our quest to learn who we are. Everyone may have their own perception, understanding and reconnection practice \u2014 so to each his/her/their own. I dedicate this article to all those with seeking minds.

As eJewishPhilantropy reported , Jewish Journeys is a national survey designed to understand Jewish perspectives on substances like psilocybin , LSD , MDMA and ayahuasca .

The Need For Cultural Sensitivity The growing interest in psychedelics across the U.S., particularly as potential treatments for mental health issues, has prompted religious communities to consider how these substances fit into their faith. Rabbi Zac Kamenetz , the CEO of Shefa, saw a gap in how the Jewish community was engaging with this trend. A former \"D.A.R.E. kid\" who was initially wary of psychedelics, Kamenetz had a transformative experience with psilocybin in 2017, during a study at Johns Hopkins University . He realized that while the Jewish community was embracing more spiritual practices, the conversation about psychedelics was largely absent. \"If psychedelics were going to become more accessible, the Jewish community wasn't ready to handle the implications they might have on Jewish theology, community and creativity,\" Kamenetz says. Understanding The Jewish Psychedelic Experience To address this gap, Shefa partnered with Emory University to conduct the Jewish Journeys study. The research aims to explore why Jewish Americans use psychedelics, whether for healing, spiritual growth, or recreational purposes, and what role these substances play in their lives. The survey is not about promoting or condemning psychedelic use, but about understanding it within the context of Jewish identity. \"We're not giving anyone drugs,\" Kamenetz stresses. \"We want to know why people are using these substances. This is a principle of harm reduction, being informed and addressing reality, not judging it.\" The study, funded by the Jim Joseph Foundation's Common Era initiative, targets a broad sample: 1,500 Jewish Americans who have used psychedelics, those curious about them and those who are skeptical. The online survey includes questions about participants' beliefs on substances, their impact on society and their spiritual connections. Follow-up interviews will provide deeper insights into individual experiences with psychedelics. Breaking The Stigma In The Jewish Community As the use of psychedelics rises , many Jewish people are exploring them for spiritual reasons, with some even drawing parallels to traditional religious experiences. Kamenetz notes the long-standing Jewish involvement in music subcultures, like the Grateful Dead and Phish communities, which have historically embraced psychedelic culture. Even within Jewish practice, altering consciousness is a familiar concept, such as the use of wine during Kiddush. Despite this, there remains significant stigma surrounding drug use within the Jewish community. Kamenetz hopes that the Jewish Journeys study will break down this taboo. \"You don't talk about drug use in polite society,\" he says, urging religious leaders to be more open-minded and informed about their community members' experiences with psychedelics. Such openness, he says, could bridge the gap between spirituality and psychedelic exploration. Shaping A More Informed Future One of the study's goals is to help Jewish religious leaders understand the spiritual needs of those using psychedelics. \"The increase in accessibility to psychedelics is going to change the social fabric of some communities,\" says Aaron D. Cherniak , a clinical psychologist and rabbi studying the intersection of religion and psychedelics. The research also aims to explore whether psychedelics can be integrated into Jewish spiritual practices. Some individuals in the psychedelic community suggest that Jewish tradition may have historical links to mind-altering substances . Others argue that psychedelics have no place in communal Jewish life, as they tend to encourage individual, rather than collective, spiritual experiences. Kamenetz acknowledges that the role of psychedelics in Jewish life remains uncertain but believes that understanding the diverse experiences within the Jewish community is essential for providing the necessary support. He says, \"People are having profound experiences, but there's often no framework in the community to help them integrate these experiences meaningfully.\" Cover image made with AI \u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

                    "content": "The Biden administration on Monday designated the Carlisle Federal Indian Boarding School National Monument as part of its efforts to strengthen relationships with tribal nations. President Joe Biden announced the designation Monday during the fourth White House Tribal Nations Summit in Washington, D.C. The monument at Carlisle Barracks will tell the story of the oppression endured by thousands of Native American children and their families at the former Carlisle Indian Industrial School, according to the White House. Through the monument, the White House said Biden is acknowledging the federal Indian boarding school era. \u201cDesignating the former campus of the Carlisle school, with boundaries consistent with the National Historic Landmark, as a national monument will help ensure this shameful chapter of American history is never forgotten or repeated,\u201d Biden\u2019s proclamation reads. \u201cEstablishing a national monument at the historic Carlisle school and acknowledging the federal government\u2019s policies aimed at destroying tribal and indigenous political structures, cultures and traditions\u2014including through the federal Indian boarding school system\u2014takes a step toward redress and national healing in the arc of the survival, resilience and triumph of Indian Tribes (including Alaska Native villages) and the native Hawaiian community.\u201d The Carlisle Indian Industrial School from 1879 to 1918 took about 7,800 children from more than 140 tribes with the aim of assimilation by stripping them of their languages, religions and cultures. The White House said Carlisle\u2019s school became the model for other federal boarding schools, which operated throughout the early 19th and mid-20th centuries and comprised more than 400 other federally supported, off-reservation schools, not including other similar religious institutions. The White House said that at least 973 children died at these federal schools, and those who survived endured physical, emotional and sexual abuse. The White House reported that at the Carlisle schools, officials forced children to cut their hair, prohibited them from speaking their Native languages and subjected them to harsh labor. More than 180 children died at just the Carlisle location, and those who were still at the school when it closed in 1918 were transferred to other boarding schools. The new monument\u2019s boundary encompasses the 24 historic buildings and structures that made up the former school, including the School Road gateposts, which were built by youths at the school and are still on post. The monument will be cooperatively managed by the National Park Service and the U.S. Army. Both will work with tribal nations and the Native Hawaiian Community in development of an ongoing management plan of the monument to ensure it tells the full story of the site. The former school campus was already designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. Get local news delivered to your inbox!

                    "description": "Studies show that spiritual practices like meditation and prayer can lower anxiety and depression and create a sense of hope despite external hardships.",
                    "content": "Spirituality is a multi-faceted term encompassing various concepts tied to identity, purpose, and connection. While religions function with a set of organized beliefs, spirituality is a highly flexible way to obtain inner peace and connection to a higher power. No matter what spirituality looks like to an individual, it involves universal themes of love, belonging, compassion, and shared experiences of reality. Spirituality can be a catalyst for personal growth and fulfillment, and significantly enhance physical and mental well-being. Studies show that spiritual practices like meditation and prayer can lower anxiety and depression and create a sense of hope despite external hardships. This provides an unwavering sense of purpose and support in navigating challenging periods of life. Maintaining a strong spiritual practice also comes with additional benefits including promoting social cohesion and ethics. Ultimately, spirituality is a driving force behind self-actualization, a person's ability to be a contributing member of society and sometimes provides a direct experience of unity. It should be no surprise then, that spirituality has been on the rise in recent years, especially after the pandemic rocked everyone's faith in humanity. In 2023, 70% of American adults considered themselves spiritual, either because they identify as such or find importance in spiritual habits. This portion of the nation's population is growing steadily as younger generations move away from institutionalized religion for a more individualized faith path aligned with their unique views on life. David Kosak , a prominent faith leader and Senior Rabbi at Congregation Neveh Shalom, sees positivity in this trend. An increase in spirituality isn't a threat to organized religions. It can actually increase faith diversity and encourage communities to be tolerant of differences. However, David advocates for spiritual or religious individuals to learn about the three types of spirituality and their impact on communities. Religion or spiritual groups can exhibit a variety of these traits at once, but David believes unity spirituality is the most beneficial for humanity. He draws on analogies about human tribalism and the environment to explain why. Violence, bigotry, and a sense of superiority are the defining characteristics of splinter spirituality, which exacerbates human's inherent sense of tribalism. Because many individuals have only encountered splinter spirituality, they have a negative perception of religion and the way it can divide society. The second manifestation is identity spirituality. This belief system places a strong emphasis on rituals, talismans, and other behaviors that can be considered religious behaviorism that impart a sense of connection without personal transformation. Unity spirituality, the expression of belief that David advocates for, differs from the previous types because of its transformational nature. When compared to identity-based or splinter spirituality, this unifying approach transcends the inherited structure of belief, enabling people to discover themselves as they deepen their faith. This is a major reason why David cites unity spirituality as the gold standard for how people should strive to express their beliefs. \"Unity spirituality is a term I coined to describe a kind of perennial wisdom that allows the devout to find belonging and experience inner growth while also recognizing the commonalities they share with others,\" David says. \"The basis of this positive expression of spirituality lies in its focus on compassion, tolerance, and humanity while honoring all creation. Rather than getting bogged down by the things that separate us, people embracing this school of thought are open enough to sense that we as humans are all connected regardless of any distinction we can see with our eyes.\" In an age where polarization is at an all-time high, David's take on community and collective responsibility is a bit jarring. Although the thought leader never places blame on individuals for falling into their primal urge to identify strongly with social groups, humans have an innate tendency to demonstrate favoritism for 'in-groups' and hostility toward 'out-groups'. This tribalism is an evolutionary default mechanism for humans, who have used this practice to evade predators and survive harsh conditions. Instead of focusing on what people can't control, David brings attention to strategies and perspectives that can temper this drive and therefore unite communities. \"Nonviolent communication and frequent conversations at the intersection of different faith groups are powerful antidotes against prejudice and discrimination,\" David explains. \"Humans empathize more with people they are familiar with and often seek out information and groups that validate their existing beliefs. When most of us live in a bubble of curated experiences and social groups aligned to our perspective, it's difficult to break out of this shell and see how our preconceived notions are actually misguided.\" The first step to nurturing this sense of unity and connection requires a conscious decision fueled by courage and faith. However, this investment pays generous dividends to those stepping outside their comfort zone. Enhanced creativity, problem-solving, and better interpersonal relationships are just a few benefits for individuals who welcome diversity\u2013whether it be tied to spirituality or not. From a big-picture context, the collective can also experience advantages from unity spirituality and the tolerance that comes with it. David uses the environmental crisis as a timely example of what's possible when people work together. \"Humanity repaired gaping holes in the ozone layer by making technical changes that protected our atmosphere. Whether we're looking to shore up the holes in our planet or our souls, society can find medicine in our fellow man just as easily as other resources,\" he says. Some might even argue that climate change is a symptom of society's spiritual defects that manifest as a scientifically driven phenomenon. When examined from this angle, faith quickly becomes a common denominator for healing, unity, and progress. When society limits itself to identity or splinter spirituality people experience the world as deeply subjective and remain divided. Unity spirituality, however, provides a more objective and universal experience of humanity's bonds with one another. As more people awaken to this, David envisions a society where people find solace in one another and work together to conquer challenges and achieve harmony.",

                    "content": "Ethiopia is celebrating the ideals of multi-national identity and unity. The different cultures, languages, customs, and traditions in Ethiopia are the fabrics that have tied the people in unity. The diversity in Ethiopia has remained intact despite some hiccups in the past. The time-tested gems--diverse culture, tradition, languages...--did not create chasm among the people. As it holds truth for any society, porous cultural boundaries have contributed to the sharing of values with one another. The people of Ethiopia, irrespective of differences in various ways, have cherished togetherness and unity. Social and natural forces inevitably contribute to fostering social integration, as many scholars of the area agree. In Ethiopia as well, inter-cultural marriages are common. There are still traditional marketplaces where people of diverse linguistic, cultural, and religious backgrounds traded goods and even beyond among one another. One of the best examples of such a sort is the Bati Marketplace in north-central Ethiopia. The mosaic of cultures and diversity of goods in the market has been astounding travelers and tourists alike. The marketplace is a meeting point of people who have different linguistic and cultural backgrounds. The Amharas, Oromos, Afars and Argobas exchange their goods in the market. One could enjoy the traditional attire of the people who buy and sell goods. The market hosts the culture of the highlander and lowlander Ethiopians. The market force creates opportunities for the people to transcend linguistic and cultural boundaries indeed. There, they nourish togetherness, love, and respect. The interaction is an avid example of the inevitability of mutual interdependence among them. The question is: Have these invaluable assets contributed to creating multinational identity and unity in Ethiopia? The answer to the question is not, of course, a low-hanging fruit. It needs a thorough analysis and discussion. But nobody denies the fact that Ethiopians, irrespective of differences, pursued an enemy that crossed their natural boundary to subdue them on March 1, 1896. Had the differences been deep to the extent of creating division, the victory of Adwa could have been impossible. Ethiopians exhibited their wisdom in standing together for a noble goal in the terrains of Adwa. But, over the last few decades, the concept of 'multi-national identity' was misinterpreted. The past regime used it to prolong its grip on power. In the guise of Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Day, the people were made to bear the yoke of division and discord. The mishandling of the concept paved the way for some to overlook the unity that forefathers and foremothers crafted. The wrong path taken did not reflect the true characteristics of the people witnessed in the day-to-day life. Today, Ethiopia is marking the true tenets of multinational identity and unity. The diverse culture, languages, traditions, customs, and religions are the pearls of Ethiopia. Ethiopia shines and ascends to greatness through the proper exercise of multinational identity and unity.

The different cultures, languages, religions, heritages, and the like are assets of immense value that serve to lay a solid foundation of multinational identity and unity. No doubt, today's Ethiopia regards the past in a positive way; it works to heal the past wounds for the sake of creating a better future. With the tenets of Medemer that are introduced by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (Ph.D.), Ethiopia and its people contribute all their spiritual and material resources to usher themselves and their country into a new era of prosperity through the exercise of genuine federalism and promotion of multi-national identity and unity.

                    "description": "Syria at a crossroads: What fate awaits the country after the fall of al-Assad?",
                    "content": "As rebels seize control in Syria after more than a decade of war, the future is uncertain. Key concerns include al-Assad's allies, regional dynamics, and potential for further conflict. In light of the dramatic scenes in Syria and the acceleration of events over the course of a handful of days, it seems that the Middle Eastern country is about to enter an ambiguous phase, opening a myriad of possibilities. Just looking at the map of the country, the region and even beyond, there are several question marks that may not be answered soon. Who will rule the country? What about the ousted Bashar al-Assad regime's allies in Tehran, Beirut and Moscow? What about his bitter enemies, and what fate awaits Syria after al-Assad? Syria's soft underbelly, Lebanon, is preoccupied with its internal problems, the devastating Israeli war that claimed the lives of nearly 4,000 people. Al-Assad's former lly Hezbollah is exhausted by the war it fought against Tel Aviv, which ended with the announcement of a fragile 60-day ceasefire that witnessed daily violations from the Israeli side that have so far resulted in destruction, deaths and injuries even among the Lebanese army, which is supposed to oversee the implementation of the ceasefire. With the change in the political scene in Damascus, the supply line from Iran to Hezbollah through Syria will be cut off or, at best, not be easy. Syria will no longer be the backyard of Hezbollah, which was crucial to al-Assad's restoration of control in his war against armed opposition groups after it intervened in the conflict in 2013 under the pretext of protecting Lebanese territory from attacks by these groups, as well as protecting the shrine of Sayyida Zainab in the outskirts of Damascus, which has a special status among Shiite Muslims and which, if compromised, would have caused further sectarian tension and rivalry between Sunnis and Shiites. Turkey has tried to distance itself from the spectacular advances of armed groups in recent days and has emphasised that it is not involved in the operation. This is despite the support it has given to the opposition since the beginning of the uprising against al-Assad's rule, opening its borders to displaced Syrians at the time. Ankara has also hosted opposition figures and provided support for the Syrian National Army. Yet, a solution to the dilemma of the estimated three million Syrian refugees in Turkey if security is restored in Syria and the country avoids entering a new cycle of chaos is still unclear. Meanwhile, there's also Israel. The neighbouring country occupied the contested Golan Heights region of Syria for more than 57 years before announcing its annexation. Washington recognised this annexation under the previous Trump administration despite clear international resolutions that consider the Golan Heights to be occupied territory. Two days ago, Israel mobilised its air and ground forces in the Golan Heights in anticipation of any emergency and has since seized control of the entire territory. Israel is likely to closely monitor what is happening in Syria, especially if a regime that emerges is inward-looking and preoccupied with its internal problems and does not claim its right to the Golan Heights or reach the shores of Lake Tiberias. As for Iran, it has lost an important and vital ally in the region. The history of relations between the two countries goes back many decades before Bashar al-Assad even came to power. Interests converged between an Islamist regime that emerged from the Khomeini-led revolution that toppled the shah in 1979 and a secular nationalist regime led by the Ba'ath Party headed by Bashar al-Assad's father, Hafez. At the time, Hafez al-Assad supported Tehran in its war against Iraq in the 1980s. The two sides were united in their hostility to the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and their rivalry with Washington, which was providing military support to Iraq in its eight-year war against Iran in the 1980s. There is also the role Quds Force commander General Qassem Soleimani \u2014 who was killed by a US raid in Baghdad in early 2020 \u2014 played in preventing the fall of the regime and managing the military operations in Aleppo in 2015, where he personally led the battle to break the siege on Syria's largest city and the country's economic capital, and was then called by the opposition the Butcher of Aleppo. By losing its ally in Damascus, Tehran is the biggest loser in the region. However, it seems to be taking a cautious stance on recent developments, reflected in timid and measured statements on the situation in Syria. It is also preoccupied with other challenges and files, namely the deepening hostility between it and Israel and the US, which stands on the threshold of a new administration led by Republican President-elect Donald Trump. With the nuclear file still unresolved and buckling under US and international sanctions, the Tehran regime is apprehensive about the next stage. This has been further made visible by Trump's nomination of veteran diplomat Brian Hook, known for his hard-line positions towards Iran since President George W Bush's era, to be the special envoy in charge of the country file. Famously, Moscow remains one of the most important stakeholders in what is happening in Syria. The departure of al-Assad could be a major blow to the Kremlin, which has military sites in Syria. The most important of these are the Hmeimim Air Base, located southeast of the city of Latakia, and the Tartus naval base. These two sites gave Russia access to the Mediterranean waters from its eastern bank, serving its interests in the region and Africa as well. Vladimir Putin's Russia has provided significant military support to the regime since 2015, with some 4,000 troops on the ground. This support, under the banner of fighting the so-called IS and extremist groups, has been crucial in maintaining al-Assad's rule. The fall of the regime would mean that Moscow would no longer have a foothold in Syria, given the deep-seated hostility of armed groups. Geostrategically, it would be a blow to Putin, who has been fighting a war in Ukraine for nearly three years. These developments may be a factor in resolving the war in Ukraine and further influence the conflict between NATO and Western countries on the one hand and Russia on the other. Now that armed groups led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham \u2014 formerly Jabhat al-Nusra \u2014 have taken control of the government in Syria, and with the different ideological agendas of these groups and the association of some of them with regional and international powers, the situation remains hazy, if not bleak. No one can say with certainty that the country will not be divided and a democratic transition of power will not take place or whether Syria can avoid a fate similar to that of Libya since its uprising against the Muammar al-Gaddafi regime on 17 February 2011. The North African country has been divided for years between an internationally recognised government based in Tripoli in the west and a government in the east led by Libya's strongman, Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, further contributing to regional and international polarisation. So far, all attempts have failed to heal the rift between the two sides and put an end to the rivalry that has resulted in hundreds of deaths and the imposition of two governments, two central banks, armed forces and militias, dilapidated infrastructure and a collapsed economy despite the country's vast oil wealth. Another fear is the repeat of the Afghanistan scenario, where the Taliban surprisingly took complete control on 15 August 2021, and the imposition of a hardline Islamist regime there following the withdrawal of the US and other international forces. What if Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which spearheaded the overthrow of the al-Assad regime, takes control of the levers of government in a multi-confessional and multi-ethnic country populated by Kurds, Alawites, Druze, Shiites and Sunnis? This is in addition to the Christians who form an integral part of Syria's demographic fabric, as their ancestors were the first to embrace this religion and follow Jesus' teachings. The short answer is, it's too early to tell. As the rebels form their first provisional government free of the al-Assad family in more than five decades and a peaceful transfer of power takes place in which the country, the country now faces an immeasurably difficult task of healing the wounds of the civil war and turning the page on totalitarian rule.",

                    "description": "From a deep dive on a fatal space shuttle disaster to a study of a dozen iconic trees, these are our favorite titles this year",
                    "content": "This year, millions of viewers looked to the sky during a momentous day in April to view a stunning total solar eclipse . During select nights throughout the year, they gazed at spectacular auroras . As record heat spread over our planet again this year, Atlantic hurricanes fueled by warm waters hit the United States hard. And in Iceland, eruptions that spewed vibrant lava captivated audiences around the world. Aside from writing and editing stories about these events and others, our editors read a lot this year\u2014and so did our contributors. We asked our writers what books moved them the most, and they had plenty of suggestions. After a lot of back and forth, and a really hard time narrowing down the selections, we picked ten favorites. You can read reviews of these titles below\u2014which include works about whether the Earth is alive, our relationship to the moon, and how and why we remember. Plants surround us, yet their lives are so different from ours that even a dandelion can seem alien. Zoe\u0308 Schlanger\u2019s The Light Eaters looks beyond the leaves and branches to how our verdant neighbors perceive our world, offering a plant\u2019s eye view of life. \u201cNo one yet really knows the limits of what a plant can do,\u201d Schlanger writes early in the book, or even what plants truly are. Green life has often felt closer to the abiotic worlds of weather and geology, what we often lump under the broad label of \u201cnature.\u201d But Schlanger\u2019s conversations and explorations with botanists seek to understand plants on their own terms. Plant seeds, for example, don\u2019t only need soil, sun and water, but also have cells that are assessing the outside world and decide when the time is right for the new plant to begin emerging. Such a \u201cdecision-making center,\u201d Schlanger writes, was unknown until 2017. From such examples, The Light Eaters unfolds as an anthropology of plant life, exploring debate and discussion about what senses plants have and what they might discern. Ultimately, Schlanger acknowledges that the concept of plant intelligence remains contested. The Light Eaters nevertheless shines for exploring the question of whether plants can be said to communicate, have social lives and even move with intent. Schlanger\u2019s personal and curious quest to ask these questions is the core of the book, an effort to see what might be discovered if we look at plants as more than just houseplants and forests. \u201cPerhaps this amorphous quality of \u2018plant intelligence\u2019 I\u2019m trying to grasp,\u201d she writes, \u201cis as much to do with plant trying, plant testing, plant failing.\u201d \u2014Riley Black For millions of students across the United States, January 28, 1986, became an unsettling day they would remember vividly for the rest of their lives. Many sat in classrooms and auditoriums watching televisions to see the launch of Christa McAuliffe , the first teacher set to go to space, aboard the space shuttle Challenger . But just 73 seconds after liftoff, the craft lit up, broke apart and crashed down into the Atlantic Ocean, killing the seven people on board. The explosion replayed again and again on news coverage, leaving people of all ages wondering what happened and why. In Challenger , Adam Higginbotham answers those questions thoroughly in an engaging narrative. The book delves into the history of spaceflight\u2014including the prior Apollo 1 tragedy\u2014that led up to Challenger \u2019s fatal mission. Higginbotham brings readers into the lives of astronauts, engineers and bureaucrats involved with NASA\u2019s space program. He shares the stories of the crew members who died and the engineers who tried to warn higher-ups that launching Challenger on that cold January morning was not safe. Higginbotham details how the families reacted after the explosion, how whistleblowers and leakers made sure the truth was revealed, and how a 230-page report on the disaster came together. That report revealed the accident was a result, as Higginbotham writes, of \u201ccost cutting, faulty design, management blunders and institutional hubris.\u201d And yet, NASA did not entirely learn from that lesson, as Higginbotham details with the story of another fatal mishap, the 2003 disintegration of the shuttle Columbia , showing how history was once again doomed to repeat itself. \u2014 Joe Spring People who meet neuroscientist and psychologist Charan Ranganath tend to ask him the same question: \u201cWhy am I so forgetful?\u201d In Why We Remember , Ranganath turns that question on its head, drawing on 25 years of experience studying the mechanisms of human memory to explain how remarkable it is that we remember anything at all. We are designed, Ranganath writes, to forget. Malleability and flexibility were more useful than photographic accuracy to our ancestors navigating a constantly changing, dangerous world. Our brains are not memorization machines; they are thinking machines, optimized by evolution to help us survive. Using everyday examples\u2014losing your keys, failing to remember why you entered a room, forgetting the name of someone you just met at a conference\u2014and anecdotes from years of lab experiments, Ranganath explains exactly what\u2019s happening inside your brain when you form memories and try to recall them. We meet a cast of recurring characters\u2014the hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala\u2014and learn how these key players work together to wire the connections across our brains that make remembering possible. Memory is \u201cless like a photograph and more like a painting,\u201d he writes. Ranganath touches on hot-button issues\u2014how digital media affects memory, the root cause of \u201cbrain fog\u201d in long Covid, where neural networks fall short of mimicking human thinking\u2014but the book\u2019s key message is that, although we inevitably forget much throughout our lives, what we do remember defines who we are. \u201cMemory is much, much more than an archive of the past,\u201d Ranganath writes. \u201cIt is the prism through which we see ourselves, others and the world. It\u2019s the connective tissue underlying what we say, think and do.\u201d \u2014 Christian Elliott Welcome to the badass business of planetary defense, where scientists safeguard Earth from the threats of asteroid strikes. In How to Kill an Asteroid , Robin George Andrews chronicles the roughly three-decade-long existence of the field that gained fame with the DART mission , or the Double Asteroid Redirection Test, in 2022. During that mission, a sacrificial spacecraft bumped the asteroid Dimorphos from its original orbit as a demonstration of one of humankind\u2019s plans to deal with impending cosmic missiles. In the book, Andrews entwines two main suspenseful narratives. First, Andrews leans on the scientific research to describe the doomsday scenario that would result from an asteroid strike. Second, he details the nail-biting journey of DART sailing across space to meet its target, including some of the hiccups it faced that forced scientists to troubleshoot and problem-solve by the seat of their pants. As Andrews writes, asteroid deflection is the most successful tactic humanity has against asteroids. But planetary defense is about more than just deflection\u2014it also involves monitoring the heavens for suspicious-looking asteroids long before they reach Earth\u2019s doorstep. Unfortunately, Andrews notes, funding has been progressively cut for developing and maintaining tools such as asteroid-detecting observatories. With such insights, Andrews\u2019 book isn\u2019t just a thrilling read, but also an urgent call from the author for a reinvestment in planetary defense. \u2014Shi En Kim Daniel Levitin, a neuroscientist and musician whose 2006 book This Is Your Brain on Music spent more than a year on the New York Times best-seller list, has now turned his attention to the myriad ways in which music can help to heal our bodies and our minds. His new book, I Heard There Was a Secret Chord , looks at the ways music can help us cope with trauma and depression, relieve pain, strengthen our immune systems, and aid in the treatment of movement disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis and ALS. Even in the case of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, for which no cure currently exists, Levitin shows how music can loosen the disease\u2019s grip by relieving anxiety and agitation. Levitin has had personal relationships with many of the musicians whose stories he recounts. We hear for example, how he helped his longtime friend Joni Mitchell, who was hospitalized after suffering a brain aneurysm in 2015. On Levitin\u2019s instruction, Mitchell\u2019s nurses played a CD of tracks that she herself had previously cited as her favorites. It worked wonders, and her condition gradually improved. We also hear stories from Glen Campbell, Bruce Springsteen, Quincy Jones and others. These musicians\u2019 anecdotes give the book a warmth it might otherwise lack. Plenty of the book will appeal to both music fans and science buffs, but Levitin also recognizes that some degree of mystery will always surround music\u2019s ability to move us. He argues, for example, that part of music\u2019s appeal rests on its inherent ambiguity. Unlike books or movies, music doesn\u2019t have a narrative structure; rather, as Levitin puts it, music \u201coffers a dynamic interplay of sound, structure and meaning\u201d that our brains interpret moment by moment. \u201cUltimately,\u201d he writes, \u201cmusic can do so many things because it can mean so many things.\u201d \u2014 Dan Falk In What If We Get It Right? , marine biologist and policy expert Ayana Elizabeth Johnson presents interview transcripts, poems, factsheets and personal essays to discuss the many ways society has to reinvent itself to tackle the climate crisis. Johnson lets readers hear directly from activists, farmers, urban planners, artists, journalists and lawyers on myriad solutions. Climate change \u201ctouches all aspects of society,\u201d says Kendra Pierre-Louis, a climate journalist Johnson interviews in the book. Thus, fixing climate change, Johnson shows, calls for an all-hands-on-deck approach, because there\u2019s no silver bullet to this massive, multifaceted problem. Refreshingly, the book offers an optimistic outlook on our climate future. Society already has the tools to fix the climate, Johnson says, so she calls on readers to put pressure on the government to formalize and hasten the use of those tools in policy. Solving climate change might seem like an insurmountable challenge, but the book reminds readers that each of us can bring meaningful change by finding where our individual talents and passions intersect, and contributing in our own unique ways. \u2014 Shi En Kim Trees are \u201cthe heartbeat of the world,\u201d writes Daniel Lewis in Twelve Trees , his love letter to the ancient, life-giving beings with which we share this planet. In 12 chapters, each paired with a beautiful illustration, Lewis takes readers on an arboreal journey around the world and through time. The characters\u2014ebony, sandalwood, ceiba, redwood and so on\u2014quickly come to feel like old friends, their long life histories carefully told and the stakes of their uncertain futures in the Anthropocene clearly laid out. Each tree raises big questions\u2014how should conservationists balance the bulbous baobab\u2019s survival against that of the thirsty endangered elephants that destroy it for water? Is an invasive tree inherently bad, in a world so thoroughly transformed and reshuffled by humans? For instance, the non-native blue gum eucalyptus, omnipresent across California, is highly flammable, but it also provides critical habitat for the endangered monarch butterfly. Throughout the book, Lewis weaves in memoir, connecting his own roots with those of the trees he profiles. The toromiro , extinct on its home island of Rapa Nui but preserved in a diaspora of botanical collections around the world, reminds the author of his own migration from Hawaii to the mainland United States\u2014like a buoyant, salt-resistant seed on the waves. His experience as curator and historian at the famed Huntington Library comes in handy on a visit to an archive of another sort, the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research in Arizona\u2014where he comes face to face with Prometheus , a 5,062-year-old Great Basin bristlecone pine that gave its life to transform dendrochronologists\u2019 understanding of the ancient past. It\u2019s hard to read Twelve Trees , to flip through its wood-pulp pages, and not see the world differently after. Lewis puts it best: \u201cTrees are Earth\u2019s reporters, chronicling life and change over the long, elastic curve of history. All we need to do is listen up.\u201d \u2014 Christian Elliott In her debut book, Our Moon , Rebecca Boyle sheds new light on our familiar nighttime companion. Despite having a vast ground to cover, given the moon\u2019s 4.5-billion-year entwined history with Earth, Boyle writes with clarity and wonder. The book is part encyclopedia, part lunar biography and even part travelogue. In vivid detail, Boyle describes the sights and sensations that a person setting foot on the moon\u2019s dusty exterior would experience, thereby bringing the moon closer to readers than ever before. The book covers familiar ground, such as the Apollo missions that brought astronauts to the lunar surface. Yet readers will still find factoids that surprise: Scientists hypothesize that the moon coaxed prehistoric marine life to colonize land, for example. Culturally, humankind has the moon to thank for inspiring the birth of religions, helping civilizations keep time and tipping the outcomes of brutal wars. As humans draw up plans to return to the moon\u2014for scientific, geopolitical and economic reasons, Boyle notes\u2014this book reminds us that our celestial neighbor is part of our world, our culture and our identity, and always has been. \u2014 Shi En Kim Birds and whales sing, and vervet monkeys use alarm calls\u2014but only humans have full-blown symbolic language. How did we get here? In The Language Puzzle , archeologist Steven Mithen draws on the latest research from linguistics, anthropology, psychology and genetics to guide the reader through some 1.6 million years of hominin evolution. A comparison with the Neanderthals, with whom we shared large swaths of Europe and Asia for tens of thousands of years, offers some insight. Neanderthals buried their dead and likely had complex cultural rituals, but they never developed symbolic art, and they used the same kinds of stone tools for millennia\u2014perhaps, Mithen argues, due to their lack of linguistic ability, which in turn may stem from cognitive limitations. While Neanderthals may have been able to talk about what they could see in front of them, they likely had little or no capacity for abstract thought\u2014an ability that eventually gave our own species planet-changing powers. Mithen also discusses how language evolved from gestures, and he ponders what kinds of words were the first to appear. (So-called iconic words, which include onomatopoeias such as \u201cbang\u201d and \u201cquack\u201d and appear across cultures, may have been among the earliest.) He also looks at how language abilities are distributed in the brain, and the possible role that a genetic mutation may have played in giving Homo sapiens a linguistic edge over other hominins. Parts of The Language Puzzle , especially the chapters on human biological and cultural evolution, will be familiar to those who read Yuval Noah Harari\u2019s Sapiens or Leonard Mlodinow\u2019s The Upright Thinkers . Still, Mithen\u2019s detailed and engaging book, with its laser-like focus on the role of language, offers a fresh perspective on the human story. \u2014 Dan Falk In the 1960s, British scientist James Lovelock asserted something that was both familiar and novel: Earth, he theorized, was a living organism. While different religions and ancient cultures had described the planet as animate for eons, Lovelock\u2019s contemporaries in the scientific community were more apt to shun this notion, preferring a Darwinian stance that species adapted to their environments, but not vice versa. With the help of American biologist Lynn Margulis , however, Lovelock would develop and sustain the idea that organic and inorganic elements of the planet contributed to a global, self-regulating being. By the time Lovelock died in 2022, at the age of 103, different iterations of what became known as the Gaia hypothesis had gained supporters, while still attracting much skepticism. Science journalist Ferris Jabr\u2019s first book, Becoming Earth , is both a testament to and modern evolution of Lovelock\u2019s theory. Jabr accompanies scientists on research expeditions, zooming in and out on the world\u2019s diverse ecosystems to demonstrate how their occupants influence the environments around them. In the depths of a former mine in South Dakota, the journalist learns how microbes carve the Earth\u2019s crust. From the perilous peak of a 1,066-foot observatory tower in the Amazon, he sees how the rainforest creates clouds. Shifting environments, such as those affected by climate change, of course, force species to adapt. But Jabr details how that change doesn\u2019t always work in one direction. A kelp forest, for example, sequesters carbon and thus influences the atmosphere. \u201cAgain and again,\u201d Jabr writes, \u201clife and environment alter each other through feedback loops.\u201d Through precise reporting and lyrical reflections, Jabr\u2019s book explores a question as soulful as it is scientific: What does it mean to be alive? \u2014 Benjamin Cassidy",

                    "content": "During the last few years, Malta has witnessed a bewildering array of ethical revolutions, from civil rights to environmentalism to feminism. Often ignored is the rise of massive societal concern regarding animal treatment. It is easy to demonstrate the degree to which these concerns have seized the public\u2019s imagination. We have legislation in place relating to animal welfare and, hopefully, are at the stage of enacting pragmatic legislation to articulate animal rights and highlight owners\u2019 obligations. Parallel to this background, we are witnessing a large and persistent influx of both legal and illegal immigrants from outside the EU, contributing to an environment of vulnerability and abuse. Lately, we have been seeing an increase in the enforcement of animal welfare legislation, while on the other hand, we are seeing ineffective enforcement, sometimes lacking, of legislation regulating the status in all respects of both legal and illegal immigrants. Of course, in both situations, wherever the law fails to hold people accountable, crime will flourish. Failure to effectively address the third-country immigrant dilemma is creating and perpetuating an environment in which exploitation runs rampant. Trafficking is the recruitment and possible transport of persons within or across boundaries by force, fraud or deception for the purpose of exploiting them economically. Victims are lured by false promises of good jobs and better lives and then forced to work under brutal and inhuman conditions. Victims of trafficking are exploited for purposes of commercial sex, including prostitution, stripping, pornography, live sex shows, and other acts. However, trafficking also takes place as labour exploitation, including domestic servitude, the construction industry, agricultural work, and more. While anyone can become a victim of trafficking, third-country migrants are highly vulnerable to being trafficked due to a combination of factors, including a lack of legal status and protections, limited language skills and employment options, poverty and migration-related debts, and social isolation. They are often victimised by traffickers with the complicity of locals, on whom they may be dependent for employment or support in the foreign country. Seeking opportunities far better than those nightmares, they often fall victim to a flawed enforcement system. Human trafficking violates the promise that every person in Malta is guaranteed basic human rights. A critical strategy for ending human trafficking is better enforcement of our immigration and employment laws, and improved cooperation in law enforcement. While all the above is going on in our country with little public concern, our society\u2019s moral concern has outgrown the traditional ethic of animal cruelty. It has looked to its ethic for humans, appropriately modified, to find moral categories applicable to animals. This concept of legally encoded rights for animals is continually emerging as a plausible vehicle for reform. Many animal uses seen as frivolous by the public have been abolished without legislation. Toxicological testing of cosmetics on animals has been truncated. Zoos that are little more than prisons for animals have all but disappeared, and the very existence of zoos is being increasingly challenged, despite the public\u2019s unabashed love of seeing animals. Pet owners are seeing legislation impose even more stringent obligations on them. Inevitably, agriculture has felt the force of social concern with animal treatment. Indeed, it is arguable that contemporary concern in society with the treatment of farm animals in modern production systems blazed the trail leading to a new ethic for animals. Questions of animal welfare are at least partly \u201cought\u201d questions, questions of ethical obligation. The concept of animal welfare is an ethical concept to which, once understood, science brings relevant data. When we ask about an animal\u2019s or a person\u2019s welfare, we ask about what we owe the animal and to what extent. The only exception in Malta, it seems, is with regard to immigrants hailing from countries outside the EU. We accept or bring them here not to be protected but to exploit them to the fullest. Immigrant women are very often employed in the area of domestic or care work. In Malta, their presence in this sector is very important, making them particularly susceptible to abuse and exploitation. Domestic and care workers are a gendered segment of labour migration that is still strongly divided along a gender binary through the sexual division of roles and labour, and is directly associated with the sphere of the welfare state. Migrant women in the caregiving and domestic sectors are one of the least protected work groups under our laws. For a long time, waged domestic work has not been regarded as \u201cactual\u201d work, as it revolves around natural tasks that women perform in the household. The domestic work sector has recently responded to the unions\u2019 call to regulate the presence of immigrant workers in areas where there is an important presence of severe exploitation. It is imperative that our authorities address the growing undeclared irregular work and the large numbers of undocumented immigrants that can often suffer from severe exploitation, at times brutal. The vulnerability of these people is not a quality that inheres in them but is instead the product of our political, economic and cultural forces acting along a variety of identity axes, including gender, race and nationality, that disempower specific sets of immigrants in particular ways. We must protect the interests of the individual that we consider essential to being human and to human nature from being submerged, even at a time when animal rights are being rapidly enhanced.

                    "content": "\u2018I\u2019ve had death threats\u2019: how schools deal with social media fallout Molly, 20, started using social media as a teenager. On Instagram , and sometimes TikTok , she shares her views on LGBT issues, mental health and climate change. \u201cI\u2019ve been one of many voices advocating for reform of the sex education curriculum,\u201d Molly says. \u201cI like social media because it brings communities together to speak out, and can help us feel less alone.\u201d But, as far back as their teenage years, Molly \u2013 who is non-binary and uses the pronoun \u201cthey\u201d \u2013 has been subjected to a torrent of abuse online. \u201cAfter I voiced my opinion on reform of queer sex education, I woke up one morning to 2,000 comments. By the time the comments are taken down \u2013 if at all \u2013 they\u2019ve already been read. I\u2019ve had memes made about me for being non-binary. I\u2019ve been doxxed, with my personal details published, which could allow people to find me in real life. I have had death threats,\u201d Molly says. \u201cWhen I went to the debs\u2019 ball in a yellow suit and with rainbow eyebrows \u2013 basically, a drag make-up look \u2013 I posted it on TikTok, and the comments were relentless. People have even trawled into my family\u2019s life and made personal comments about my parents. At times it was relentless and it took a toll on my family.\u201d While people are entitled to disagree and express their opinion, Molly says lines are regularly crossed, and points out that they were a child when much of this happened. So, why stay online? \u201cIf I stop being online they win. And I don\u2019t want to be silenced. I want people to understand me,\u201d Molly says. \u201cIt still happens, and I know that more may come from speaking out. It hasn\u2019t put me off, but I think that big tech companies should do more to protect young people online.\u201d Molly was among the speakers at the People\u2019s Inquiry into Digital Harms \u2013 an event run by Uplift , a progressive non-profit organisation, in November 2024, which heard testimony from people of all ages about how online hatred, disinformation and toxicity affects their lives. The day also featured a panel discussion from experts and policymakers. [ Digital damage: \u2018It often felt like Big Tech didn\u2019t want me to be a functional person\u2019 Opens in new window ] One mother spoke of how her two children, who are mixed race and have brown skin, have been increasingly targeted by young boys who are fans of Andrew Tate , a self-described misogynist. She also worries about the \u201cbombardment\u201d of her daughters with image-based products. \u201cIt\u2019s all or nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cDo I cut them off from communicating with their friends or, despite my best efforts, have them bombarded with harmful content and ads? We need more regulation, especially of advertising to children.\u201d All of this comes as increasing evidence shows that many social media algorithms increasingly push misogynistic content at boys and young men, while girls are often targeted with stories designed to make them feel bad about themselves and their body image. Many youngsters are being targeted by content that romanticises suicide . Even children who do not have phones are being exposed to pornography and sexual violence that distorts their view of normal sex and intimacy. [ Teenage boys \u2018bombarded\u2019 with misogynist content within minutes of signing up to TikTok and YouTube Shorts Opens in new window ] These recommender algorithms are designed by big corporations who want to keep young people online for as long as possible in order to advertise more and more to them by artificially amplifying whatever will engage \u2013 or enrage \u2013 users. Children are also being groomed online, even on the seemingly child-friendly app, Roblox. And the proliferation of conspiracy theories and misinformation can make it increasingly difficult to tell truth from fiction. [ Roblox and YouTube main sources of online content which \u2018bothered or upset\u2019 primary school children - report Opens in new window ] Just over a quarter (25 per cent) of primary schoolchildren (aged 8-12) and one-fifth (21 per cent) of secondary schoolchildren (aged 12-14) have been bothered or upset by harmful content such as scams, harassment, horror, and sexual material online, according to figures published in CyberSafeKids \u2019 annual trends and usage report, Left To Their Own Devices . More and more, teachers are having to deal with the fallout in the classroom. So, how can we address this stream of intentionally divisive and harmful content? A recently reviewed social, personal and health education (SPHE) curriculum places greater focus on media literacy, but Alex Cooney, founder and chief executive of CyberSafeKids , says it is peripheral and dependent on teachers\u2019 ability and level of comfort with the topic. \u201cThere are also a number of external organisations \u2013 including ourselves \u2013 which deliver talks to parents, young people, teachers and youth workers, but these don\u2019t have a dedicated budget and are at the discretion of the school. And we\u2019re often called in after there has been an issue in a school,\u201d she says. \u201cParents think, and often say, that my child is not seeing anything like this online, but unfortunately it\u2019s not about if they see it, it\u2019s about when .\u201d Cooney does not advocate for bans or shutting down social media. \u201cWe want to ensure that children can both benefit and thrive online. We just want this to be safe, in the same way that safety is paramount in playground design. The internet was designed by adults, for adults, but a third of global users are children. And we need media literacy to be core to the curriculum, embedded into different subjects through critical thinking,\u201d she says. \u201cThe approach needs consistency and it needs, just like with cars and driving, to be safety-focused. The difference is that the road industry has bought into user safety, and even competes on who has the safest car. The tech industry, however, is not doing this.\u201d Cooney points to the example of Finland, which began to grapple with this problem as far back as 2014 after recognising that Russia was engaged in election interference. \u201c They decided to upskill all citizens, with a \u2018cradle to the grave\u2019 approach, on critical thinking skills so that everyone could engage critically with all media content. They have, subsequently, topped media literacy lists year after year. We are a small country too, and we could do the same,\u201d she says. This is just one way of bringing about change, Cooney says; regulation and parental education are hugely important, too. Siobha\u0301n O\u2019Donoghue, co-founder and director of Uplift, agrees that a focus on digital literacy in schools is like \u201ctrying to close the stable door after the horse has bolted\u201d. \u201cWhile digital literacy is important, young people are already quite digitally literate. What they need is not to be sold disinformation and hate,\u201d she says. [ Children are not safe anywhere online. It\u2019s time to hit tech companies in the bottom line Opens in new window ] \u201cA handful of corporations are manipulating these tools that we use to communicate, connect, organise our lives, learn, shop, work, and access information and news, for their private profit. Algorithms should be turned off by default, and there should be greater transparency on how they work. We need to properly resource the trusted flagger recently established by Comisiu\u0301n na Mea\u0301n [the new media regulator]. Otherwise, it won\u2019t work.\u201d Tanya O\u2019Carroll, a tech policy expert and co-founder of People vs Big Tech , an organisation campaigning for a safer and less exploitative internet, says there is a version of a digital world which can support children to explore their identity and the world around them. \u201cWhy are we expecting individuals to solve the problems of the state?\u201d she asks. \u201cThe State has failed to stop private companies from exploiting us. We need brave leadership and policies. And we need to reimagine the role of tech in our lives \u2013 and ensure regulation removes these companies\u2019 exploitative practices.\u201d",

                    "content": ", we had already detected a pattern: The pressure to act stereotypically masculine predicts aggression in young adult men in the U.S., particularly when they feel like their manhood is under threat. So we started to wonder \u2013 OK, well, when does this pattern start? We thought about age. But age is somewhat of a rough predictor of development, right? It\u2019s just a number. Although age corresponds with social changes, such as changing schools and navigating new social situations, boys go through puberty at different ages. For example, changes in secondary sex characteristics, such as height, body type and voice \u2013 these are going to affect how other people treat you. As boys\u2019 bodies start changing, there\u2019s going to be much more of an expectation for them to act in stereotypically masculine ways, just like adult men do. . You\u2019re able to grasp social pressures with much more nuance than you could before. And part of that is realizing, \u201cOh shoot, if I don\u2019t defend my manhood, then I won\u2019t have friends, I won\u2019t fit in, my parents might disapprove.\u201d In our research, puberty captured these nuances better than age. Age did predict these things, but puberty was just a much stronger predictor. Half of the participants were threatened and the other half were not, at random. We had everyone take two quizzes: a \u201cBoy Questions Quiz\u201d and a \u201cGirls Question Quiz.\u201d For the half whose masculinity we threatened, we would tell them they did poorly on the guys quiz \u2013 \u201cWell, you missed more questions than other guys usually do. Based on your quiz results, it seems like you\u2019re more like the average girl than the average guy.\u201d This was age-adapted from past work on masculinity threats to adults, because we wanted to be able to build on those findings. This measure has been used in , so we wanted our findings to directly align with that work. That research and others have found that this task is associated with actual violent behavior. However, we tried to be very careful to say that we weren\u2019t measuring aggressive behavior. Think of cognition as a first step. People who are thinking aggressively are going to be more likely to act violently or aggressively. Not everyone who is thinking aggressively is going to act on it, but cognition can predict it. This measure is also great because it\u2019s implicit \u2013 our participants didn\u2019t know that we were measuring aggression. They were simply given this word completion task, which we presented as a game, and how they performed indicated how aggressively they were thinking in the moment. Yes. We asked boys to respond to statements like, \u201cMy parents would be upset if they saw me acting like a girl.\u201d And we found that this fear of upsetting their parents indicated whether they would endorse statements such as, \u201cI\u2019m like other guys because I want other people to like me.\u201d We also found that a fear of upsetting peers could pressure certain boys to feel as if they needed to \u201cact like a man.\u201d We just didn\u2019t have data from peers to look at. So we couldn\u2019t really try to understand, within peer groups, what exactly was going on. We did, however, have data from parents, including the types of beliefs about masculinity that they endorsed, as well as certain social and demographic variables reported by parents. There\u2019s research showing that people who are under more economic stress \u2013 who experience economic hardship \u2013 more readily . This work has argued that poverty leads to stereotyping because high-status people are motivated to maintain the status quo when they believe that their position in society is threatened. Or this could be an example of : The greater your anxiety over paying the bills, the less you\u2019re going to be able to ponder gender and race. We observed that working-class parents were more likely to endorse these rigid, masculine ideas, especially about men being strong, powerful and dominant over people of other genders. And they\u2019re the ones whose sons reported the most pressure to be stereotypically masculine. And I think economic anxiety and poverty are a key part of this story. In times of prosperity, or in societies that are more socialist in their orientation \u2013 where you\u2019re guaranteed basic health care and education, for example \u2013 do men feel less pressure to be on top, because they feel more economically and socially secure? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s an interesting avenue for future research. I think we, in academia, expected Gen Z to really just go all in for Harris, and it just doesn\u2019t seem to be like that\u2019s the case, especially among Gen Z men who are working class. You saw this play out when Trump appeared on several podcasts whose hosts lean into that strong, macho persona, . In our two studies, we found that pressures to be masculine can predict aggressive responses among boys in later adolescence and young men \u2013 times of their lives when they are really trying to figure out what kind of man they will be in their relationships, at work and in their day-to-day lives. Coupled with rising economic uncertainties, these celebrities and politicians can give these men an outlet to demonstrate their masculinity, burnish their status and make them feel like they belong. I think it\u2019s all wrapped up in that. Men start experiencing these pressures to be the provider in their family, to get their relationships and careers going, to make their way up the ladder at work. A lot of these goals are becoming more difficult to attain. And so what we\u2019re seeing is that in order to gain that status \u2013 or even out of fear of losing that status if they have it \u2013 boys and men will go to great lengths. Obviously, aligning with people \u2013 celebrities, politicians, business leaders \u2013 who have those same values will become more enticing. We don\u2019t have great measures of peers or other factors like that. But we do have this measure where we asked parents for their ZIP codes, and we mapped that to the proportion of support for Trump in 2020, so not this past election. And we saw that it wasn\u2019t necessarily parents\u2019 self-reported political identity \u2013 so how liberal or conservative they are \u2013 that predicted their masculinity beliefs. It was this county-level, community-level variable. So if you think about that finding, you would imagine that it\u2019s not just the \u201cphysical counties\u201d that boys are in. Digital spaces \u2013 social media spaces that boys are living in \u2013 are probably having an effect, too. Remember, during late puberty, teens are trying out different identities. For whatever reason, some of these more conservative online spaces have become really appealing to certain boys and men. There is definitely some important in this area, . These pressures to be stereotypically masculine come from parents, peers and the community. And they don\u2019t seem to be changing or dissipating as quickly as we in academia thought they might. For example, you might think of Gen Z as this liberal group that\u2019s super into social justice. And that just doesn\u2019t seem to be the case, especially among certain men and boys from working class backgrounds. So I think we should be a lot more attuned to that lack of change \u2013 the social and economic sources of these pressures, how to address them, and what they mean not just for voting behavior but also for some of .",

                    "content": "The 26-year-old man arrested Monday and questioned in the killing of the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare on the streets of New York once worked for a Santa Monica, California, company and spent time at Stanford University, records show. After an intensive manhunt, Luigi Mangione was taken into custody by law enforcement in Pennsylvania on Monday on suspicion of killing Brian Thompson, 50, in an early-morning ambush last week. At a news conference announcing the arrest, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said Mangione was born and raised in Maryland, had ties to California and that his last known address was in Honolulu. A shackled Mangione was seen in video stepping out of an SUV on Monday afternoon and being led by deputies into a Pennsylvania courthouse. The arrest came after what police described as a significant use of police resources, including combing through thousands of hours of video, reviewing hundreds of tips, DNA testing, fingerprint analysis, drones and aviation canvasses, that for days appeared to yield no results. Then a tip from someone at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania, broke open the case, Kenny said. Altoona Police Department officers found Mangione seated at the fast-food chain wearing a blue medical mask and looking at a silver laptop, according to a criminal complaint. After asking him to remove his mask, they immediately recognized him as the shooting suspect. When they asked Mangione if he had been in New York recently, he became quiet and started to shake, according to the complaint. At a news conference Monday, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro praised the person at the restaurant who spotted the suspect and contacted law enforcement. \u201cI want to ask all of our fellow Pennsylvanians to demonstrate the same type of thoughtfulness and courage and smarts as the individual at McDonald\u2019s did this morning and help law enforcement here in Pennsylvania as we continue with our investigation,\u201d Shapiro said. The chief also responded to online reaction to the suspect and the killing of Thompson. In social media posts, some have praised the killing and criticized the role of companies such as UnitedHealthcare in the health care industry. \u201cI have no tolerance or should anyone for one man using an illegal ghost gun to murder someone because he thinks his opinion matters the most,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cHear me on this. He is no hero.\u201d Detectives obtained a handwritten, three-page document from Mangione when he was taken into custody that appeared to outline his motives for the killing, Kenny said. Officials declined to discuss the contents of the letter but said Mangione appeared to have \u201csome ill will toward corporate America.\u201d Mangione was charged in Pennsylvania with five criminal counts, including forgery, carrying a firearm without a license, tampering with records or identification, possessing instruments of a crime and providing false identification to law enforcement. He was denied bond and was set to be transferred to a state correctional facility Monday night. NYPD detectives went to Pennsylvania on Monday to speak with Mangione. Officials were also reviewing his social media activity. According to public records, Mangione spent time at Stanford University in 2019 and once worked for the Santa Monica company TrueCar, a digital marketplace for automobiles. A spokesperson for Stanford confirmed that a person named Luigi Mangione was employed as a head counselor under the Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies program between May and September 2019, and a Truecar spokesperson confirmed Mangione worked for the company and left sometime in 2023. A former co-worker at Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies said Mangione seemed like a \u201creally nice, goofy guy\u201d during their time there. They asked not to be identified, as they had not spoken for several years. Few details were available about Mangione\u2019s time in California, but New York police noted a connection to the San Francisco area when announcing the break in the case. His time in other parts of the country was more widely available. Before Stanford, he studied computer science at the University of Pennsylvania, online profiles show. His LinkedIn and Github profiles reflected an entrepreneurial streak: Mangione founded a video game club and later a startup developing games. Mangione was the class valedictorian in 2016 at Gilman School, a private all-boys school in Baltimore, according to The Baltimore Sun. Race Saunders, who graduated from Gilman with Mangione, described him as \u201ca great friend\u201d and a \u201csmart guy and kind, as well.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think this was a mental breakdown,\u201d Saunders said in a text message. \u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate, I\u2019m sure he will speak for himself.\u201d Mangione posted extensively in favor of experimentation with psychedelic drugs on social media and pontificated on trends in tech. According to an archived page of Mangione\u2019s Facebook profile, which was removed as of Monday, he co-founded a company called AppRoar Studios. He also worked as a UI programming intern at Firaxis Games from 2015 to 2017 in Maryland. Mangione\u2019s LinkedIn profile shows that he once volunteered for Lorien Health Systems, an assisted-living facility for elderly people in Maryland, in 2014, when he was still in high school. Mangione is the grandson of Nicholas Mangione, a real estate developer who owned nursing homes and country clubs in Maryland. Mangione\u2019s grandfather died in 2008 from complications of a stroke. Mangione is also the cousin of Republican Delegate Nino Mangione in Baltimore County, a spokesperson for the politician confirmed to media outlets. On Goodreads, he reviewed 13 books, including the Unabomber\u2019s manifesto. He appeared to empathize with some of Theodore Kaczynski\u2019s writings, based on the review he provided on the site. \u201cWhile these actions tend to be characterized as those of a crazy luddite,\u201d he wrote in February, \u201cthey are more accurately seen as those of an extreme political revolutionary. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to quickly and thoughtless write this off as the manifesto of a lunatic, in order to avoid facing some of the uncomfortable problems it identifies. But it\u2019s simply impossible to ignore how prescient many of his predictions about modern society turned out.\u201d He then copied in a comment from Reddit about the manifesto in which a commenter wrote: \u201cWhen all other forms of communication fail, violence is necessary to survive.\u201d When Altoona police responded to McDonald\u2019s based on the tip they\u2019d received from an employee, the suspect was acting suspiciously, carrying fraudulent IDs, and a firearm and suppressor that were \u201cconsistent\u201d with the weapon used in the killing, said New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch. The weapon was described as a ghost handgun capable of firing 9mm bullets, police said. Ghost guns are unserialized and mostly difficult to trace. They are at times purchased by individuals as kits, using unfinished frames and receivers and, other times, created with 3-D printers. Law enforcement sources said Mangione was carrying bullets, a loaded magazine, and a large amount of cash. The weapon that was seized when he was detained contained 3-D-made parts, including a 3-D-printed silencer. Officers also recovered clothing and masks believed to have been used by the suspect, she said. According to the criminal complaint, Mangione initially handed Altoona police officers a fake driver\u2019s license bearing the name Mark Rosario with a date of birth of July 21, 1998. Officers ran the name through the National Crime Information Center and found no record. They then informed Mangione that he was under an official police investigation and would be placed under arrest if he lied about his identity. He then stated that his true name was Luigi Mangione with a birth date of May 6, 1998. When asked why he lied about his name, he said, \u201cI clearly shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d according to the complaint. CNN reported that police found a document when making the arrest in which the suspect allegedly railed against the health care system. \u201cThese parasites had it coming,\u201d CNN reported the document as saying. \u201cI do apologize for any strife and trauma, but it had to be done.\u201d The Los Angeles Times could not confirm the document or its origins. A review of Mangione\u2019s posts on X suggest a center-right worldview. \u00a92024 Los Angeles Times. Visit at latimes.com . Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

But it\u2019s simply impossible to ignore how prescient many of his predictions about modern society turned out.\u201d He then copied in a comment from Reddit about the manifesto in which a commenter wrote: \u201cWhen all other forms of communication fail, violence is necessary to survive.\u201d When Altoona police responded to McDonald\u2019s based on the tip they\u2019d received from an employee, the suspect was acting suspiciously, carrying fraudulent IDs, and a firearm and suppressor that were \u201cconsistent\u201d with the weapon used in the killing, said New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch. The weapon was described as a ghost handgun capable of firing 9mm bullets, police said. Ghost guns are unserialized and mostly difficult to trace. They are at times purchased by individuals as kits, using unfinished frames and receivers and, other times, created with 3-D printers. Law enforcement sources said Mangione was carrying bullets, a loaded magazine, and a large amount of cash. The weapon that was seized when he was detained contained 3-D-made parts, including a 3-D-printed silencer. Officers also recovered clothing and masks believed to have been used by the suspect, she said. According to the criminal complaint, Mangione initially handed Altoona police officers a fake driver\u2019s license bearing the name Mark Rosario with a date of birth of July 21, 1998. Officers ran the name through the National Crime Information Center and found no record. They then informed Mangione that he was under an official police investigation and would be placed under arrest if he lied about his identity. He then stated that his true name was Luigi Mangione with a birth date of May 6, 1998. When asked why he lied about his name, he said, \u201cI clearly shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d according to the complaint. CNN reported that police found a document when making the arrest in which the suspect allegedly railed against the health care system. \u201cThese parasites had it coming,\u201d CNN reported the document as saying. \u201cI do apologize for any strife and trauma, but it had to be done.\u201d The Los Angeles Times could not confirm the document or its origins.

                    "content": "The 26-year-old man arrested Monday and questioned in the killing of the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare on the streets of New York once worked for a Santa Monica, California, company and spent time at Stanford University, records show. After an intensive manhunt, Luigi Mangione was taken into custody by law enforcement in Pennsylvania on Monday on suspicion of killing Brian Thompson, 50, in an early-morning ambush last week. At a news conference announcing the arrest, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said Mangione was born and raised in Maryland, had ties to California and that his last known address was in Honolulu. A shackled Mangione was seen in video stepping out of an SUV on Monday afternoon and being led by deputies into a Pennsylvania courthouse. The arrest came after what police described as a significant use of police resources, including combing through thousands of hours of video, reviewing hundreds of tips, DNA testing, fingerprint analysis, drones and aviation canvasses, that for days appeared to yield no results. Then a tip from someone at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania, broke open the case, Kenny said. Altoona Police Department officers found Mangione seated at the fast-food chain wearing a blue medical mask and looking at a silver laptop, according to a criminal complaint. After asking him to remove his mask, they immediately recognized him as the shooting suspect. When they asked Mangione if he had been in New York recently, he became quiet and started to shake, according to the complaint. At a news conference Monday, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro praised the person at the restaurant who spotted the suspect and contacted law enforcement. \u201cI want to ask all of our fellow Pennsylvanians to demonstrate the same type of thoughtfulness and courage and smarts as the individual at McDonald\u2019s did this morning and help law enforcement here in Pennsylvania as we continue with our investigation,\u201d Shapiro said. The chief also responded to online reaction to the suspect and the killing of Thompson. In social media posts, some have praised the killing and criticized the role of companies such as UnitedHealthcare in the health care industry. \u201cI have no tolerance or should anyone for one man using an illegal ghost gun to murder someone because he thinks his opinion matters the most,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cHear me on this. He is no hero.\u201d Detectives obtained a handwritten, three-page document from Mangione when he was taken into custody that appeared to outline his motives for the killing, Kenny said. Officials declined to discuss the contents of the letter but said Mangione appeared to have \u201csome ill will toward corporate America.\u201d Mangione was charged in Pennsylvania with five criminal counts, including forgery, carrying a firearm without a license, tampering with records or identification, possessing instruments of a crime and providing false identification to law enforcement. He was denied bond and was set to be transferred to a state correctional facility Monday night. NYPD detectives went to Pennsylvania on Monday to speak with Mangione. Officials were also reviewing his social media activity. According to public records, Mangione spent time at Stanford University in 2019 and once worked for the Santa Monica company TrueCar, a digital marketplace for automobiles. A spokesperson for Stanford confirmed that a person named Luigi Mangione was employed as a head counselor under the Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies program between May and September 2019, and a Truecar spokesperson confirmed Mangione worked for the company and left sometime in 2023. A former co-worker at Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies said Mangione seemed like a \u201creally nice, goofy guy\u201d during their time there. They asked not to be identified, as they had not spoken for several years. Few details were available about Mangione\u2019s time in California, but New York police noted a connection to the San Francisco area when announcing the break in the case. His time in other parts of the country was more widely available. Before Stanford, he studied computer science at the University of Pennsylvania, online profiles show. His LinkedIn and Github profiles reflected an entrepreneurial streak: Mangione founded a video game club and later a startup developing games. Mangione was the class valedictorian in 2016 at Gilman School, a private all-boys school in Baltimore, according to The Baltimore Sun. Race Saunders, who graduated from Gilman with Mangione, described him as \u201ca great friend\u201d and a \u201csmart guy and kind, as well.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think this was a mental breakdown,\u201d Saunders said in a text message. \u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate, I\u2019m sure he will speak for himself.\u201d Mangione posted extensively in favor of experimentation with psychedelic drugs on social media and pontificated on trends in tech. According to an archived page of Mangione\u2019s Facebook profile, which was removed as of Monday, he co-founded a company called AppRoar Studios. He also worked as a UI programming intern at Firaxis Games from 2015 to 2017 in Maryland. Mangione\u2019s LinkedIn profile shows that he once volunteered for Lorien Health Systems, an assisted-living facility for elderly people in Maryland, in 2014, when he was still in high school. Mangione is the grandson of Nicholas Mangione, a real estate developer who owned nursing homes and country clubs in Maryland. Mangione\u2019s grandfather died in 2008 from complications of a stroke. Mangione is also the cousin of Republican Delegate Nino Mangione in Baltimore County, a spokesperson for the politician confirmed to media outlets. On Goodreads, he reviewed 13 books, including the Unabomber\u2019s manifesto. He appeared to empathize with some of Theodore Kaczynski\u2019s writings, based on the review he provided on the site. \u201cWhile these actions tend to be characterized as those of a crazy luddite,\u201d he wrote in February, \u201cthey are more accurately seen as those of an extreme political revolutionary. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to quickly and thoughtless write this off as the manifesto of a lunatic, in order to avoid facing some of the uncomfortable problems it identifies. But it\u2019s simply impossible to ignore how prescient many of his predictions about modern society turned out.\u201d He then copied in a comment from Reddit about the manifesto in which a commenter wrote: \u201cWhen all other forms of communication fail, violence is necessary to survive.\u201d When Altoona police responded to McDonald\u2019s based on the tip they\u2019d received from an employee, the suspect was acting suspiciously, carrying fraudulent IDs, and a firearm and suppressor that were \u201cconsistent\u201d with the weapon used in the killing, said New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.

                    "content": "From a showdown between Italian and English giants fighting for a top-eight spot to Dortmund aiming to break their poor run against Barcelona\u2019s Hansi Flick, Gulf News brings you all the key storylines ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Champions League action. When UEFA revamped this season\u2019s Champions League, they promised more high-stakes clashes in the early stages - and Wednesday evening delivers with a heavyweight showdown as Borussia Dortmund host Barcelona. Both teams come into the match level on 12 points, with Barcelona in third place and Dortmund just behind in fourth. With eight teams separated by just two points, this encounter could prove pivotal in the race to finish inside the top eight and secure an automatic spot in the knockout stages. Dortmund, still seeking their first competitive win over Barcelona, boast an unbeaten home record across all competitions this season, a statistic they\u2019ll hope to extend against the Catalan giants. Barcelona, meanwhile, are aiming to bounce back from a frustrating 2-2 draw with Real Betis over the weekend, a game where the La Liga leaders twice let their lead slip. Their recent form has been inconsistent, with two wins, two draws and two losses in their last six outings. History, however, favours the five-time Champions League winners. Manager Hansi Flick has a flawless record against Dortmund, having won all five of his previous encounters. If that trend continues, Barcelona will leave Signal Iduna Park with all three points and all but secure their spot in the last 16. After ending their seven-game winless streak with a victory over Nottingham Forest last week, Manchester City were unable to make it two wins on the bounce, settling for a draw against Crystal Palace over the weekend. Pep Guardiola\u2019s side will hope this doesn\u2019t signal the start of another slump as they prepare for a crucial trip to Italy on Wednesday night to face Juventus. The match is surely a must-win if City are to keep their hopes of a top-eight finish alive and secure automatic qualification for the Champions League knockout stages. Currently sitting 17th in the standings, City are two points behind the top eight after a rocky campaign that included a humbling 4-1 defeat to Sporting Lisbon and a 3-3 draw with Feyenoord - where they surrendered a three-goal lead in the final 15 minutes. Guardiola\u2019s team have already set some unwanted records during their earlier winless streak, and another could be added in Turin if they concede two or more goals. Remarkably, Guardiola has never overseen a side that conceded two or more goals in three consecutive Champions League matches during his illustrious career. City may take some encouragement from Juventus\u2019 struggles, as Thiago Motta\u2019s side find themselves in a similar position, level on points with City but two places lower in the standings. The Old Lady are winless in their last three European outings but can take heart from their unbeaten record in their last five meetings with City. However, if Guardiola\u2019s men manage to break their streak and secure their first victory in six attempts against the Italian giants, it would mark just the second time this century that Juventus have suffered back-to-back home defeats in the Champions League. Arsenal and Monaco, both clubs once managed by Arse\u0300ne Wenger, face off in Europe for the third time on Wednesday evening, each boasting identical Champions League records this season: three wins, one draw, and one loss. Those results place both teams inside the top eight heading into the gameweek, with Arsenal in seventh and Monaco in eighth, each on 10 points and five behind leaders Liverpool. Historically, this matchup has favoured the away side. Monaco secured a memorable 3-1 win over the Gunners at the Emirates in 2015, and while Arsenal triumphed 2-0 in the return leg, it wasn\u2019t enough to prevent their elimination from the Champions League at the round of 16 stage. That trend may change on Wednesday, as Mikel Arteta\u2019s Arsenal have been formidable at the Emirates, winning six of their last seven Champions League matches on home soil, including victories over French sides Lens and Paris Saint-Germain. Monaco, on the other hand, have struggled for consistency on the road in Europe. Their 1-0 win over Bologna on matchday four ended an eight-game winless streak in away European fixtures, but they have not managed consecutive away wins in the competition since that triumph over Arsenal. With Arsenal\u2019s strong home form and Monaco\u2019s patchy away record, the signs point to the Gunners maintaining their top-eight position and securing another vital win in their pursuit of a first ever Champions League trophy.",

                    "content": "Seven BPS schools will launch new multilingual education programs in the 2025-2026 school year, the district announced Monday, marking the largest single-year surge in BPS\u2019s language offerings. \u201cApproval of the new programs is a critical step for our district in our efforts to serve our Multilingual Learners,\u201d Superintendent Mary Skipper said Monday. \u201cThe development of these programs reflects our commitment to centering students\u2019 identities and leveraging their home languages to accelerate their learning in school.\u201d The new bilingual education programs, approved by DESE earlier this month, will be spread across five elementary schools and two secondary schools, serving English language learners. BPS officials said they developed the proposals after a community-engagement process through the last school year. In the 2025-2026 school year, over 200 students will have access to the programs, BPS officials said, and capacity is expected to expand by 30% in each subsequent year. About one-third of BPS students are English learners, the district estimates. The unprecedented expansion in these programs follows the districts launch of a \u201cInclusive Education Plan in the fall of 2023, which controversially proposed moving the majority of English learners to general education classrooms. Eight members of the district\u2019s English Learners Task Force resigned in protest of the plan. The Blackstone and Philbrick/Sumner will have dual language programs in which classes are taught in English and Spanish and students receive a \u201cSeal of Biliteracy\u201d upon high school graduation. Quincy Elementary will have a bilingual education program, in which math is taught in Mandarin and students must take a Mandarin language course. The McKay will have a transitional bilingual education program, in which multilingual students begin classes primarily in Spanish and transition to English as their proficiency develops. TechBoston Academy, Ohrenberger and English High School will have \u201cnewcomer\u201d programs aiding recently immigrated multilingual learners, with instruction primarily in English but \u201cspecific techniques\u201d to make beginner level Math, Science, and Social Studies content accessible to the students. The programs \u201crepresent hope for our English learner students,\u201d Boston School Committee member Rafaela Polanco Garcia said, noting that they \u201cwill benefit only a small portion of our student population in their first year\u201d but expand each year. In the elementary schools, three programs will be implemented for K1 students and the McKay program will be implemented in K2. The elementary programs will grow to include the next grade up each year until the program includes the whole school.

Gemalto installed biometric gates at KIA in 2018 under an $18 million contract, prior to becoming Thales. But as a World Bank document from 2019 shows, the e-gates needed to be moved from Terminal 2 to Terminal 3, adding several million dollars more to the project\u2019s overall cost. Margins Group has also worked with Gemalto (Thales) on smart cards for the banking industry.Margins Group makes the new Ghana Card, which functions as a travel document in some situations, and therefore will be read by the biometric gates. The gates scan the travellers\u2019 ID document to open a first set of doors, and perform a biometric match to open a second set, similar to models made by Thales.Bright Simons, VP of think tank Imani Africa, writes for MyjoyOnline.com that Thales completed an installation of gates in 2020, and that the total project cost has ballooned to $240 million.\u201cThe global travel landscape is evolving rapidly, with innovations such as biometric e-gates and Digital Travel Credentials becoming the new standard. Ghana has embraced these global advancements, integrating biometric verification and Digital Travel Credential technologies into a single platform,\u201d the VP said during the launching ceremony as reported on his website.\u201cThis dual capability positions Ghana as a pioneer in intelligent border control, aligning with global standards while placing us ahead of many advanced nations.\u201dBawumia, who lost the race to become Ghana\u2019s next president following Saturday\u2019s elections, said the newly unveiled e-gates are designed with \u201ccutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, biometrics, and real-time data processing to create a frictionless and secure travel experience.\u201dUnderscoring the importance of the new system for Ghanaians and foreign travellers, the VP said it will lead to faster clearance at border points, ensure smooth entry into the country, ensuing a seamless and hassle-free experience.Bawumia said novelties like these find their relevance in other digital transformation projects the country has successfully implemented such as the Ghana Card which today makes it easy for the country to integrate digital services. The Ghana card, by the way, is also used as a travel document by Ghanaians.\u201cThe Ghana Card has also become a critical tool for national security, supporting law enforcement and other agencies. Notably, the Ghana Card was recognized by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as a valid e-passport card. Since this recognition, Ghanaians have been able to travel to Ghana, across 197 countries and access over 44,000 airports worldwide with just their Ghana Card,\u201d Bawumia recalled.He assured that Ghanaians that after the introduction of e-gates at Kotoka, the facilities will be extended to other airports across the country such as those of Tamale and Kumasi, as well as to all other points of entry into the country.Early this month, Ghana also launched its new chip-embedded passport with enhanced security features to combat identity theft and improve travel experience.",

Reviewed by Cameron Woodhead JAZZ Strange Attractors + Andrea Keller\u2019s Transients \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Melbourne Women\u2019s International Jazz Festival, The JazzLab, December 9 One of the hallmarks of the Melbourne Women\u2019s International Jazz Festival \u2013 curated each year by the tireless Sonja Horbelt \u2013 is its presentation of double-bill concerts on most nights. Horbelt, who assembles the program each year with minimal funding and maximum dedication, aims to provide opportunities for as many artists as possible, and the double bills are often designed to present acts with contrasting rather than complementary approaches. Jess Green and Dylan Van Der Schyff perform at The JazzLab on December 9, 2024 Credit: Roger Mitchell A case in point: Monday night\u2019s pairing of Strange Attractors with Andrea Keller\u2019s Transients . The former featured two artists constructing fully improvised soundscapes; the latter featured a beguiling set of carefully crafted compositions. Strange Attractors (guitarist Jess Green and drummer Dylan van der Schyff) is inspired by nature\u2019s propensity to forge patterns out of chaos. Green and van der Schyff are only occasional duo partners, but their rapport was palpable as they embarked on a spontaneous exploration of texture, tone, energy and rhythm. Traditional instrumental roles were eschewed in favour of a free-flowing exchange of sounds and ideas, with Green scratching or tapping percussively on her strings and van der Schyff switching between sticks, mallets, bare hands and cymbals to conjure images of swarming insects or clouds scudding swiftly across a turbulent sky. Andrea Keller\u2019s set served as an album launch for the latest recordings in her long-running Transients project, where the pianist works with an evolving roster of musicians in small-group settings. On this occasion, she shared the stage with three wonderfully empathetic colleagues (Angela Davis on alto sax, Sam Anning on bass and Kyrie Anderson on drums), performing selections from Transients Vol. 3 (For Sorrow) and Vol. 4 (For Joy ). Andrea Keller\u2019s set served as an album launch for the latest recordings in her long-running Transients project. Credit: Jamil Nawaz Keller\u2019s exquisite melodies and inventive arrangements were enhanced by the band\u2019s ability to intuitively shape the mood of each piece, from the insouciance of Carefree Daze to the quiet optimism of Hope is the Thing With Feathers \u2013 something to hold on to, perhaps, as another tumultuous year nears its end.

                    "content": "The \u2018Bahia Emerald\u2019: The story of a giant cursed gem stolen from Brazil A US judge has authorized the repatriation of the 837 lb gem, valued at hundreds of millions of dollars One of the largest emeralds to be excavated from a mine in Brazil\u2019s Bahia region at the start of this century, the \u2018Bahia Emerald,\u2019 has been under L.A. police protection for the past 10 years. In the photos you can see the crystals, embedded in a blackish stone. They are bright green and you can guess at their hexagonal shape. The Bahia Emerald is a rare and valuable piece that can be summed up in figures: 380 kilos (837 pounds), 180,000 carats. And it is so exotic that estimates of its worth range from between $370 million and $920 million. The giant gem was taken out of Brazil under false pretenses and eventually confiscated in Las Vegas . It remains in safekeeping while the U.S. justice system resolves the long litigation involving the Brazilian State, individuals and U.S. companies, all of whom claim ownership. At the end of November, a federal judge ruled in favor of Brazil and authorized the gem to be repatriated, but there is room for appeal. Since its discovery in 2001, the life of the Bahia Emerald has been nothing if not eventful. Excavated from a mine in the Carnai\u0301ba mountain range, 400 kilometers (248 miles) inland from Salvador, where five other giant emeralds have been discovered this century, it has earned a reputation for being cursed. It passed through numerous hands, sometimes in shady transactions, until two Brazilians took it out of the country in 2005. They got it out by claiming it was asphalt stone and natural bitumen. Declared value? $100. Next stop, the United States. That same year the emerald survived Hurricane Katrina, which flooded the warehouse where it was stored. That year it was sold to the highest bidder on eBay for $19 million, according to Wired magazine. But the transaction never went through. Over the years, the plot thickened: sales at different prices, a fake kidnapping, the use of the emerald as collateral in a diamond sale... In 2008, thanks to a tip-off, the police confiscated the Bahia Emerald in an operation in Las Vegas, complete with special forces and a helicopter. Since then, it has been at the center of a judicial battle. Innumerable Bahia emeralds have passed through the hands of the gemologist Monica Correa, but not the Bahia Emerald. She has only seen it in photos. The black mineral in which the precious crystals are embedded is called biotite, she explains. She works with polished pieces for jewelry rather than with the rough stones that attract collectors because of their exuberance and size. \u201cIf you look at this one, you can even see the hexagon shape that emerald crystals have in their natural state,\u201d says Correa, who works at the Gemological Center of Bahia, in Salvador, where she analyzes the purity of gemstones for certification. If the Bahia Emerald is returned to Brazil , it would mark a milestone in the country\u2019s battle to recover pieces plundered centuries ago. Last May, Denmark returned an invaluable piece of indigenous art, also from Bahia, to the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro: a very delicate red feather cape sewn by the Tupinamba\u0301 Indians that had been in the Danish royal collection since 1689. In 2023, Germany\u2019s National Museum of Natural History in Karlsruhe returned the Ubirajara jubatus, the fossil of a dinosaur that lived 110 million years ago in Ceara\u0301, which has become the most famous in Brazil thanks to a successful campaign on social media to demand its return from Germany. The case of the Bahia Emerald is as convoluted as a Brazilian soap opera with any number of protagonists, entanglements, betrayals and a plot that is hard to follow. For years, a number of individuals and companies claiming ownership have been fighting it out in the U.S. courts, represented by a large army of law firms. The courts have recognized that some of them acted in good faith and were deceived, but none of them have been recognized as having the right to ownership. On November 21, U.S. federal judge Reggie Walton ruled in favor of the Brazilian state, which has also been immersed in a legal battle to recover what it considers a national treasure. Lawyers for the Brazilian Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office adopted a novel strategy, according to Reuters: they called on their U.S. colleagues to comply with the bilateral agreement committing them to enforce Brazilian rulings. The Brazilian magistrate who convicted those who removed the stone from Brazil in 2017 also demanded that it be repatriated. Now Judge Walton has ruled that this be complied with. The Carnai\u0301ba mountain range is considered the Brazilian capital of emeralds. It was 1963 when a farmer who was clearing stubble from his field came across some shiny green stones. He handed them over to the authorities. In no time, the news that there were emeralds in the interior of Bahia spread far and wide. An army of garimpeiros (artisanal miners) promptly appeared to mine the earth, according to Jornal Correio . It was full steam ahead until the end of the 1970s, when the miners came up against an impassable quartz plate. It was in the 1980s when news of a new emerald deposit in Goia\u0301s, 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) to the west, reached Pindobac\u0327u and other cities in the highlands, and off the miners went. Some perhaps even became rich, but the most valuable thing for the Bahian garimpeiros was to learn about technological advances from their colleagues in Goia\u0301s. They learned to dig beyond the quartz plate. And, of course, they went back home immediately with this knowledge to extract the precious stones from the interior of Bahia. Organized into a cooperative since 2006, some 600 miners work in the municipality\u2019s 81 deposits. Last year, they extracted 400 tons of the stone in which the precious green gems are embedded. But the biggest prize is the Bahia Emerald \u2018sisters.\u2019 Six have been discovered in 25 years. The last one, just recently, in September. It is not unreasonable to think that if Brazil manages to recover the Bahia Emerald, one option would be to hand it over to the Geological Museum of Bahia, in Salvador. But the museologist Elizandra Pinheiro says that no one has contacted them to discuss this possibility. Beyond its multi-million-dollar price tag, the emerald has an enormous patrimonial value. \u201cIt represents a historical context: the garimpeira community, an economic activity that passes from generation to generation,\u201d explains Pinheiro, who points out that Bahia has already had its diamond, gold and emerald rushes. The museum, which exhibits the rich geological heritage of the state in the form of meteorites and fossils, is also a research center. In 2025, it will be half a century old. Who knows if, in a new unexpected twist in this long saga, it will become home to the cursed Bahia Emerald.

                    "description": "\"Know thyself is a deep concept and drives my own personal journey in my quest to reconnect with my soul and others on this journey of being human,\" writes columnist Claire Nielsen.",
                    "content": "The question \u2018Who am I?\u2019 has intrigued mankind since the birth of our consciousness. I remember the first time I asked myself \u2018Who am I?\u2019 I think I was about nine or 10 years old. This query embarked me on a journey of self-discovery and investigation into religion and spirituality, my connection to nature, my place in the universe, and what was going on in my own mind and body. I am obviously still on this journey with many unanswered questions and distractions, but I have some theories that have brought me some peace over the years. I think we seek this question of self-discovery as an intrinsic longing and drive for (re)connection and belonging. We do many things to fulfil our individual needs for self-identity. When we choose to find our identity through the eyes of others, we may compete using money and acquisitions, success, education and knowledge, beauty, power and control, popularity, physical ability, and sports...etc. In this way, we answer the question of \u2018Who am I?\u2019 with the answer \u2018I prove myself to others by...\u2019 or \u2018I need to be better than others through...\u2019 Even though competition is a normal part of human culture, I don\u2019t feel it should be the focus that drives us in our personal self-discovery work, as it can be a great distraction. Also, the competitive drive for validation will only fulfil our longing for identity for so long, as we eventually lose our edge and fall off our own pedestal. Who are we then? The humbling of mankind happens when we stop viewing our own identity through what others may think (or what we think they think). When we are humbled by our inability to compete anymore, we can become angry and bitter or we can let it go and look for another identity. We see this in older age: people either soften to each other (mellowing with age) or get angry, frustrated or resentful at their own inability to compete anymore. Know thyself is a deep concept and drives my own personal journey in my quest to reconnect with my soul and others on this journey of being human. My interpretation of know thyself is to understand the concept of the trilogy body, mind and spirit. I want to know my body and understand what it is telling me \u2014 how to optimally survive in my human physical existence. Am I listening to my body and honouring what it tells me? (Inflammation is how our body says \u2018No\u2019 and can take many forms). I have written many articles on physical health, inflammation, and the nutritional component to being healthy. What do I need to do (or stop doing) in order to be healthy in this temporary human vehicle? Can I be courageous enough to know my mind and understand the duality of my thinking, while making friends with my egoic mind (rather than resisting it) in the process? In this way, I can make sense of my attachments, my addictions, my judgments, my resistance, my suffering... but also embrace the power of my beautiful mind to create and manifest, connect to gratitude, be present, and to choose the energy of love to guide me in this journey. This intention to understand the complexities of our minds often involves some healing. Which leads me to spirit. As we navigate this dualistic experience in our human bodies and minds, connecting to spirit can move us out of the unhealthy chaos in our minds and into the centre of our being. I feel the centre of my being (my soul within) at the top of my breath and I use my breath when I have the intention to connect spiritually. I often connect with gratitude in my focused breathing, while sending love on my exhaled breath to wherever it may be needed in the form of a prayer for the suffering of humanity. Sometimes my prayer is directed towards an individual or group or situation, or the earth, and sometimes I just send this loving intention for healing to the ether and trust it will land where it is needed. If needed, I send a prayer of love and healing to the trauma from my childhood. This seems to soften my attachment to that which caused my suffering. Finding a meditative practice using one\u2019s breath can be very healing to the mind and body, and help facilitate a beautiful spiritual connection. The Latin word for spirit is spi\u0304ritus, which literally means breath. Most religions use breathwork to access a spiritual connection to their definition of source or creation. During our time as being human, our breath is our life force, and we live our lives one present breath at a time. There are many definitions of creator depending on what spiritual practice one aligns with, but the word religion literally means reconnection, and I feel that having a discerning and loving practice of reconnection is the reason for our individual spiritual beliefs and practices. (\u201cThere are many paths to enlightenment \u2014 be sure to take the one with a loving heart.\" Lau Tzu) As we come to know ourselves in body, mind and spirit, we have the opportunity to settle into an acceptance of who we really are and let go of resistance and misconceptions that cause anxiety (fear) and the lack of presence. To know thyself is an idea that has been contemplated since man has had a thinking mind. It drives each of our individual journeys and the paths of our lives.

                    "description": "\"Know thyself is a deep concept and drives my own personal journey in my quest to reconnect with my soul and others on this journey of being human,\" writes columnist Claire Nielsen.",
                    "content": "The question \u2018Who am I?\u2019 has intrigued mankind since the birth of our consciousness. I remember the first time I asked myself \u2018Who am I?\u2019 I think I was about nine or 10 years old. This query embarked me on a journey of self-discovery and investigation into religion and spirituality, my connection to nature, my place in the universe, and what was going on in my own mind and body. I am obviously still on this journey with many unanswered questions and distractions, but I have some theories that have brought me some peace over the years. I think we seek this question of self-discovery as an intrinsic longing and drive for (re)connection and belonging. We do many things to fulfil our individual needs for self-identity. When we choose to find our identity through the eyes of others, we may compete using money and acquisitions, success, education and knowledge, beauty, power and control, popularity, physical ability, and sports...etc. In this way, we answer the question of \u2018Who am I?\u2019 with the answer \u2018I prove myself to others by...\u2019 or \u2018I need to be better than others through...\u2019 Even though competition is a normal part of human culture, I don\u2019t feel it should be the focus that drives us in our personal self-discovery work, as it can be a great distraction. Also, the competitive drive for validation will only fulfil our longing for identity for so long, as we eventually lose our edge and fall off our own pedestal. Who are we then? The humbling of mankind happens when we stop viewing our own identity through what others may think (or what we think they think). When we are humbled by our inability to compete anymore, we can become angry and bitter or we can let it go and look for another identity. We see this in older age: people either soften to each other (mellowing with age) or get angry, frustrated or resentful at their own inability to compete anymore. Know thyself is a deep concept and drives my own personal journey in my quest to reconnect with my soul and others on this journey of being human. My interpretation of know thyself is to understand the concept of the trilogy body, mind and spirit. I want to know my body and understand what it is telling me \u2014 how to optimally survive in my human physical existence. Am I listening to my body and honouring what it tells me? (Inflammation is how our body says \u2018No\u2019 and can take many forms). I have written many articles on physical health, inflammation, and the nutritional component to being healthy. What do I need to do (or stop doing) in order to be healthy in this temporary human vehicle? Can I be courageous enough to know my mind and understand the duality of my thinking, while making friends with my egoic mind (rather than resisting it) in the process? In this way, I can make sense of my attachments, my addictions, my judgments, my resistance, my suffering... but also embrace the power of my beautiful mind to create and manifest, connect to gratitude, be present, and to choose the energy of love to guide me in this journey. This intention to understand the complexities of our minds often involves some healing. Which leads me to spirit. As we navigate this dualistic experience in our human bodies and minds, connecting to spirit can move us out of the unhealthy chaos in our minds and into the centre of our being. I feel the centre of my being (my soul within) at the top of my breath and I use my breath when I have the intention to connect spiritually. I often connect with gratitude in my focused breathing, while sending love on my exhaled breath to wherever it may be needed in the form of a prayer for the suffering of humanity. Sometimes my prayer is directed towards an individual or group or situation, or the earth, and sometimes I just send this loving intention for healing to the ether and trust it will land where it is needed. If needed, I send a prayer of love and healing to the trauma from my childhood. This seems to soften my attachment to that which caused my suffering. Finding a meditative practice using one\u2019s breath can be very healing to the mind and body, and help facilitate a beautiful spiritual connection. The Latin word for spirit is spi\u0304ritus, which literally means breath. Most religions use breathwork to access a spiritual connection to their definition of source or creation. During our time as being human, our breath is our life force, and we live our lives one present breath at a time. There are many definitions of creator depending on what spiritual practice one aligns with, but the word religion literally means reconnection, and I feel that having a discerning and loving practice of reconnection is the reason for our individual spiritual beliefs and practices. (\u201cThere are many paths to enlightenment \u2014 be sure to take the one with a loving heart.\" Lau Tzu) As we come to know ourselves in body, mind and spirit, we have the opportunity to settle into an acceptance of who we really are and let go of resistance and misconceptions that cause anxiety (fear) and the lack of presence. To know thyself is an idea that has been contemplated since man has had a thinking mind. It drives each of our individual journeys and the paths of our lives.

                    "description": "The Jewish festival of Hanukkah, which in 2022 begins on the evening of Dec. 18, focuses on the story of the male Maccabees. But women are also heroes in histories from that era, including Judith and Hannah.",
                    "content": "The eight-day Jewish festival of Hanukkah commemorates ancient Jews\u2019 victory over the powerful Seleucid empire, which ruled much of the Middle East from the third century B.C. to the first century A.D. On the surface, it\u2019s a story of male heroism. A ragtag rebel force led by a rural priest and his five sons, called the Maccabees, freed the Jews from oppressive rulers. Hanukkah, which means \u201crededication\u201d in Hebrew, celebrates the Maccabees\u2019 victory, which allowed the Jews to rededicate their temple in Jerusalem, the center of ancient Jewish worship. But as a professor of Jewish history , I believe that seeing Hanukkah this way misses the inspiring women who were prominent in the earliest tellings of the story. The bravery of a young widow named Judith is at the heart of an ancient book that bears her name. The heroism of a second woman, an unnamed mother of seven sons, appears in a book known as 2 Maccabees. These books are not included in the Hebrew scriptures, but appear in other collections of religious texts known as the Septuagint and the Apocrypha . According to these texts, Judith was a young Israelite widow in a town called Bethulia, strategically situated on a mountain pass into Jerusalem. To besiege Jerusalem, the Seleucid army first needed to capture Bethulia. Facing such a formidable enemy, the townsfolk were terrified. Unless God immediately intervened, they decided, they would simply surrender . Enslavement was preferable to certain death. But Judith scolded the local leaders for testing God, and was brave enough to take matters into her own hands. Removing her widow\u2019s clothing, she entered the enemy camp. She beguiled the Seleucid general, Holofernes, with her beauty, and promised to give her people over to him. Hoping to seduce her, Holofernes prepared a feast . By the time his entourage left him alone with Judith, he was drunk and asleep. Now she carried out her plan: cutting off his head and escaping back to Bethulia. The following morning, the discovery of Holofernes\u2019 headless body left the Seleucid army trembling with fear. Soldiers fled by every available path as Bethulia\u2019s Jews, recovering their courage, rushed in and slaughtered them. Judith\u2019s bravery saved her town and, with it, Jerusalem. The book of 2 Maccabees, Chapter 7, meanwhile, relates the story of an unnamed Jewish mother and her seven sons, who were seized by the Seleucids. Emperor Antiochus commanded that they eat pork, which is forbidden by the Torah, to show their obedience to him. One at a time, the sons refused. An enraged Antiochus subjected them to unspeakable torture. Each son withstood the ordeal and is portrayed as a model of bravery. Resurrection awaits those who die in the service of God, they proclaimed, while for Antiochus and his followers, only death and divine punishment lay ahead. Throughout these ordeals, their mother encouraged her sons to accept their suffering. \u201cShe reinforced her woman\u2019s reasoning with a man\u2019s courage,\u201d as 2 Maccabees relates, and admonished her sons to remember their coming reward from God. Having killed the first six brothers, Antiochus promised the youngest a fortune if only he would reject his faith. His mother told the boy, \u201cAccept death, so that in God\u2019s mercy I may get you back again along with your brothers.\u201d The story in 2 Maccabees ends with the simple statement that, after her sons\u2019 deaths, the mother also died. Later retellings give the mother a name. Most commonly, she is called Hannah , based on a detail in the biblical book of 1 Samuel . In this section, called the \u201cprayer of Hannah,\u201d the prophet Samuel\u2019s mother refers to herself as having borne seven children. Jewish educator and author Erica Brown has emphasized a lesson we should learn from the story of Judith, one that emerges from 2 Maccabees as well. \u201cJust like the Hanukkah story generally, the message of these texts is that it\u2019s not always the likely candidates who save the day,\u201d she writes . \u201cSometimes salvation comes when you least expect it, from those who are least likely to deliver it.\u201d Three hundred years after the Maccabean revolt, Judaism\u2019s earliest rabbis stressed a similar message. Adding a new focus to Hanukkah, they spoke of a divine miracle that occurred when the ancient Jews took back the Temple and wanted to relight the holy \u201c eternal flame \u201d inside. They found just one small vessel of oil, sufficient to light the flame for only one day \u2013 but it lasted eight days, giving them time to produce a new supply. As the influential rabbi David Hartman pointed out , the Hanukkah story celebrates \u201cour people\u2019s strength to live without guarantees of success.\u201d Some ordinary person, he points out, took the initiative to rekindle the eternal flame, despite how futile doing so may have seemed. Ever since, Judaism has increasingly focused on the interaction of the human and the divine. The Hanukkah story teaches listeners that they all must play a part to repair a hurting world. Not everyone needs to be a Judith or Hannah; but, like them, we humans can\u2019t wait for God to take care of it. In synagogues, one of the readings for the week during Hanukkah is from the prophet Zechariah , who proclaimed, \u201cNot by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, says the Lord of hosts.\u201d These words succinctly capture the meaning of Hanukkah and express what Jews might think about while lighting the Hanukkah candles: our responsibility to act in the spirit of God to create the miracles the world needs to become a place of beauty, equity and freedom.

                    "description": "Eight-hundred horseback riders made the Archdiocese of Chicago pilgrimage to a Marian shrine in Des Plaines to celebrate the feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe.",
                    "content": "Deacon Bob Hermes offers The Pantagraph a tour of Holy Trinity Catholic Church and a look at its history. Fidelia Meza has a devotion to the Virgin Mary. When the 31-year-old Catholic from Kankakee County got married, she brought roses to Mary. When celebrating the feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Meza typically brings her more flowers \u2014 that is, she might lay flowers near a statue of Mary in a church and pray. On Saturday morning, Meza made a physically larger gesture to the mother of Jesus. She rode a horse in an annual Archdiocese of Chicago pilgrimage to a Marian shrine in Des Plaines. The reason for the added gesture was that Meza wanted to say a special prayer for her niece\u2019s son, who was born recently with medical problems. \u201cHopefully she can help the baby and my entire family because my family and I, we are very close together,\u201d Meza said before the ride. \u201cSo anything that happens in our family, it jeopardizes everybody. So I\u2019m hoping the Virgin Mary can do a miracle and get the baby out of these seizures and be healthy.\u201d By 7:30 a.m., about a dozen horse trailers had pulled into Dam No. 1 Woods, a Cook County forest preserve along the Des Plaines River and about five miles north of the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Around 10 a.m. near a pavilion in the forest preserve, hundreds of riders and their horses crowded around an altar and Deacon Miguel Vargas to listen to a few scripture readings and some preaching in Spanish. The horseback pilgrimage \u2014 which had 800 riders, according to the archdiocese \u2014 was the \u201cunofficial start\u201d of activities at the Des Plaines shrine for the feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe, which Catholics celebrate Dec. 12. Our Lady of Guadalupe is one of Mary\u2019s many titles. It\u2019s connected with a set of Marian appearances to Mexican peasant Juan Diego that are believed to have occurred nearly 500 years ago, in December 1531. Jose Trujillo\u2019s horse with Our Lady of Guadalupe on its fur before the Archdiocese of Chicago\u2019s 13th Annual Horseback Pilgrimage in Honor of Our Lady of Guadalupe to the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe at Dam No. 1 Woods Forest Preserve in Wheeling on Dec. 7, 2024. Vargas, 60, of Hoffman Estates, said Catholics make pilgrimages for Our Lady of Guadalupe to show her they are grateful for the blessings in their lives, such as their jobs and families. One reason to make a pilgrimage on horseback specifically is that horses are a reminder of the days when people needed them to harvest the land and to live, said Vargas, who is originally from Monterrey, Mexico. Consequently, horses are also a reminder of one\u2019s principles, values and culture, he said. \u201cWhen they go on the pilgrimage, they\u2019re going to be riding for maybe two or three hours,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be reflecting.\u201d Juan Pozo, 25, did not ride. Instead, the Carpentersville resident helped distribute hot drinks, Mexican pastries called conchas and tamales made by his mom to those gathered near the pavilion, the pilgrimage\u2019s starting point. Pozo said he\u2019s been involved with the horseback pilgrimage, which is in its 13th year, since the beginning. If someone doesn\u2019t have a specific petition to bring before Mary, feast celebrations are opportune times to be thankful for what has happened during the past year and to finish the year on a good note, he said. After following the river south, when riders reach the journey\u2019s end \u2014 the shrine on North River Road \u2014 they are given flowers to hand over to Mary, Pozo said. He added that whenever he visits the shrine, he feels a special internal calmness. \u201cI would have to say you don\u2019t necessarily have to be part of a religion to feel being welcome there,\u201d Pozo said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really nice place.\u201d According to the archdiocese, hundreds of thousands of faithful are expected to attend feast day events at the shrine on Dec. 11 and 12.

                    "content": "Deacon Bob Hermes offers The Pantagraph a tour of Holy Trinity Catholic Church and a look at its history. Fidelia Meza has a devotion to the Virgin Mary. When the 31-year-old Catholic from Kankakee County got married, she brought roses to Mary. When celebrating the feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Meza typically brings her more flowers \u2014 that is, she might lay flowers near a statue of Mary in a church and pray. On Saturday morning, Meza made a physically larger gesture to the mother of Jesus. She rode a horse in an annual Archdiocese of Chicago pilgrimage to a Marian shrine in Des Plaines. The reason for the added gesture was that Meza wanted to say a special prayer for her niece\u2019s son, who was born recently with medical problems. \u201cHopefully she can help the baby and my entire family because my family and I, we are very close together,\u201d Meza said before the ride. \u201cSo anything that happens in our family, it jeopardizes everybody. So I\u2019m hoping the Virgin Mary can do a miracle and get the baby out of these seizures and be healthy.\u201d People are also reading... By 7:30 a.m., about a dozen horse trailers had pulled into Dam No. 1 Woods, a Cook County forest preserve along the Des Plaines River and about five miles north of the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Around 10 a.m. near a pavilion in the forest preserve, hundreds of riders and their horses crowded around an altar and Deacon Miguel Vargas to listen to a few scripture readings and some preaching in Spanish. The horseback pilgrimage \u2014 which had 800 riders, according to the archdiocese \u2014 was the \u201cunofficial start\u201d of activities at the Des Plaines shrine for the feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe, which Catholics celebrate Dec. 12. Our Lady of Guadalupe is one of Mary\u2019s many titles. It\u2019s connected with a set of Marian appearances to Mexican peasant Juan Diego that are believed to have occurred nearly 500 years ago, in December 1531. Jose Trujillo\u2019s horse with Our Lady of Guadalupe on its fur before the Archdiocese of Chicago\u2019s 13th Annual Horseback Pilgrimage in Honor of Our Lady of Guadalupe to the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe at Dam No. 1 Woods Forest Preserve in Wheeling on Dec. 7, 2024. Vargas, 60, of Hoffman Estates, said Catholics make pilgrimages for Our Lady of Guadalupe to show her they are grateful for the blessings in their lives, such as their jobs and families. One reason to make a pilgrimage on horseback specifically is that horses are a reminder of the days when people needed them to harvest the land and to live, said Vargas, who is originally from Monterrey, Mexico. Consequently, horses are also a reminder of one\u2019s principles, values and culture, he said. \u201cWhen they go on the pilgrimage, they\u2019re going to be riding for maybe two or three hours,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be reflecting.\u201d Juan Pozo, 25, did not ride. Instead, the Carpentersville resident helped distribute hot drinks, Mexican pastries called conchas and tamales made by his mom to those gathered near the pavilion, the pilgrimage\u2019s starting point. Pozo said he\u2019s been involved with the horseback pilgrimage, which is in its 13th year, since the beginning. If someone doesn\u2019t have a specific petition to bring before Mary, feast celebrations are opportune times to be thankful for what has happened during the past year and to finish the year on a good note, he said. After following the river south, when riders reach the journey\u2019s end \u2014 the shrine on North River Road \u2014 they are given flowers to hand over to Mary, Pozo said. He added that whenever he visits the shrine, he feels a special internal calmness. \u201cI would have to say you don\u2019t necessarily have to be part of a religion to feel being welcome there,\u201d Pozo said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really nice place.\u201d According to the archdiocese, hundreds of thousands of faithful are expected to attend feast day events at the shrine on Dec. 11 and 12.

                    "description": "Studies show that spiritual practices like meditation and prayer can lower anxiety and depression and create a sense of hope despite external hardships.",
                    "content": "Spirituality is a multi-faceted term encompassing various concepts tied to identity, purpose, and connection. While religions function with a set of organized beliefs, spirituality is a highly flexible way to obtain inner peace and connection to a higher power. No matter what spirituality looks like to an individual, it involves universal themes of love, belonging, compassion, and shared experiences of reality. Spirituality can be a catalyst for personal growth and fulfillment, and significantly enhance physical and mental well-being. Studies show that spiritual practices like meditation and prayer can lower anxiety and depression and create a sense of hope despite external hardships. This provides an unwavering sense of purpose and support in navigating challenging periods of life. Maintaining a strong spiritual practice also comes with additional benefits including promoting social cohesion and ethics. Ultimately, spirituality is a driving force behind self-actualization, a person's ability to be a contributing member of society and sometimes provides a direct experience of unity. It should be no surprise then, that spirituality has been on the rise in recent years, especially after the pandemic rocked everyone's faith in humanity. In 2023, 70% of American adults considered themselves spiritual, either because they identify as such or find importance in spiritual habits. This portion of the nation's population is growing steadily as younger generations move away from institutionalized religion for a more individualized faith path aligned with their unique views on life. David Kosak , a prominent faith leader and Senior Rabbi at Congregation Neveh Shalom, sees positivity in this trend. An increase in spirituality isn't a threat to organized religions. It can actually increase faith diversity and encourage communities to be tolerant of differences. However, David advocates for spiritual or religious individuals to learn about the three types of spirituality and their impact on communities. Religion or spiritual groups can exhibit a variety of these traits at once, but David believes unity spirituality is the most beneficial for humanity. He draws on analogies about human tribalism and the environment to explain why. Violence, bigotry, and a sense of superiority are the defining characteristics of splinter spirituality, which exacerbates human's inherent sense of tribalism. Because many individuals have only encountered splinter spirituality, they have a negative perception of religion and the way it can divide society. The second manifestation is identity spirituality. This belief system places a strong emphasis on rituals, talismans, and other behaviors that can be considered religious behaviorism that impart a sense of connection without personal transformation. Unity spirituality, the expression of belief that David advocates for, differs from the previous types because of its transformational nature. When compared to identity-based or splinter spirituality, this unifying approach transcends the inherited structure of belief, enabling people to discover themselves as they deepen their faith. This is a major reason why David cites unity spirituality as the gold standard for how people should strive to express their beliefs. \"Unity spirituality is a term I coined to describe a kind of perennial wisdom that allows the devout to find belonging and experience inner growth while also recognizing the commonalities they share with others,\" David says. \"The basis of this positive expression of spirituality lies in its focus on compassion, tolerance, and humanity while honoring all creation. Rather than getting bogged down by the things that separate us, people embracing this school of thought are open enough to sense that we as humans are all connected regardless of any distinction we can see with our eyes.\" In an age where polarization is at an all-time high, David's take on community and collective responsibility is a bit jarring. Although the thought leader never places blame on individuals for falling into their primal urge to identify strongly with social groups, humans have an innate tendency to demonstrate favoritism for 'in-groups' and hostility toward 'out-groups'. This tribalism is an evolutionary default mechanism for humans, who have used this practice to evade predators and survive harsh conditions. Instead of focusing on what people can't control, David brings attention to strategies and perspectives that can temper this drive and therefore unite communities. \"Nonviolent communication and frequent conversations at the intersection of different faith groups are powerful antidotes against prejudice and discrimination,\" David explains. \"Humans empathize more with people they are familiar with and often seek out information and groups that validate their existing beliefs. When most of us live in a bubble of curated experiences and social groups aligned to our perspective, it's difficult to break out of this shell and see how our preconceived notions are actually misguided.\" The first step to nurturing this sense of unity and connection requires a conscious decision fueled by courage and faith. However, this investment pays generous dividends to those stepping outside their comfort zone. Enhanced creativity, problem-solving, and better interpersonal relationships are just a few benefits for individuals who welcome diversity\u2013whether it be tied to spirituality or not. From a big-picture context, the collective can also experience advantages from unity spirituality and the tolerance that comes with it. David uses the environmental crisis as a timely example of what's possible when people work together. \"Humanity repaired gaping holes in the ozone layer by making technical changes that protected our atmosphere. Whether we're looking to shore up the holes in our planet or our souls, society can find medicine in our fellow man just as easily as other resources,\" he says. Some might even argue that climate change is a symptom of society's spiritual defects that manifest as a scientifically driven phenomenon. When examined from this angle, faith quickly becomes a common denominator for healing, unity, and progress. When society limits itself to identity or splinter spirituality people experience the world as deeply subjective and remain divided. Unity spirituality, however, provides a more objective and universal experience of humanity's bonds with one another. As more people awaken to this, David envisions a society where people find solace in one another and work together to conquer challenges and achieve harmony.",

                    "description": "The betrayal of Hindus in Bangladesh is an outcome of shared complicity among its major political parties",
                    "content": "During the 1971 war that led to the creation of Bangladesh, Khondaker Mostaq Ahmed, then a senior leader of the Awami League, visited the camps of the Mukti Bahini. This outfit, trained by India, was at the forefront of the home-grown resistance against the West Pakistan forces. The Mukti Bahini rebels were drawn from all faiths and the walls of their bunkers were adorned with symbols of Islam, Hinduism and even Buddhism. Afterall, this was a war of liberation for the rights of all Bengalis in what was the then East Pakistan, not merely people of one religion. But Khondaker did not see it that way. He told the rebels: \u2018Since most of you are Muslims, for Allah\u2019s sake do not practice secularism. Shudhu Allah Allah karo (Take only Allah\u2019s name).\u2019 This incident, chronicled in detail in journalist Manash Ghosh\u2019s book \u2018Bangladesh War: Report from Ground Zero\u2019 (Niyogi Books), captured how the seeds of Islamization were sown in the Bangladesh liberation movement before the country was born. This was a battle of ideas about what Bangladesh ought to be. Once linguistic nationalism had its way in establishing a new country, was religion going to define its identity? It didn\u2019t take long. As Bangladesh, after its hard-won freedom, began tumbling towards near-anarchy under its founder Mujib-ur-Rehman, its experiment with secularism was unable to withstand the impulse of majoritarian assertion. Mujib and his family were assassinated in 1975 \u2013 only his daughters Sheikh Hasina and Rehana survived \u2013 and those who succeeded him in a prolonged period of political instability steered Bangladesh further away from its self-proclaimed secular foundations. Khondaker, who took over as President in 1975 and granted immunity to Mujib\u2019s killers, was keen to forge closer ties with Pakistan and ended his inaugural speech using the Urdu-ized slogan \u2018Bangladesh Zindabad\u2019 as opposed to the popular \u2018Joy Bangla.\u2019 In 1977, under then President Ziaur Rahman \u2013 the late husband of Bangladesh National Party leader Khaleda Zia \u2013 the prayer \u2018Bismillah-ir-Rahman-ir-Rahim (in the name of Allah, the most gracious and most merciful) was inserted in the constitution\u2019s Preamble. Secularism was done away with. In 1988, Hussain Muhammad Ershad, who had assumed power after another military coup, sought to win over the Jamaat-E-Islami and effected a change to the constitution by establishing Islam as Bangladesh\u2019s state religion. But there would be a revival, with the courts ruling almost two decades later that removing secularism from the constitution violated one of the fundamental principles that the struggle for Bangladesh was based on. And during Sheikh Hasina\u2019s tenure as Prime Minister, in 2011, secularism would be reintroduced as a \u2018fundamental principle of State policy\u2019 in the constitution, though Islam remained the state religion. However, even this restoration could be headed for a burial. Bangladesh\u2019s attorney general has argued that a constitutional commitment to secularism does not reflect the realities of a country that is 90% Muslim. It won\u2019t be a surprise then if it is consigned to memory eventually. Those who look back wistfully at Bangladesh\u2019s reverence for Rabindranath Tagore, its adoption of Amar Sonar Bangla as its national anthem and its celebration of Durga Puja will have to concede that this \u2018syncretism\u2019, if not wholly abandoned, has been rendered subordinate to the state\u2019s embrace of Islam. And it has ceased to be a shield against organized persecution of minorities, especially Hindus. Apart from repetitive bouts of violence against Hindus, perhaps the most glaring evidence of state oppression is the Vested Property Act, a successor to Pakistan\u2019s Enemy Property Act, which has been used as an instrument of land grab against Hindus. In his book \u2018The Colonel Who Would Not Repent: The Bangladesh War and Its Unquiet Legacy\u2019 (Aleph Books), journalist Salil Tripathi has cited claims that through the 1990s, this Act was used to confiscate two million acres of land, property and other resources. According to these findings, 40% of Bangladeshi Hindu families were affected by the law, 1.64 million acres of land were lost, which constituted 50% of land that Hindus owned and 5% of the total land area in the country. And all parties, the \u2018secular\u2019 Awami League included, participated in this loot. As Tripathi writes, \u201c44 percent of the beneficiaries were from the Awami League, 31.7% from the BNP, 5.8% from the Jatiyo party, and 4.8% from the Jamaat.\u201d The Bangladesh attorney general\u2019s decision to sound the death knell to constitutional secularism is just another chapter in a long history of betrayal that Hindus have faced in that country. It is a history that even \u2018secular\u2019 governments of the past have been complicit in shaping. Their ongoing plight has made a compelling case for the Citizenship Amendment Act in India, which acknowledges this prolonged persecution and provides Indian citizenship to refugees from six religious minorities, including Hindus, from three neighbouring Islamic countries if they arrived here before 2014. The question then arises: Why shouldn't the CAA deadline be amended to accommodate Hindus fleeing Bangladesh now? India\u2019s foreign secretary Vikram Misri\u2019s visit to Bangladesh is now of enormous significance. Bangladesh has been keen to dismiss recent reports of attacks on Hindus as \u2018baseless propaganda\u2019. The interactions will be a test of India\u2019s influence and leverage with a neighbour that, under its new dispensation, cares little about collaboration in the shared history of its creation.

                    "content": "FRANKLIN TOWNSHIP, N.J.: Just off a state highway in New Jersey, one of the largest statues of the Buddha in the United States appears unexpectedly in the middle of a backyard. It rises 30 feet high from the woods in Franklin Township, near Princeton, where it was built a decade ago under the leadership of a Sri Lankan monk ordained in Theravada, one of the oldest forms of Buddhism. His dream? Uniting people of all faiths. Today, the statue in the New Jersey Buddhist Vihara and Meditation Center has become a hub for interfaith efforts and a spiritual home for practicing Buddhists, Hindus and Christians, reflecting New Jersey\u2019s diverse religious landscape. Among them: a Princeton University professor who grew up in a Korean Christian church and who follows Tibetan Buddhism; a leader of the local Nepali community who organizes interfaith gatherings and tends to a peace garden at the premises; and a woman who \u2014 after living near the statue for years \u2014 became a practicing Buddhist. \u201cIt just seems to be a nexus where a lot of people connect,\u201d said Daniel Choi, who teaches writing at Princeton and has been meditating in front of the Buddha statue since 2015. \u201cIt definitely feels like a public shrine,\u201d he said, adding that it\u2019s hard to find such places. Most Buddhist centers in the US are run by private organizations, \u201cwhere you wouldn\u2019t be able to go in for open practice,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s what\u2019s unique.\u201d It\u2019s also uniquely New Jersey, he said. \u201cYou hear traffic; you hear cars rushing by; you hear airplanes flying above ... You hear the construction work going on,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though there are signs that say, \u2018Please observe noble silence,\u2019 you have people laughing, chatting, as they \u2019re coming out to give their offerings.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s on Route 27!\u201d he added, laughing at the untraditional location of such a shrine. \u201cAnd then, the mix of people: you have Sri Lankans...you have Koreans, such as myself, or you have Chinese Mahayanas,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have people who are Indian practicing, you have new Japanese Buddhists coming in, you have Nepalese Buddhists. ... it\u2019s open, and that\u2019s very New Jersey.\u201d The New Jersey Buddhist Vihara, a monastery, follows Theravada, the predominant form practiced in Sri Lanka, Burma and Thailand. But it\u2019s welcoming of all Buddhist traditions and other faiths. When Choi first visited, he was pleasantly surprised to find a statue of Kuan Yin, the Buddhist goddess of compassion who is a prominent figure in Mahayana Buddhism commonly practiced in Tibet, China and Korea. After growing up in a Korean church, he had practiced Zen and Tibetan Buddhism. \u201cFor me that was very welcoming because I thought: \u2019OK, so there\u2019s something for me as well,\u2019\u201d said Choi, holding mala beads in his hand and with a maroon meditation shawl draped over his shoulders as he prepared to chant in front of the statue. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Buddhists of different stripes practicing,\u201d he said, adding that the statue also draws in curious tourists and passersby. \u201cThey just sit in front of the statue on the benches, take in the moment, and just drink in the vibe.\u201d The center\u2019s trees are covered in colorful Tibetan prayer flags that flutter in the wind near an interfaith peace mural painted by local students. It\u2019s decorated with symbols representing different world religions \u2013 from Baha\u2019i and Christianity to Sikhism and Zoroastrianism \u2013 all practiced in the Garden State. \u201cOur Somerset County has become a microcosm of the world,\u201d said Tulsi Majarjan. As a director of the Friends of Nepal-NJ organization, he has led interfaith projects, including the mural and a peace garden. \u201cWhen I first came here to New Jersey 35 years ago, I used to drive all the way to Long Island to go to the Buddhist temple,\u201d he said of the almost the three-hour drive. \u201cNow, within ten minutes...from my home, I can go to the Buddhist temple. But there are so many others,\u201d he said listing nearby Jain, Sikh and Hindu temples that make him proud of the religious diversity in central New Jersey. \u201cAnd obviously, the statue of the Buddha in this temple,\u201d he said. \u201cAnybody who comes to that temple, feels so calm and collected once they see that big Buddha. There\u2019s no magic to it. But you have to be there to feel it.\u201d Carol Kuehn knows that feeling: \u201cIt\u2019s the first thing I look at in the morning,\u201d said the 76-year-old retired high school teacher. From the windows of her home next to the monastery, she awakes to a sight of the impeccably white brick and mortar Buddha sitting on a pink concrete lotus flower. Raised as a Presbyterian, she became interested in Buddhism after reading Herman Hesse\u2019s novel, \u201cSiddhartha.\u201d She also began practicing yoga. But she only became a practicing Buddhist after her saffron-robed neighbors arrived in 2002. Buddhism, she said, helped her deal with grief after the death of her husband. \u201cThe whole point of Buddhism is to live in the moment,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s been a major change in my life, dealing with grief. Meditation gave me a way to focus on the positive.\u201d On a recent chilly evening, she walked a few steps from her house into the monastery home of the center\u2019s abbot, the Venerable Hungampola Sirirathana Nakaya Thero. Surrounded by framed posters of Sri Lanka, they chanted sutras in Pa\u0304li language in front of a flowered-decorated altar overlooking the Buddha in the yard. \u201cIt\u2019s something I can look at and think about the qualities that the Buddha stood for,\u201d Kuehn said. \u201cIt\u2019s peace, understanding, compassion, respect for all and living in the moment.\u201d",

                    "content": "So when u/spriteburn over on the AskReddit subreddit asked the \"ex-nuns of Reddit\" to share what goes on behind the scenes, I ran to the comment section. Former nuns \u2014 and several people who've spent a lot of time with sisters \u2014 had some very interesting responses. Here are some of the best ones: 1. \"I was a religious sister for several years; I took my first vows, which lasted about a year before I decided to leave to take care of my ailing mother. I had every intention of returning but I never did. Not every woman who becomes a religious sister is a virgin. We had one woman who was a single mother who joined us after her son turned 24. A few women had sexual relationships before they started discerning religious life. Our sisters came from all walks of life and all had a rich past before they entered the convent.\" \u2014 u/sistertypo 2. \"Nuns used to come into the gun range where I worked. Mother Superior had a .357 and used to teach the other nuns how to use it. The owner always comped them the range time (charged for ammo though), and a couple of times they even rented AR15s.\" \u2014 u/SMERSH762 3. \"I used to work in a convent for retired nuns. Nuns drink, and the Irish Catholic ones I worked for drank A LOT. From June 21st until Labor Day there was a keg at all times in the cafeteria. During Easter and Christmas, there would be CASES of Johnnie Walker Red and surprisingly, Malibu. Nuns can party harder and longer than you would ever believe. These women were between 65 and 100 drinking straight scotch and beer while playing the piano late into the night.\" \u2014 u/Convergecult15 4. \"Some sisters didn't get along and had to be separated in group tasks.\" \u2014 u/sistertypo 5. \"I used to fantasize about convent life, but then I went on a few retreats and realized that I couldn't deal with the 'institutional' aspect of the life. After a few days of lining up for meals with a tray, I realized that I'd be lining up three times a day to eat cafeteria food that I didn't choose... forever. That was it for me. It wasn't just the meals, but the realization that so much of my everyday life would be decided for me like it would be in any other institution \u2014 school, jail, a hospital. I appreciate all those places, but I don't want to live there!\" \u2014 u/LaLlorana 6. \"Nuns love men. While working with them, getting my ass pinched by a 75-year-old nun became a regular thing. And when the young priest came on Wednesdays to have mass and host theological discussion circles, it was like John Lennon walked into the room.\" \u2014 u/Convergecult15 7. \"We prayed very, very early in the morning. Lots of sisters would fall asleep during prayer, and you could hear a million tummies grumble because you couldn't eat before.\" \u2014 u/sistertypo 8. \"There are lots of convents that don't allow any communication. My sister is a Carmelite nun, and I can't even call her. I only get to see or talk to her when I travel through the town where she lives. Her mail is censored by the mother, and the only communication she gets with the outside world is through some Catholic article that gets released once a month.\" \u2014 u/cj3958 9. \"My aunt was a nun during the '60s and eventually quit. They worked her like a dog fourteen hours a day. To this day, she has knee problems from scrubbing stone floors on her hands and knees. She went in a devout Catholic and came out an atheist.\" \u2014 u/cyclopsrex 10. \"They are a lot bawdier in their humor than you would think. I think they enjoy the shock people have when they use a sexual innuendo.\" \u2014[deleted] 11. \"We had a bunch of cats at the big convent to keep the mouse population down. There were also farm animals and a big old sheep-herding dog. The sisters would always dote on the animals as much as they could, and there was a lot of jealousy if a cat suddenly switched allegiance from one sister to another. At the time, I just thought sisters were kind and loving to all living creatures, but now I see that it was a way to act out a maternal instinct. It was common to catch certain sisters cradling the cats like babies. I thought it was cute at the time, but now I think it is creepy.\" \u2014 u/sistertypo 12. \"I had a lot of interactions with nuns/sisters growing up, including living next door to a house full of them for a few years. They were much cooler than I ever thought. They drank alcohol regularly, listened to music, had card nights, and a few of them smoked cigarettes. They were always lovely to me and my sisters and were surprisingly normal in conversation. Some of them were hilarious to talk to. Of course, they were dedicated to their faith and awake super early doing everything over at the church all day. But come night time, they were surprisingly like everyone else.\" \u2014[deleted] 13. \"The sisters in one of the convents where I stayed cussed like crazy. They didn't use the big cuss words, and they didn't take the Lord's name in vain, so they had to get creative: damn, mother of all things unholy, crap, piss, etc. It was humanizing to see that they also get frustrated by slow internet and the coffee pot not being filled. In my experience, sisters and nuns are pretty much the same as most women. They just have a very specific devotion.\" \u2014 u/SalemScout 14. \"I used to travel for volunteer work in high school and frequently stayed at convents in different places. At the convents where I stayed, all the sisters and nuns were Queen Bee gossips. They knew the who, the what, and the why of everything and everyone in town. Plus, they got downright nasty gossiping about each other, which always made me a little uncomfortable.\" \u2014 u/SalemScout 15. \"The sisters and I had a lot of work to do all the time, so it was like having a 9-5. Then you would go home and play games and watch TV, maybe drink a glass of wine or two on the weekends. Lots of prayer before regular activities like washing the car or buying new shoes, which always annoyed me.\" \u2014 u/sistertypo 16. \"I worked with nuns for a decade. My boss was a nun, my coworkers were nuns, my friends were nuns, the whole bit. I think what others found most surprising was how normal everyone was. People thought because they devoted their lives to their religion, they didn't do anything else. Like any workplace, there were different cliques. The cliques would argue and talk smack, but everyone was very proper when they were around outsiders.\" \u2014 u/Strange_and_Unusual 17. And finally, \"I worked at a grocery store in a town with a large convent. The nuns went to my store every week and I got to know some of them well. They have movie and game nights, make crafts for injured veterans or refugee children, and study A LOT. They seem to get lonely too, because people don't regard nuns as someone you can 'hang out' with. They don't see them as real people, which they are. Overall, they are good, normal women all shoved up together with a lot of time on their hands.\" \u2014[deleted] Have you had any interesting interactions with nuns?

                    "content": "It appeared unexpectedly in the middle of a backyard just off a state highway in New Jersey . One of the largest statues of the Buddha in the United States rises 30 feet high from the woods in Franklin Township, near Princeton. It was built a decade ago under the leadership of a Sri Lankan monk ordained in Theravada, one of the oldest forms of Buddhism.

                    "content": "The United Nations declared December 10 every year as International Human Rights Day, mainly to highlight the rights now recognized globally as enuring to and enjoyed by human beings by virtue of their humanity. Although there is still so much ground to cover in the areas of protection of human rights, the decision to set aside a day for this purpose has helped in no small measure to draw global attention to the issue. I was one of the guest speakers of the Human Rights Committee of the Premier Bar on December 10, 2024, where I shared my thoughts on the topic. Introduction: According to Anto\u0301nio Guterres, the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General, \u201chuman rights are under assault... This year\u2019s [2024\u2019s] theme reminds us that human rights are about building the future \u2014 right now... We must stand up for all rights \u2013 always.\u201d Guterres\u2019 bird\u2019s-eye view on the global crises against HRs from the vintage of global leadership undoubtedly provides us with a global big picture which is a true reflection of the stark reality of the crises beleaguering HRs right from the pinnacle of the intercontinental stage, through the international, down to national/local scenes. Guterres\u2019 observation is an echo of this year\u2019s theme: Our Rights, Our Future, Right Now. At the intercontinental and international scenes HRs crises of epic proportions as seen, for instance, in the outrageous wars involving Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Gaza/Hezbollah and allied Middle Eastern forces; together with other sundry abuses of HRs are blood-cuddling to say the least. Back home in Nigeria, the incidences of decimation of HRs through indiscriminate destruction of lives and property through acts of terror, political crimes, banditry, kidnapping, grievous sexual assaults, domestic violence, etc. give us all a reason to worry. However, in a manner of speaking, Human Rights (HRs), with its global crusade has come a long way. Indeed, it is no longer the infant it once was, though we are yet to see it mature into the adult we all hope it ought to be. In the meantime, let us commemorate a milestone of an HRs global movement, albeit in its adolescence. Shall we? Conceptual clarifications on key terms: Rights: The concept of rights, as is typical with most legal concepts, is as multifaceted and poly-dimensional in meaning as there are jurisprudential schools of thought. To begin with, the Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines rights as something that is just, morally correct, and in accordance with ethical principles or the rules of positive law. It also defines a right as the capacity to control the actions of others with the assistance of the state. Without necessarily allowing ourselves to descend into the depths of the wells of a jurisprudence class on the concept of rights in all its academic nuances, we may further explore a few classical definitions of the most notable legal philosophers of global repute within the realms of jurisprudence. Hugo Grotius (1583\u20131645) often considered as the father of international law defined a right as a \u201cmoral quality of a person, making it possible to have or do something lawfully.\u201d Immanuel Kant (1724 \u2013 1804) describes rights as the \u201ccapacity to constrain others in accordance with universal laws of freedom.\u201d On his own part, Jeremy Bentham (1748\u20131832), dismissing the idea of natural rights, saw rights rather as creation of law, deriving existence and legitimacy from legal systems rather than from moral or natural law. From his positivist standpoint, John Austin (1790\u20131859) defined a right as a legally enforceable claim. He viewed rights as rooted in the commands of a sovereign and contingent on the existence of law. H.L.A. Hart (1907\u20131992), on his part, argued that a right is a protected interest or choice that individuals can exercise. His emphasis was on the connection between rights and duties. Wesley Hohfeld (1879\u20131818) espoused the relational and reciprocal nature of rights. According to him, rights are a system of jural relations, such as claims, duties, powers, and immunities. The above definitions cut across Natural, Positivist, Utilitarian, etc viewpoints. A more contemporary approach, however, would leave us with the notion that rights encompass moral principles, enforceable claims, or relational constructs or structures ensuring justice and fairness; hence the axiom ubi jus, ibi remedium. Human rights: Putting it in its simplest expression, HRs may be defined as the freedoms, immunities and benefits that, according to modern values, all human beings should be able to claim as a matter of right in the society in which they live. According to the UN, HRs may be defined as: Rights inherent to all human beings, regardless of race, sex, nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, or any other status. Human rights include the right to life and liberty, freedom from slavery and torture, freedom of opinion and expression, the right to work and education, and many more. Everyone is entitled to these rights, without discrimination. Certain cardinal pillars of HRs as espoused by the UN include: Universality: All people are born with the same rights, regardless of their race, sex, nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, or any other status; Inalienability: People\u2019s rights can never be taken away; Indivisibility: All rights are equal in importance and none can be fully enjoyed without the others, Interdependence: All rights are related and must be treated as such; Fundamentality: Human rights include the right to life and liberty, freedom from slavery and torture, freedom of opinion and expression, the right to work and education, and many more and Govern how people live: Human rights govern how individuals live in society and with each other, as well as their relationship with the State. Human rights vs. fundamental rights: The distinction between Human Rights (HRs) and Fundamental Rights (FRs) is only a little short of the distinction between six and half a dozen in that both concepts refer largely to the same substance. Traditionally, the term FRs is used in a constitutional context whereas the term HRs is used in international law. By Order 1 Rule 2 of the Fundamental Rights (Enforcement Procedure) Rules, 2009 \u201dFundamental Right\u201d and \u201cHuman Right\u201d are defined in the following manner:- \u201cFundamental Right \u2013 means any of the rights provided for in Chapter IV of the Constitution, and includes any of the rights stipulated in the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act. Human Rights \u2013 includes fundamental rights. Eso, J.S.C. in Ransome-Kuti v. A-G. Federation, (1985) LPELR-2940(SC) on the nature and meaning of FRs, has this to say: ...What is the nature of a fundamental right? It is a right which stands above the ordinary laws of the land and which in fact is antecedent to the political society itself. It is a primary condition to a civilized existence and what has been done by our constitution since independence, starting with the Independence Constitution that is: the Nigeria (Constitution) Order in Council 1960 up to the present Constitution that is the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1979 (the latter does not in fact apply to this case: it is the 1963 Constitution that applies) is to have these rights enshrined in the Constitution so that the rights could be \u201cimmutable\u201d to the extent of the \u201cnon-immutability\u201d of the Constitution itself. [Emphasis supplied]. As such, FRs are those HRs trapped and domiciled or better still, entrenched within the documentary four walls of a Constitution or statute. HRs, on the other hand, extends beyond FRs, and embraces all those God-endowed rights intrinsic to the human person by virtue of his humanity. In our Nigerian context, the locus of the FRs is Chapter IV of the Constitution comprising Sections 33 to 46 thereof. FRs may also be found in the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act. A brief historical background on the UDHR: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly on the 10th of December, 1948. Like the UN itself, UDHR rose from the ashes of World War II. When it was adopted in 1948, much of the world was still recovering from the sore wounds of the deadliest conflict in history, which claimed more than 60 million lives. In the aftermath of such unprecedented death and destruction of lives and property, the world turned to diplomacy to make sure history would not repeat itself. Nations came together for the first time to publicly declare the fundamental freedoms that belong to all of us. The Commission on Human Rights was set up, chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt, the First Lady of the United States of America (from 1933 to 1945) and tasked with the responsibility of composing the UDHR. Roosevelt asserted the Declaration would reflect more than Western ideas; to accomplish this, the Human Rights Commission was made up of members from various cultural and legal backgrounds from all around the world, showing respect for differing cultures and their customs while also ensuring each region had a hand in creating the document. Under Roosevelt\u2019s leadership, the diverse commission was able to craft the UDHR in a unique and culturally competent way. The UDHR contains a preamble and 30 articles outlining our most basic birth rights, including protection against torture, inhumane treatment, cruel punishment, slavery, and servitude. It covers both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights. The document heralded a new chapter of human history.

                    "content": "This reminds us of groups like Jewish Voice for Peace, who stand with Hamas and accuse Israel of genocide. We're not familiar with U.S. Catholic magazine, but they assure us that saints and key figures dating back to the dawn of Catholicism were what we'd today consider nonbinary and that gender diversity has always been a part of the Church. Gender diversity has been part of the Catholic Church since the very beginning, as saints and key Catholic figures lived as what we would today call nonbinary or trans to mirror a God who supersedes all human constructs. https://t.co/WnH6gmazpv The magazine's \"about the author\" blurb tells us: Emma Cieslik (she/her) is a queer Catholic scholar focused on material culture and LGBTQ+ identity within the church. She founded and directs Queer and Catholic, A CLGS Oral History Project based out of the Pacific School of Religion. Cieslik writes: The church\u2019s gender foundations are cracking\u2014its scaffolding of doctrinal semantics and conflicting guidance from Pope Francis and the Vatican buckling under pressure for LGBTQ+ inclusion, women\u2019s ordination, and abortion rights. At its core is church leadership\u2019s fear of \u201cideological colonization,\u201d or the spread of western gender values to a traditional church. But if the church pushes for modernization, a progressive view of gender must be part of it. ... ... Western colonizers have historically forced patriarchal and queerphobic gender ideologies onto Indigenous communities around the world. The Catholic Church has been instrumental in these changes, so to argue that the church is somehow separate or fighting \u201cideological colonization\u201d flatly contradicts church history. Even more, Dignitas Infinita closely mirrors attempts in European and American countries to deny trans, nonbinary, and queer people\u2019s access to gender affirming health care, restrooms, and important identification documents, including driver\u2019s licenses and birth certificates. Many Americans could argue that Dignitas Infinita falls in line with modern American conservative values; there are currently more than 400 anti-LGBTQ+ bills on the American docket today. Is there anything Western colonizers can't do? Trans activists never fail to bring up that there are more than 400 \"anti-LGBTQ\" bills being considered without mentioning that most of them have to do with outlawing child mutilation. \"The genderqueer identity of these saints is largely what distinguished them as divine and was highlighted in art as evidence of their closeness to God,\" Cieslik writes, naming zero examples of nonbinary saints. I\u2019ve never wanted John Paul II to come back and kick anyone\u2019s ass as much as I have whomever was involved in writing or publishing this nonsense. However many Hail Mary\u2019s you\u2019re saying this week, it\u2019s not enough. Really starting to hate Catholicism. This is revisionist history. No Catholic actually believes this. So... You don't have anyone who works at @USCatholic who knows about the Church's history or dogma... pic.twitter.com/oWF6Yzy3Fp Quick request: remove \"Catholic\" from your name, thanks. I worry it might confuse people. No, they did not, it has not been and God made us male and female. And this is not remotely Catholic. This editor is not a theologian, but isn't the creation of Adam and Eve sort of \"imposing\" the gender binary? What is it with Catholics lately? The Vatican has a Palestinian Jesus that the Pope is enamored with, Catholics for Choice or whoever they are speculate about Mary aborting Jesus, and now you guys are denigrating your own history. What the hell? As we reported earlier this month, Catholics for Choice posted, \"This holiday season, remember that Mary had a choice, and you should, too.\" There is nothing Catholic about this account This is possibly the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever read on this app. We'd cancel our subscriptions to U.S. Catholic magazine if we had known it existed. In other news, it's been a great week for Catholicism with the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. ***",

                    "description": "To the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, I am not an employee or a contractor. Yet they maintain they can dictate what I can and cannot say.",
                    "content": "I am a concert pianist who has performed with major orchestras around the world. On August 11, I performed the world premiere of Witness by Australian composer Connor D\u2019Netto at the Iwaki Auditorium in a solo recital presented by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. This haunting new work was dedicated to Palestinian journalists killed in Gaza, and before playing it, I felt it was important to share this context with the audience. Pianist Jayson Gillham was criticised for making pro-Palestinian comments at a Melbourne Symphony Orchestra concert. \u201cOver the last 10 months, Israel has killed more than 100 Palestinian journalists. A number of these have been targeted assassinations of prominent journalists as they were travelling in marked press vehicles or wearing their press jackets,\u201d I said. \u201cThe killing of journalists is a war crime in international law, and it is done in an effort to prevent the documentation and broadcasting of war crimes to the world. In addition to the role of journalists who bear witness, the word witness in Arabic is shaheed, which also means martyr.\u201d As an artist concerned with human rights, I believed this background would deepen the audience\u2019s understanding of the piece. I did not expect what followed. The next day, the MSO terminated my contract and cancelled my scheduled Melbourne Town Hall performance. On November 7, they filed their written defence to my workplace discrimination claim in the Federal Court. Their position is extraordinary. They want to make artists like me disappear entirely from workplace law. According to the MSO\u2019s defence, I exist in a peculiar legal limbo. I am not an employee. I am not a contractor. In fact, they claim I have no connection to the MSO whatsoever. Yet paradoxically, they maintain they can dictate what I can and cannot say, cancel my performances at will, and deny me any avenue for legal recourse. Let\u2019s be clear about what this means: if the MSO\u2019s position is accepted, no engaged artist with any of Australia\u2019s six state orchestras would have any legal protection from discrimination whatsoever. Not just regarding political expression, but on any ground \u2013 gender, race, sexuality, religion, or any other protected attribute. This is not hyperbole; it is the logical conclusion of their legal argument. This case extends far beyond my individual situation. It arrives at a time when other prominent Australian voices face similar challenges. Journalists Mary Kostakidis and Antoinette Lattouf are currently battling their own legal cases defending their right to free expression. These are not isolated incidents but represent a troubling pattern of attempts to silence dissenting voices. The potential implications for Australia\u2019s artistic community are profound. If major cultural institutions can claim they have no legal relationship with their performing artists, while simultaneously asserting control over their speech, we face a future where artists must choose between their conscience and their career. This creates a chilling effect on artistic expression that undermines the very purpose of art in our society. Consider what this means for young artists contemplating their futures. Should they expect to work in an environment where they have no workplace protections? Where their engagement can be terminated without cause if they express views that make management uncomfortable? Where they must constantly self-censor for fear of offending the wrong people? This is not the future I want for Australian arts. Our cultural institutions should be bastions of free expression, not enforcers of silence. They should protect artists\u2019 rights, not seek to eliminate them through legal technicalities. The MSO\u2019s defence represents a critical juncture for artistic freedom in Australia. Their position effectively asks the court to create a class of workers who exist outside the protection of our discrimination laws. This would set a dangerous precedent that could affect generations of artists to come. As this case proceeds, I call on the broader arts community to consider its implications carefully. This is not just about one pianist or one orchestra \u2013 it\u2019s about defining the relationship between artists and institutions in our country. It\u2019s about whether we truly value artistic freedom and are willing to protect it under law. The MSO management needs to reflect carefully on whether they want their legacy to be the erosion of artists\u2019 rights in Australia. Their current position not only threatens the legal protections of countless performing artists but also risks damaging the reputation of one of Australia\u2019s most respected cultural institutions. The choice before them is clear: they can continue down this path of denying artists\u2019 basic legal protections, or they can acknowledge that artists deserve both respect and legal recognition. The entire arts community will be watching their decision. Jayson Gillham is an internationally acclaimed concert pianist who has performed with leading orchestras worldwide.

                    "content": "I am a concert pianist who has performed with major orchestras around the world. On August 11, I performed the world premiere of Witness by Australian composer Connor D\u2019Netto at the Iwaki Auditorium in a solo recital presented by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. This haunting new work was dedicated to Palestinian journalists killed in Gaza, and before playing it, I felt it was important to share this context with the audience. Pianist Jayson Gillham was criticised for making pro-Palestinian comments at a Melbourne Symphony Orchestra concert. \u201cOver the last 10 months, Israel has killed more than 100 Palestinian journalists. A number of these have been targeted assassinations of prominent journalists as they were travelling in marked press vehicles or wearing their press jackets,\u201d I said. \u201cThe killing of journalists is a war crime in international law, and it is done in an effort to prevent the documentation and broadcasting of war crimes to the world. In addition to the role of journalists who bear witness, the word witness in Arabic is shaheed, which also means martyr.\u201d As an artist concerned with human rights, I believed this background would deepen the audience\u2019s understanding of the piece. I did not expect what followed. Loading The next day, the MSO terminated my contract and cancelled my scheduled Melbourne Town Hall performance. On November 7, they filed their written defence to my workplace discrimination claim in the Federal Court. Their position is extraordinary. They want to make artists like me disappear entirely from workplace law. According to the MSO\u2019s defence, I exist in a peculiar legal limbo. I am not an employee. I am not a contractor. In fact, they claim I have no connection to the MSO whatsoever. Yet paradoxically, they maintain they can dictate what I can and cannot say, cancel my performances at will, and deny me any avenue for legal recourse. Let\u2019s be clear about what this means: if the MSO\u2019s position is accepted, no engaged artist with any of Australia\u2019s six state orchestras would have any legal protection from discrimination whatsoever. Not just regarding political expression, but on any ground \u2013 gender, race, sexuality, religion, or any other protected attribute. This is not hyperbole; it is the logical conclusion of their legal argument. This case extends far beyond my individual situation. It arrives at a time when other prominent Australian voices face similar challenges. Journalists Mary Kostakidis and Antoinette Lattouf are currently battling their own legal cases defending their right to free expression. These are not isolated incidents but represent a troubling pattern of attempts to silence dissenting voices. Loading The potential implications for Australia\u2019s artistic community are profound. If major cultural institutions can claim they have no legal relationship with their performing artists, while simultaneously asserting control over their speech, we face a future where artists must choose between their conscience and their career. This creates a chilling effect on artistic expression that undermines the very purpose of art in our society. Consider what this means for young artists contemplating their futures. Should they expect to work in an environment where they have no workplace protections? Where their engagement can be terminated without cause if they express views that make management uncomfortable? Where they must constantly self-censor for fear of offending the wrong people? This is not the future I want for Australian arts. Our cultural institutions should be bastions of free expression, not enforcers of silence. They should protect artists\u2019 rights, not seek to eliminate them through legal technicalities. The MSO\u2019s defence represents a critical juncture for artistic freedom in Australia. Their position effectively asks the court to create a class of workers who exist outside the protection of our discrimination laws. This would set a dangerous precedent that could affect generations of artists to come. Loading As this case proceeds, I call on the broader arts community to consider its implications carefully. This is not just about one pianist or one orchestra \u2013 it\u2019s about defining the relationship between artists and institutions in our country. It\u2019s about whether we truly value artistic freedom and are willing to protect it under law. The MSO management needs to reflect carefully on whether they want their legacy to be the erosion of artists\u2019 rights in Australia. Their current position not only threatens the legal protections of countless performing artists but also risks damaging the reputation of one of Australia\u2019s most respected cultural institutions. The choice before them is clear: they can continue down this path of denying artists\u2019 basic legal protections, or they can acknowledge that artists deserve both respect and legal recognition. The entire arts community will be watching their decision. Jayson Gillham is an internationally acclaimed concert pianist who has performed with leading orchestras worldwide.

                    "content": "Abu Dhabi: In a quiet, atmospherically-lit gallery in Wing 2 of Louvre Abu Dhabi, one of four within the museum\u2019s masterful spaces, visitors will find fascinating artefacts from the world\u2019s sacred texts. These artefacts narrate the story of universal religions that emerged over 2,000 years ago, spreading across Europe, Asia, and Africa within just a few centuries. By addressing their messages to all humanity without distinction, these religions transcended local cultural characteristics and profoundly transformed communities that thrived during antiquity. These religions shared the idea of monotheism \u2013 the belief in one God - but differed on their representation of the divine. While their roots lay in ancient religions, the rise of universal religions marked a unifying force that brought communities together and influenced intellectual and artistic pursuits across continents. Among Louvre Abu Dhabi\u2019s sacred texts is the Juz\u2019 Amma, the 30th section of a Holy Quran, dating from approximately 1250\u20131300 CE, during the Mamluk Dynasty. \u201cThis section probably originating from Syria was acquired by the museum in 2009,\u201d explains Mariam AlDhaheri, a curatorial assistant at Louvre Abu Dhabi. \u201cThe exhibits in Gallery 4, which is dedicated to Universal Religions, truly embody the museum's narrative. They showcase different cultures side by side throughout history, highlighting their commonalities.\u201d AlDhaheri has honed her expertise in conveying Louvre Abu Dhabi\u2019s unique narrative to global audiences. Her close to 10-year career began in the museum\u2019s communications department, where she introduced international journalists to the museum\u2019s unique curatorial approach. The first universal museum in the Arab world, Louvre Abu Dhabi showcases artworks from different cultures side by side. It tells stories of human creativity that transcend civilisations, geographies, and times, fostering understanding across cultures. \u201cAs someone who is half Emirati and half French, I grew up visiting the Muse\u0301e du Louvre in Paris with my grandmother. Being part of Louvre Abu Dhabi\u2019s story is a profound privilege; the museum feels like a part of my identity,\u201d she says. The Juz\u2019 Amma, in Louvre Abu Dhabi\u2019s collection is the final Juz in the Holy Quran and its chapters, or Suras, are written on paper in ink and decoratively illuminated in gold. \u201cThis kind of work may have taken a lifetime to produce by the calligrapher who worked on it,\u201d explains AlDhaheri. \u201cThere would have been an artist working on the illuminations and when you think that they could not make one mistake at the risk of having to start again, it was a slow and painstaking task.\u201d For Muslim calligraphers, their art was also a genuinely spiritual experience bound in honour, as they carefully formed the different calligraphic styles - Kufic, characterised by its angular letters, and the cursive forms of Naskh. The Quran shares its gallery with sacred texts and scriptures from other religions including a Bible and a Torah. According to AlDhaheri, this arrangement complements the nearby Abrahamic Family House in Saadiyat Cultural District. \u201cBoth the gallery and the Abrahamic Family House symbolise the shared values of Islamic, Christian and Jewish faiths as well as our universal message of diversity, mutual respect, and knowledge sharing,\u201d she says. This journey through the foundational texts of faith was celebrated last year at Louvre Abu Dhabi in the Letters of Light (13 September 2023 - 14 January 2024) exhibition. The exhibition showcased some of the most exquisite sacred books ever created, highlighting the work of skilled calligraphers, bookbinders, and artists who used precious pigments and illuminated calligraphy. Featuring over 240 artefacts, Letters of Light demonstrated how the production techniques and designs of sacred texts evolved over centuries, reflecting shared artistic influences among the three major religions. As for the precious Section from a Quran in the museum\u2019s Universal Religions gallery, it is currently being rested as part of a meticulous preservation process. Visitors can still explore its history through digital displays in the gallery, which provide images and descriptions of the text during its hiatus. \u201cWe rotate sensitive ancient artefacts including manuscripts three times a year to ensure they are stored in ideal environmental conditions,\u201d AlDhaheri explains. \u201cThe gallery\u2019s subdued lighting also protects these works. They are not just for our generation; we aim to preserve them for centuries to come.\u201d The Louvre Abu Dhabi\u2019s Research Laboratory plays a vital role in conserving artefacts for future generations, advancing both art historical research and preservation science. \u201cIt\u2019s essential and deeply fulfilling work,\u201d says AlDhaheri. The museum also inspires young people to pursue careers in cultural industries. \u201cMy friend Moza Alnaqbi, an assistant researcher, works in the lab, while Noora Alzaabi, a documentation photographer, uses scientific photography to uncover artifact layers. Additionally, my artist friends, Aisha AlAhmadi and Maitha Alomaira, have joined the curatorial team,\u201d she adds. \u201cLouvre Abu Dhabi empowers young Emiratis to build careers in cultural industries, fulfilling its mission, and that of the Saadiyat Cultural District, to advance knowledge, creativity, and cultural exchange.\u201d - In collaboration with Saadiyat Cultural District Abu Dhabi",

                    "description": "Human Rights Day is observed annually on December 10, commemorating the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. Widely regarded as a cornerstone of global human rights advocacy, the UDHR enshrines the ideals of freedom, equality, and dignity for all individuals. This year\u2019s theme, \u201cOur Rights, Our Future, Right Now\u201d, highlights the urgent need to translate human rights principles into immediate action for a more equitable and sustainable future. The UDHR, proclaimed in Paris, stands as a universal blueprint for protecting the inalienable rights of all individuals, regardless of race, religion, gender, or other status. It has been instrumental in shaping global and national laws, and its principles are deeply embedded in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Highlighting the day\u2019s significance, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) stated, \u201cHuman Rights Day is an opportunity for various stakeholders to reflect on their responsibilities and ensure they do not contribute to violations of human rights.\u201d UN Secretary-General Anto\u0301nio Guterres reinforced this sentiment, noting that human rights are foundational for peaceful and inclusive societies. A UN resolution further emphasized that by embracing the full potential of human rights, humanity can forge a better future, with these principles serving as a preventative and transformative force. However, amidst global observances, urgent attention is needed on the atrocities faced by Hindus in Bangladesh. Reports of targeted violence, discrimination, and attacks on minority communities in the region highlight persistent human rights violations. Temples have been desecrated, homes destroyed, and individuals targeted simply for their religious identity, raising questions about the effectiveness of international frameworks in safeguarding vulnerable communities. Advocacy groups have called for greater international intervention and accountability to address these issues. Human Rights Day serves as a reminder that human rights must extend to every individual, and violations\u2014whether systemic or isolated\u2014must be addressed urgently. Ancient Indian Traditions and the Concept of Human Rights India\u2019s rich cultural heritage reflects a profound commitment to human rights, deeply rooted in its ancient traditions. From the moral philosophies of the Vedic era to the constitutional framework of modern India, the idea of fundamental rights has been a central theme. Ancient Indian scriptures, such as the Rigveda and epics like the Ramcharitmanas, resonate with values of equality, justice, and freedom. Historically, Indian society prioritized social justice, upholding the dignity of individuals beyond distinctions of caste or creed. In ancient texts like the Gautama Dharmasutra, the responsibilities of rulers were clearly defined, emphasizing the protection of all beings, fair governance, and guiding individuals toward righteousness. Similarly, texts like the Arthashastra and the Mahabharata present an ideal model of governance, asserting that the happiness and welfare of the people are intrinsically linked to the responsibilities of the ruler. The role of women in ancient Indian society also highlights the inclusive nature of its traditions. Women not only had access to education but were revered as scholars, poets, and thinkers. Notable female figures, such as Vishwara of the Atrikula and Apala, contributed to the Rigveda, while Gargi participated in philosophical debates in the court of King Janaka. This reflects a society where women held significant intellectual and social rights, which were supported by an education system that promoted accessibility and equality. The idea of human rights in the Hindu perspective has gained global recognition. Prestigious universities like Oxford, Cambridge, and Harvard have included the Hindu viewpoint on human rights as a subject of study, emphasizing its relevance in the modern era. The Hindu philosophy of human rights aligns with the principles of international human rights frameworks, resonating with the goals of global peace and social equity. India\u2019s constitution, crafted after centuries of colonial rule, reaffirms these values by enshrining fundamental rights. The commitment of Indian traditions to freedom of thought, worship, and equality continues to influence global discussions, with international organizations like the United Nations acknowledging these contributions. Human Rights Day In India Bharat\u2019s National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), established under the Protection of Human Rights Act (PHRA) in 1993, has upheld these ideals for over three decades. As a vanguard of human rights protection in the country, the NHRC plays a critical role in addressing violations, raising awareness, and influencing policies that safeguard individual and collective rights. Since its inception on October 12, 1993, the NHRC has been instrumental in addressing human rights concerns across Bharat. By November 2024, the Commission had registered a staggering 23,14,794 cases and disposed of 23,07,587. Among these, 2,880 cases were taken up suo motu, reflecting the NHRC\u2019s proactive stance on critical issues. Over the years, it has recommended monetary relief amounting to Rs 256.57 lakh to victims, a testament to its commitment to justice and accountability. In the past year alone (December 2023 to November 2024), the Commission registered 65,973 cases, resolving 66,378, including backlogs. It initiated suo motu proceedings in 109 cases and recommended an impressive Rs 17.24 crore in monetary relief. Notably, the NHRC held a special camp in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, as part of its outreach efforts to address human rights issues directly at the community level. The NHRC\u2019s work spans a wide array of human rights concerns. It has taken decisive action in cases ranging from workplace harassment of women in sports to advocating for free housing for the homeless and compensating victims of communal riots. The Commission has also addressed farmer suicides due to indebtedness and recommended changes to 97 discriminatory laws against persons with Hansen\u2019s disease. Key advisories issued by the NHRC have covered critical issues such as: Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) Mental health Informal workers\u2019 rights The right to food and health Environmental pollution These advisories, coupled with reviews of bills, laws, and conferences, underscore the NHRC\u2019s role as both a protector and promoter of human rights in Bharat.

Additionally, 21 Special Monitors focus on specific human rights themes, ensuring a sustained effort in addressing pressing issues. The Commission\u2019s 12 core groups on various human rights themes engage with experts and government officials to formulate well-rounded recommendations. Open house discussions and national consultations further facilitate multi-stakeholder dialogue, ensuring comprehensive solutions. Recognising the importance of education in promoting human rights, the NHRC has prioritised outreach and capacity-building initiatives. In the past year: A new program introduced this year focused on sensitising IAS, IPS, and IFS officers, equipping them with a deeper understanding of human rights. This initiative is designed to ensure that human rights principles are integrated into governance at all levels. The NHRC\u2019s HRCNet Portal has revolutionised public access to justice. By connecting with state authorities and integrating with over five lakh Common Service Centers and the National Government Services Portal, the platform enables individuals to file complaints online and track their status in real time. This initiative demonstrates the Commission\u2019s commitment to leveraging technology for greater inclusivity and efficiency.",

                    "content": "New Delhi: Since 2014, India has been living in its \u201c Amrit Kaal \u201d, Allahabad High Court judge Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav had proclaimed at Attlee Room in the UK House of Lords in September. India couldn\u2019t progress at the pace at which it should have, despite power changing hands, but since 2014, it has been our \u201c Amrit Kaal, \u201d the judge said. More recently, Justice Yadav kicked up a storm with controversial comments he made at an event organised Sunday by Vishwa Hindu Parishad\u2019s legal cell , where he in an apparent reference to Muslims said, \u201c Kathmullah ... are fatal for the country.\u201d Back in September, he also said that India is \u201cnow marching ahead on the path of development and in the process, we have reached the moon.\u201d \u201c... We showed the world that during an epidemic like Covid, which was killing people, we made our own vaccine, and saved lakhs of people.\u201d ThePrint has seen a video of his Attlee Room speech. He also said that the country stands at fifth spot in terms of size of economy, and said, \u201cLook at the vision of our Prime Minister, who says within 3-4 years we\u2019ll reach the third spot, and by 2047, we\u2019d be number 1.\u201d \u201cThis is the sort of vision the Prime Minister of our country holds,\u201d he added. The judge was honored with the Global Prestige Award 2024 at Attlee Hall, in an event titled \u2018Trailblazers of India: Pioneering the path of Viksit Bharat 2047\u2019. The award was presented by Lord Bellamy K.C. and Lord Rami Ranger to several academicians, judges, journalists and entrepreneurs. In his speech at the time, the judge asserted that cows, [ Bhagavad ] Gita and Ganga form the culture of India. Hundreds of years ago, India was very developed, and was called the golden bird, he said. He also said that the Hindu deities Ram and Krishna taught us how to live life, how to handle a family, or how to run a country and the society. While speaking Sunday on \u201c Uniform Civil Code: A Constitutional Imperative ,\u201d the judge asked how \u201ctheir children\u201d would be kind and tolerant when animals were being slaughtered in front of them since childhood. He said not everybody from this community is bad, but remarked \u201c kathmullas ... are fatal for the country\u201d. \u201cThe law works as per the majority. Look at families or the society, wherever there is a majority, people agree to it,\u201d he further said. Justice Yadav graduated from Allahabad University in 1988, and enrolled as an advocate in 1990. He then began practicing at the Allahabad High Court and also worked as the additional government advocate and standing counsel for the state government. He was elevated as an additional judge of the high court in December 2019, and confirmed as a permanent judge in March 2021. Within months, he began making headlines, passing judgments advocating for making cows the national animal, bestowing national honor on the deities Ram and Krishna, and asserting that when the majority community converts, it weakens the country. Also Read: Allahabad HC judges participate in VHP event, draw flak for \u2018gross violation of secular principles\u2019 In July 2021, months after becoming a permanent judge, Justice Yadav shot to internet fame when he passed an eight-page order in Hindi asserting there is no place for religious fanaticism, greed, fear and intimidation in India. He pointed out that everybody is free to accept any religion they want to, and can also marry a person of any religion\u2014a right given to us by the Constitution. He then said that sometimes people convert to other religions not because of fear or greed, but because they face insults in their own religion, and feel they would receive respect in another religion. \u201cWhen a person does not get respect in his own home, he leaves the home. Similarly, if he does not get respect in a religion while living there, then he has full right to convert his religion,\u201d he said. \u201cThose religious custodians who insult people on caste basis should reform themselves otherwise when the majority of citizens of any country change their religion after getting insulted then the country becomes weak and the disruptive forces of the country get the benefit of this,\u201d he went on to assert. The court was hearing a bail application filed by one Javed alias Jabid Ansari, booked under the UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020. Ansari was accused of unlawfully and forcefully converting a Hindu girl for the purpose of marrying her. Justice Yadav rejected his bail plea, while asserting that religion is a matter of faith, and devotion and that it cannot be tied to any method of worship. A good example of this, he said, was Emperor Akbar and his wife Jodha Bai. In a judgment passed on 1 September 2021, Justice Yadav advocated for a law for declaring the cow as the \u201cnational animal\u201d, and for stricter laws against those who talk of harming the cows. The court was hearing a bail plea of a man, Javed, who was booked under the UP prevention of cow slaughter law. In the 12-page judgment in Hindi, the judge rejected his bail, and claimed scientists believe cows are the only animal which takes in oxygen and releases oxygen. He referred to the Vedas and other religious texts to underscore the importance of the cow in Hinduism, and pointed out that Muslim rulers and leaders in the past have also considered cows an important part of Indian culture. He also asserted that \u201ccow protection should be made a fundamental right of Hindus because we know that when the culture and faith of the country is hurt, the country becomes weak\u201d. He went on to state that fundamental rights are not just the privilege of those who eat beef. \u201cThose who worship cows and live economically on cows also have the right to live a meaningful life. Someone\u2019s right to life cannot be snatched away just for the taste of the tongue of some people and the right to life is above the right to kill and the right to eat beef can never be a fundamental right,\u201d he added. Justice Yadav further observed that the work of cow protection and conservation is not the work of one religion or sect. He said cows are a part of Indian culture, and it is the work of every citizen of the country to save this culture, irrespective of their religion or worship. \u201cIf this does not happen, there are hundreds of examples in our country that whenever we forgot our culture, the foreigners attacked and enslaved us. If we do not wake up even today, we should not forget the attack and occupation of Afghanistan by the tyrannical Taliban,\u201d he had proceeded to warn. Also Read: From Ayodhya to Ajmer Sharif, how deities have fought mandir-masjid lawsuits as legal entities A month later, in October 2021, Justice Yadav passed another judgment observing that the deities Ram, Krishna, the Ramayana , Gita and its creators Maharishi Valmiki and Maharishi Ved Vyas need to be given \u201cnational honor\u201d through a law brought by Parliament. He opined that this should be made a compulsory subject in schools and children should be educated \u201cbecause only through education does a person become cultured and become aware of his life values and his culture.\u201d The observations were made while the court granted bail to one Akash Jatav alias Surya Prakash, who had allegedly made obscene remarks against the deities Ram and Krishna on Facebook. While the judge did grant him bail, he observed that the posts were an attack on faith of the majority of the people of India, and if courts treat such people with leniency, their morale will increase and their conduct will disturb harmony in the country. In the 12-page judgment in Hindi, Justice Yadav also pointed out that the Supreme Court had, after years, ruled \u201cin favour of the followers of Ram\u201d in the Ramjnmabhoomi\u2013Babri Masjid case. This, he said, showed that \u201cRam resided in the heart of every citizen of this country\u201d. He claimed that Ram was popular even among Muslims. He went on to also highlight the fact that the Constitution has a sketch of Ram as well, and observed, \u201cThe writers of the Indian Constitution also understood that the Indian Constitution cannot be imagined without Ram and Krishna, who are the soul of India, and today Ram and Krishna reside in the heart of every Indian citizen\u201d. More recently, in February this year, Justice Yadav noted that the court comes across several cases in which initially an FIR is filed under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code or POCSO Act or SC/ST Act, and the victims as well as their family members receive compensation from the government. However, after passage of some time, the victims become hostile, or do not support the prosecution\u2019s case. \u201cThe time and the money of the investigators and the court gets wasted. This kind of practice needs to stop and action should be taken against whoever has lodged such an FIR,\u201d he then asserted, batting for appropriate action to be taken against victims who turn hostile during trial after receiving compensation from the government. In another order passed on 23 October this year, Justice Yadav ordered a potency test on a man arrested in a dowry case. The order was passed while the court was hearing a bail application filed by one Moni alias Monu, who had submitted that his wife died by suicide as she was depressed after being unable to conceive. However, Justice Yadav observed that while lawyers often claim that the victim in such cases was unable to become pregnant and therefore died by suicide out of depression, \u201csometimes the man himself is incapable of conceiving\u201d.

                    "content": "I wish I could say that Mary, mother of God, riding a horse through a wall of fire was the worst thing about Netflix\u2019s Mary. As an unrepentant fan of some truly unrealistic films, I can forgive a lot of entertaining embellishment in a movie. But, watching the film, the cinematic choices felt more like promotion for a conservative Christian nationalist agenda. As a biblical scholar who has published widely on the representation of the New Testament on film , and on Christian antisemitism , I was looking forward to watching Mary. I felt hopeful that it would avoid many of the pitfalls of previous films . In its favour, the film draws on some underrepresented sources for Mary\u2019s birth, childhood and early life. Director D.J. Caruso has said that along with the canonical gospels and the ancient Jewish historian Josephus , he relied on a text called the Proto-Gospel of James for much of Mary\u2019s backstory. The trailer for Mary on Netflix. That text, composed in the 2nd century AD, contains an account of Mary\u2019s own immaculate conception and describes how her parents dedicated her to serve in the Jerusalem temple. While this account describes Mary living in the temple from the age of three and weaving the temple curtain , there is no clear evidence that anyone actually lived inside the temple \u2014 let alone, as the film depicts, a crowd of Handmaid\u2019s Tale-esque young women. My critiques of Mary centre around two themes. One is the way it perpetuates conservative ideals around women and gender. The other is its misrepresentations of Jews and Judaism. Patriarchal values Throughout the film, motherhood is venerated in ways that align with conservative values. In a TV interview with Christian Channel , Caruso said that he wanted to present Mary as a role model for young women today and to applaud her choice to accept God\u2019s annunciation of her pregnancy. However, neither Luke\u2019s gospel nor the film present Mary with a meaningful choice in this. The angel Gabriel\u2019s pronouncement cannot be resisted, as the biblical Mary recognises with her admission of being the slave of God , and therefore subject to his will. The trope of an unwed teenager (the film presents Mary as a teen, despite the Bible itself not giving her age) carrying an unexpected pregnancy to term, certainly aligns with right-wing Christian anti-choice rhetoric.

Sign up here . Depictions of Jewish people Mary also features problematic representations of Jewish people. Aside from the over-the-top hats worn by the temple priests, the film insists on Christian exceptionalism \u2013 that Jesus and his family were radically different from Jews of their time. Like many films about Jesus\u2019s life, Mary misrepresents Jews as focused on the wrong things. For example, only Mary, played by Noa Cohen, thinks to share the temple\u2019s wealth with the poor . And only Joseph (Ido Tako) comes to her defence against those Jewish characters who would uphold \u201cthe law\u201d. One especially problematic scene shows a pregnant Mary being chased through the streets by a Jewish mob yelling \u201c zonah \u201d (prostitute). At this and several other points, characters note how according to \u201cthe law\u201d Mary should be stoned to death. This idea of Jewish law as cruel and violent is an age-old stereotype . In reality, those applying the law often went to extreme lengths to avoid a death penalty . But what makes this scene worse is that the would-be murderers yell in Hebrew. The language is hardly used elsewhere in the film and so sets the crowd apart as distinctly Jewish. The murderous Jewish mob is a dangerous trope with a long history in Christian antisemitism. The mob foreshadows the Jewish crowd calling for Jesus\u2019s execution in front of Pilate and the antisemitic charge of deicide \u2013 killing God in the form of Jesus \u2013 against the Jews. Right-wing funding Joel Osteen , a mega-church pastor and televangelist renowned for promoting a prosperity gospel (the belief that financial blessings and physical wellbeing reflect the favour of God), is an executive producer of the film. Mary also claims input from faith leaders across a range of Christian denominations, as well as other religions. However, only one religious expert is listed on the film\u2019s credits. Adam W. Schindler is listed as the consultant \u201cbiblical scholar,\u201d but describes himself on his website as a pastor and digital strategy consultant. Schindler also holds a leadership position in the America First Policy Institute (AFPI). AFPI is a right-wing thinktank launched in 2021 by former Trump administrators in order to promote Trump\u2019s policies. Several AFPI members have now accepted leadership positions in president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet. It is this organisation, perhaps more than the infamous Project 2025 , that seems to be providing policy input for Trump. As part of this, AFPI has published an 80-page booklet outlining the ten biblical pillars to restore America to its so-called Judeo-Christian foundations. This includes opposing abortion and comparing abortion to infanticide, declaring unconditional support for the state of Israel, promoting conservative understandings of gender as a binary and repeating the tired myth about Christians being widely persecuted in America . It is no wonder, then, that Mary leans in to many of these conservative talking points. The story of a Palestinian mother who gave birth in a ruined building, on the run from murderous soldiers, could have been timely and important. Instead, Mary reinforces many dangerous stereotypes that have historically led to violence against Jews, while avoiding showing the holy family\u2019s embrace of Jewish practices . For Netflix to have so clearly missed the mark is disappointing. D.J. Caruso, Adam W. Schindler and Netflix did not respond to a request for comment. Meredith Warren does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.",

                    "content": "KATHLEEN EBELECHUKWU OKAFOR argues that democracy is the most viable mechanism for attaining development and egalitarianism According to Karl Marx and his prote\u0301ge\u0301 Freidrich, Engels, the history of the entire society is a history of class struggles. Struggles have arisen from patricians, knights, plebeians and slaves. As far back as ancient Rome, in the middle ages, the feudal lords, vassals, guild masters, journey men, apprentices, serfs and the bourgeoisie and proletariat also struggled for political space and economic domination. Originally, our country Nigeria had geographically extended powers to the Cameroons, Benin (Dahomey), Niger, up to Senegal with the main objective of extending British imperialism and procuring raw materials for British factories. The area was known as Royal Niger Company territory. Expectedly, where the British arrived in our shores, like in other colonized territories like India, Canada, Ghana, supremacist laws and practices were juxtaposed on most repugnant traditions and practices of the indigenes e.g. subjugation of women by men, disinheritance from family assets, etc. Our colonial masters did not submit to our native authorities perhaps, due to prevalent mass illiteracy uncodified/amorphous adjudicatory systems, language differences, etc. Usually, colonialists had created their own special courts applying English law and rejecting all native laws and customs as being \u201crepugnant to natural law, equity and good conscience\u201d. Courageous and erudite judges, championed disentanglement from the British legal order. That the democratic principles advocated by the British were alien or indeed repugnant to our indigenous sense of values, propriety and also authoritarian in nature. Neocolonialism and the Nigerian Legal System...Undoubtedly, many Nigerian laws, cultural practices and legal systems have been substantially progressively revised to accord with positive indigenous values like sanctity of marriage, humanitarianism, and communality. Yet our historical experience of forced labour, slavery, obedience to, obnoxious and draconian laws, gender exclusivity persist in our socio-political space. The democracy as imparted to us, was bereft of underlining thought foundation and aspiration of the people especially as espoused by the military. Illiterate seekers and traders with minimal education plunged into politics as an industry for self-sustenance without capacity to navigate complex micro- macroeconomics and rules of political engagement. From political parties\u2019 primaries, it is discerning that our borrowed democratic principles have not been effectively transmitted after independence. Having endured nearly four centuries of the slave trade from 1500, Benin Empire of 1440- 1487 and 100 years of British colonial imperialism, Nigerian politicians and the generality of Nigerians had not been properly initiated into the norms and practices of decorous democratic governance. Prior to this scheme, our people had obeyed the whims and caprices of feudal traditional rulers, unelected elders whose authority flowed from the barrel, after centuries of social and cultural manipulation, and prebendalism. Early practice of democracy in Nigeria was characterized by military regimes hijacking political power which held the country hostage for over three decades, 1966- 1999. Militarism had therefore stamped authoritarianism into our democracy. Thus, it is not surprising that the country\u2019s progress towards democracy was entrenched by undemocratic elements within Nigeria\u2019s political space. A government of laws and of men is overly optimistic for order to be founded on mere statute books, laws and due process and not ingrained in the people\u2019s consciousness. The foundation of fractious democracy has rather been laid on conflicting judicial orders, widespread disrespect for law and order, rising incidents of self-help parochialism and ineffective law enforcement agencies. Law being an instrument of social change, the inter-relationship between democracy and the legal system confirms that our democracy is a work in progress. We have had an opportunity to have civil rule in a full-fledged democratic society, to take full advantage of the government of the people, by the people and for the people. Both democracy and the rule of law are two sides of a coin to avoid fascism and blind adherence to the wiles of dictators, sit-tight politicians, and undemocratic forces. Inevitably, a way has to be found to convince Nigerian politicians that democrats are an integral part of the quest for an effective legal order. An autochthonous grundnorm needs to be recreated for the people\u2019s consent and rejuvenation of the national morale towards radical inventions, law compliance and participation in the humongous benefits of the 5th Industrial Revolution. However, we do know that universal ingredients of democracy include supremacy of the law, separation of powers, checks and balances, sanctity of the ballot-box, independent and strong Bar freedom of expression, due process of law, independence of the judiciary. This means that democracy also incorporates the elements of liberal democracy and neo-colonialism, more attuned to a homogeneous society. Currently, Nigeria\u2019s fractious democracy consistently attests that we merely have a civilian dispensation and not real democracy. This may be because of class struggles based on ethnicity, religion, gender, politicians and their people, shareholders and their employees, serfs and their feudal lords, capital and labour, etc. The Urgency of Democracy Lawyers: In conclusion, lawyers must be ready, willing and able to be at the vanguard of the struggle for a better society. We should always remember that Mahatma Gandhi, Barack Obama, Obafemi Awolowo, Nelson Mandela, Gani fawehinmi, Olisa Agbakoba, etc., were lawyers who stood on the barricades of the liberation struggle for their people. Our lawyers should therefore make a conscious choice to depart from self-seeking, self-serving and self-conceited motives in favor of the ideals that would ensure life more abundant for the preponderant majority of our people. Only thus can the profession attract greater understanding, relevance and empathy among compatriots as well as remain the truly learned profession that commands honor. In any case, and for now, democracy presents a most viable mechanism for attaining faster development and egalitarianism. This is more so because democracy is inevitably intertwined with a functioning legal order for a viable society. Prof. Okafor, SAN, FICArb, writes from Base University, Abuja, ke_okafor@yahoo.com",

                    "content": "By Choe Chong-dae As the maple leaves fell from the trees, I had the immense pleasure of attending a luncheon for the 38th graduating class of Gyeongju\u2019s Wolseong Elementary School. Six decades have passed since I last walked those halls, yet this was my first opportunity to reunite with former classmates \u2014 both men and women \u2014 in Seoul. Some friends even traveled from Gyeongju, the location of the school, to join us. The gathering had been set a month and a half in advance, and the anticipation was palpable, much like children eagerly awaiting a long-anticipated picnic day. I\u2019ve had the privilege of attending various alumni associations and prestigious gatherings, including international and diplomatic events. However, none of these could compare to the profound emotional impact of reuniting with my elementary school friends, recalling waves of nostalgia. Some faces were instantly recognizable, while others were more difficult to place \u2014 time, as it does, has reshaped us. These were no longer the playful children I once knew but graceful, vibrant individuals now in their early 1970s, still in the prime of their later years. Yet, despite the passage of time, the essence of our youthful camaraderie lingered, as if it had never truly left. What saddened me, however, was learning that Wolseong Elementary School is now at risk of closure. This is a direct result of Gyeongju\u2019s declining population and Korea\u2019s low birthrate. The news was especially poignant after we began reminiscing about our time there, making the possibility of this cherished institution disappearing all the more heartbreaking. Wolseong Elementary, named after Wolseong Fortress, the royal palace of the Silla Kingdom \u2014 is steeped in history and tradition. To think it might soon be lost feels like losing a part of our shared heritage. As we reintroduced ourselves and exchanged greetings, the conversation quickly turned to stories buried deep in our memories. Through laughter and nostalgia, we rediscovered the world of our childhood \u2014 an age of innocence, unburdened by the complexities of adulthood. Social status, wealth and gender seemed irrelevant as we connected once again as our younger selves \u2014 playful and mischievous children. For a brief moment, time\u2019s barriers dissolved, and we relived the carefree joy of our elementary school days. Although several hours had passed during the gathering, all the participants were still immersed in those fond memories, making it feel as though time had stood still. Relishing the closeness of our friendships, a female participant from Gyeongsan, near Daegu, suggested inviting everyone to a resort near Busan at the earliest opportunity. We decided to meet in early January, and the idea was met with unanimous enthusiasm. In a world that often values novelty, there is something profoundly sweet about reconnecting with old friends and revisiting the beautiful moments of our shared past. Wolseong Elementary was more than just a school \u2014 it was a place of natural beauty and inspiration. Nestled amid the grand, ancient tombs and flowing streams, the schoolyard came alive with wildflowers in the spring and fiery autumn leaves in the fall. These distinctive rural scenes are forever etched in my memory, a reflection of the nurturing love of our mothers \u2014 a love as boundless and enduring as the seasons themselves. We take great pride in the fact that the majority of our brothers and sisters graduated from Wolseong Elementary. As we parted ways after the reunion, I felt deeply grateful for the chance to reconnect and reminisce. The saying, \"Old friends are like gold,\" perfectly captures the enduring nature of friendships formed in youth. These bonds, strengthened by shared memories, stand the test of time, just as gold retains its luster. Reunions like this remind us that, despite life\u2019s changes, the friendships of our youth remain timeless, bridging gaps and grounding us in the beauty of our past.

                    "content": "Tuesday, December 10, 2024 Uttar Pradesh is developing a Heritage Tourism Policy focused on the adaptive reuse of historic forts, palaces, and mansions. A recent gathering in Lucknow allowed key stakeholders to collaborate on shaping the policy, which seeks to transform heritage sites into immersive tourism attractions. The initiative draws from the proven success of Rajasthan\u2019s heritage tourism approach. Uttar Pradesh is crafting a Heritage Tourism Policy designed to breathe new life into its historic forts, palaces, and mansions through adaptive reuse, with a focus on experiential tourism. Drawing inspiration from Rajasthan\u2019s successful model of integrating heritage properties into tourism, the policy aims to preserve history while fostering sustainable economic growth. On December 7, the Department of Tourism, in partnership with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), organized a Heritage Tourism Conclave in Lucknow. The event brought together more than 50 royal families, hospitality groups, investors, and consultants to discuss the draft policy and provide feedback before its final approval by the cabinet. At the conclave, Prateek Hira, Chairman of FICCI\u2019s UP Tourism Committee, underscored the increasing popularity of experiential travel, where tourists engage with the rich history of heritage properties. Hira pointed out that Rajasthan\u2019s strategy of adaptive reuse has not only safeguarded historic buildings but also contributed to long-term economic viability. Mukesh Kr. Meshram, Principal Secretary and Director General of Tourism, reassured stakeholders of the government\u2019s commitment to supporting the initiative through infrastructure upgrades, fiscal incentives, and improved visibility with better signage. He also shared that significant heritage properties under state archaeology have been leased to hotel chains, with several projects set to launch soon. Special Secretary for Tourism, Eesha Priya, introduced the draft policy, which includes subsidies designed to encourage participation. Meanwhile, Director of Tourism, Prakhar Misra, presented Uttar Pradesh\u2019s diverse heritage offerings and emphasized the potential for eco-tourism and adventure activities to enhance the visitor experience. The conclave concluded with an open feedback session led by Prateek Hira, allowing stakeholders to contribute valuable insights to help refine the policy. Uttar Pradesh aims to establish itself as a leading heritage tourism destination, preserving its historical assets while generating economic opportunities.",

                    "description": "The Dublin glass-and-steel house is Ireland\u2019s only private late-20th century home rated as of national importance. Tallon\u2019s vision is threatened by a new home",
                    "content": "Tallon House , off Torquay Road on Golf Lane, is not only listed on Du\u0301n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council\u2019s register of protected structures but also rated as being of national importance in the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage \u2013 the only private home in this country dating from the latter half of the 20th century with such status. Designed by Ronnie Tallon , the titanic figure of modernist architecture in Ireland, the serenely beautiful single-storey house stands on a wooded site adjoining Foxrock Golf Club, with views south towards the Dublin Mountains. The site had been a quarry and was completely overgrown when Tallon first spotted its potential in the mid-1960s. Having bought it for just \u00a32,000, he set about clearing the two-acre site, taking care to save worthwhile trees, and designed a home for himself, his wife, Nora, and their growing family, inspired by his architectural hero Ludwig Mies van der Rohe\u2019s Farnsworth House , near Plano, Illinois, 80km southwest of Chicago. Completed in 1951, that house was designed as a weekend retreat for Dr Edith Farnsworth, a busy Chicago physician, and \u201cappears as a structure of platonic perfection\u201d in a complementary landscape that was \u201can integral aspect of Mies van der Rohe\u2019s aesthetic conception\u201d, according to the US National Trust for Historic Preservation. The trust acquired Farnsworth House in 2003 from Lord (Peter) Palumbo, who had bought it in 1972 after being rendered \u201cabsolutely speechless\u201d by its beauty. I had the pleasure of visiting it in 1999 when the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland had its conference in Chicago, including a \u201cpilgrimage\u201d to the Mies masterpiece. As a build, it was ill-starred. Dr Farnsworth fell out with Mies after costs soared to $74,000 ($900,000 in today\u2019s money). Two years later the nearby Fox river burst its banks and flooded the house, even though it is raised on pilotis. It flooded again in 1997, requiring the replacement of expensive primavera-mahogany panelling for a second time. Tallon House is far superior and much more refined. Even when first built, more than 50 years ago, it was significantly larger than Farnsworth, with full-height sliding glazed panels recessed behind the steel frame, allowing for iroko decks on either side. A platform with broad open-riser steps announces its front entrance. The largely open-plan house was extended twice, first in 1996, to provide an en-suite bathroom and dressingroom at its eastern end, and again in 1998, to create a west-facing study. These additions gave the house its final elongated form. A gate lodge, containing a livingroom, kitchen, two bedrooms and a bathroom, was built in the 1980s. In 2005 Ronnie and Nora Tallon hosted lunch for the late Terence Riley , architecture and design curator at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, along with the architecture critic Shane O\u2019Toole and myself. Riley was bowled over by the house and its landscape, saying he felt its Miesian spirit much more powerfully than at Farnsworth. [ RIAI gold medal: \u2018Magical classrooms\u2019 at Dublin national school win Ireland\u2019s top prize for architecture Opens in new window ] In a rare honour for a private home, the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland awarded the ultramodern house its triennial housing medal for 1971-73. By then Tallon had already won two RIAI gold medals, one for RTE\u0301 Television Centre , in Montrose in Dublin, and the other for his less well-known GEC factory , in Dundalk, Co Louth, bagging both while still in his 30s. As I wrote in 2010, \u201cif Sea\u0301n Lemass and TK Whitaker invented modern Ireland, it was Ronnie Tallon, pre-eminently among his peers, who put shape on it, with a range of major buildings that have (mostly) stood the test of time\u201d. These include the former Bank of Ireland HQ on Lower Baggot Street, now fully renovated as Miesian Plaza . Occupied by the Department of Health, it is one of the relatively few modernist buildings on Dublin City Council\u2019s register of protected structures . Others added to the register more recently include Television Centre (1962) and four other buildings on RTE\u0301\u2019s Montrose campus, all of which Tallon was involved in designing. The building that pleased him most was the former Carrolls cigarette factory in Dundalk, later repurposed for educational use. This was where he was able to realise the \u201csimplicity and freedom of the module\u201d that so inspired him at the Katsura Imperial Villa in Kyoto, which he visited five times. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to Lourdes for a cure,\u201d he told me. Tallon was awarded the RIAI\u2019s first James Gandon medal for lifetime achievement in 2010, reflecting his stature as \u201cprobably Ireland\u2019s greatest architect since the 18th century\u201d, in the words of Paul Keogh, then president of the institute. Tallon died at home in June 2014, at the age of 87. His beloved wife, Nora, lived three years longer. The house and land at 4 Golf Lane were sold in 2022 for \u20ac2.8 million to the Foxrock businessman Derek O\u2019Leary and his wife, Linda, who also own Auburn Lodge, at 3 Golf Lane. Through their family company, Basl Developments, they sought planning permission last August for a flat-roofed, two-storey dwelling in the grounds of Tallon House. The proposed house, designed by the architect Paul Brazil , was to be located in the southeastern end of the grounds, adjoining a car port and garden studio and screened from Tallon House by new planting, with vehicular access through the existing gates and driveway. A red line around the new house\u2019s site indicated that it would be sold off. As planned, there was to be a separation distance of just 10 metres from the east gable of Tallon House, and three trees would have to be felled to accommodate the proposed house. But Brazil said it had been \u201csensitively sited and designed and is appropriate in terms of its proposed scale, mass, height and materials\u201d. Du\u0301n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council \u2019s conservation officer, Sine\u0301ad O\u2019Hara, disagreed. Describing Tallon House as \u201cone of the greatest Irish houses of the 20th century\u201d, she said the sylvan landscape associated with it \u2013 \u201can intrinsic part of the original design concept\u201d \u2013 would be adversely affected by the development. In its decision to refuse permission on October 3rd, the council\u2019s planning department said \u201cthe proposed two-storey dwelling by way of its height, design, form and scale would have an overbearing visual impact on the protected structure of Tallon House and would be detrimental to its unique character and setting\u201d. [ 10 of Ireland\u2019s best buildings, from prehistory to the 21st century Opens in new window ] When, in 2023, the owners of Ardenza and Glenarm on Torquay Road sought permission for a pair of five-bedroom detached houses in their rear gardens, abutting the southern boundary of Tallon House, Derek O\u2019Leary objected on the basis that this scheme would negatively affect the architectural significance of its designed landscape. An Bord Pleana\u0301la granted permission , saying the two houses proposed \u201cwould not adversely affect the character of protected structures in the vicinity of the site\u201d. Now Basl Developments is asking the board to overturn the council\u2019s decision to refuse permission for the proposed two-storey house within the curtilage of Tallon House. Brazil has submitted a revised scheme under which the car port and garden studio would be demolished and the new dwelling repositioned in their place, 15-18 metres further from Tallon House and screened by a yew hedge. Changes have been made to its design, and two trees are also being retained. He says it has been designed in a contemporary manner to relate to Tallon House, \u201cbut importantly will be clearly legible as a later addition\u201d, an approach that \u201caccords with best conservation practice\u201d. In this case, however, the central issue is that the new addition would intrude into a landscape that is crucial to the setting of Tallon House. In his submission to An Bord Pleana\u0301la, Shane O\u2019Toole draws its attention to a private-edition book, House + Garden (2103), in which Ronnie and Nora Tallon gave a vivid account of how they created their family home and fine-tuned its landscape, describing every single tree. This shows that the house and its curtilage \u201cform a consistently planned singularity\u201d. I have also made a lengthy submission. It was all I could do, along with writing this article, to honour the memory of a great Irish architect. An Bord Pleana\u0301la is due to make its decision by March 13th, 2025.",

                    "description": "The number of vacant units in this high street paints a bleak picture - but we spoke to those fighting to transform the town\u2019s fortunes.",
                    "content": "Photographs taken around Ramsgate town centre paint a bleak picture. Argos, closed. Wilko, closed. New Look, closed. Plus many more who have tried and failed to make it here. In fact, a staggering 65 units are empty - almost one in four, which is significantly higher than the national average of 14%. More than half of its vacant shops are not even advertised for sale or rent. Yet just a few miles along the coast, Ramsgate\u2019s Thanet neighbours Margate and Broadstairs are revelling in newfound reputations as trendy destinations. Folkestone and Deal are also riding a similar wave on the east Kent coast. So why has Ramsgate missed the boat? It has a history to at least match its rivals. King George IV was so enamoured with it that he declared it the country\u2019s first and only Royal Harbour. But as you walk through the present-day town centre, it hardly feels like the red carpet is being rolled out. The opening of the Westwood Cross 19 years ago had a significant impact, with many big retailers ditching the high street for the new out-of-town shopping centre. Plus the sheer size of Ramsgate town centre - built up from its previous holiday destination status, which has long since deserted it - means it is far more visibly hit than its neighbours. Margate's retail footprint is far smaller in comparison, as is Broadstairs\u2019. So those are the challenges - but what can be done about it? Louise Brooks launched the Ramsgate Empty Shops Action Group in October last year. Its aim is to help businesses, councils and anyone else who might be interested in saving the area work together. She told KentOnline: \u201cRamsgate\u2019s got really good bones - it just needs a little bit of support to drive it forward. \u201cIt's not about coming in and reinventing the wheel. It's about trying to pull together all those different strands of things that are already happening. \u201cOne of the things we do need to look at for Ramsgate is what our anchor attractions are. For Margate, it was the Turner Contemporary and Dreamland. Folkestone has the harbour arm and the Creative Quarter.\u201d Right now, she says, Ramsgate is going through a transition period. \u201cIt needs a little bit of life support while we establish some independents that are going to be sustainable because it's a tough time for businesses to start out,\u201d Mrs Brooks said. \u201cYou've had New Look, Argos, Wilko and the banks all go. You've just got these great big empty spaces in between these little independents that are trying to survive.\u201d It was only two years ago that Harbour Street was being celebrated as a booming location for new businesses. But charming independents such as Book Bodega later struggled, alongside national retailers. The reasons for this are fairly obvious \u2013 the cost-of-living crisis, the rise in the use of online services, the aftermath of the pandemic and general deprivation in the surrounding area. Neighbourhoods in and around the town centre are in the top 20% of the most deprived in the country, while crime is also a concern with Ramsgate previously branded \u201clawless\u201d . But it\u2019s not all bad news. The Royal Harbour remains popular thanks to its stunning beauty - as does the nearby Wetherspoon (the world\u2019s biggest), which benefited from a \u00a3750,000 refurb this year. Thanet District Council is set to inject a further \u00a319.8 million of Levelling Up funding into the area - a move that would reopen the port and offer training and opportunities to residents through a \u201cgreen campus\u201d . However, Mrs Brooks is not entirely sold on the premise of opening it back up as a trading port. \u201cI think it could serve a lot better as a tourist destination,\u201d said the mum-of-two. \u201cYou've seen it happen in lots of other ports around the world, where they've turned them into creative workspaces - you've got it to a smaller degree over in Whitstable.\u201d So the funding is coming for the port, but the empty shops in the high street remain a problem. Photographer Caitlin Neaves has been following the fortunes of all retail premises across Thanet for the past year, with her images in Ramsgate gaining attention on social media. Critics accuse her of intentionally making the town look bad. However, Miss Neaves stands by her decision to share pictures highlighting the issue. She hopes her work can be a platform to instigate discussion and change. \u201cIt's not very realistic to have all these pictures of these beautiful shop fronts and then all the dormant ones that everyone's ignoring just kind of slip to the back of people's minds,\u201d said Miss Neaves. \u201cThe reaction that I get is people saying \u2018why would you focus on something so negative when everything else is already pretty rough?\u2019. \u201cBut I think that focusing on it means that people talk about it and then it sparks change - and I would love to see the shops full.\u201d Miss Neaves argues the town needs more community hubs, where people can go to develop skills and social connections. \u201cI think that Ramsgate should be as up-and-coming as Margate but it feels a lot of the money isn't being poured back into Thanet equally,\u201d she said. \u201cWe get a lot coming over Broadstairs and Margate way, but coming towards Ramsgate we don't get a lot of investment or funding to open up places. \u201cIt has so much more potential than its counterparts \u2013 we're bigger, we have more space, there's more history. \u201cRamsgate still is a historic harbour and a lot of our heritage lies in it being a maritime place.\u201d Labour MP Polly Billington is also trying to get units reopened in Ramsgate. She backs plans to give councils powers to take control of long-term empty properties and dish them out to businesses on a leasehold basis. \u201cThere is so much energy and enthusiasm for the town centre and there has been some progress including the reinstatement of the market and the refurbishment of the Harbour Bar which has improved the look and feel of the high street,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to end the blight of boarded-up shops, so that we can get cash registers ringing again, more visitors pounding our pavements, and breathe a new lease of life into our struggling high streets.\u201d The MP says that for too long absent landlords had been allowed to sit on empty shops as they accrued value as property investments, without making a meaningful effort to market them for rent. While Ramsgate is not one of the areas which will pilot the government\u2019s High Street Rental Auction (HRSA) scheme, Ms Billington is pushing for it to be included in the near future. The HRSA process begins with a notice period of up to 12 weeks followed by an auction period of a similar timeframe. Premises are eligible when they have been left unoccupied continuously for 12 months, or 366 or more days on and off across a two-year period. Sites with redevelopment plans in place may not be included. Mrs Brooks also welcomes the idea, adding: \u201cIt's really hard to set up a business on the high street. These rental auctions could be a real game-changer if we've got the right support to implement. \u201cWe need people to be able to come in and test their business ideas in a low-risk environment so they can walk away and not be looking down the barrel at 20 grand or something in terms of losses.\u201d There has already been some movement in seeing new businesses take over sites \u2013 Ramsgate Community Centre in the former Cats in Crisis shop and Sugar Rush in the old WHSmith are two examples. The return of the Friday market after a four-year hiatus has also brought people back into the town centre. But, as Ramsgate\u2019s MP says, there is clearly still \u201cmuch more to do\u201d.",

                    "content": "Editor\u2019s Note: An earlier version of this article was first published in December 2023. Which fashion item is as beloved by members of the royal family as it is by JLo? Or as relevant on the runways of 2024 as in the knitting catalogs of 1960? The answer is surprisingly festive. The Fair Isle knit, a two-stranded knitting tradition originating off the coast of Scotland, has been a wardrobe staple for well over 100 years \u2014 keeping everyone from 18th century fisherman to Mick Jagger warm. In the last five years, luxury brands Ralph Lauren, Thom Browne, Chanel, Celine, Balenciaga, Raf Simons, Versace and Dries van Noten have all sent their renditions of the heritage knit down the catwalk. London-based designer Molly Goddard has even made the pattern something of an unofficial signature, making sure to pair a structured Fair Isle-style knit with a flouncy, tulle skirt in almost every collection. In short, it has become a winter classic that seems perpetually in vogue. Rom-com leading man, Adam Brody, recently wore a red and white version on the cover of Stylist magazine ; while Katie Holmes was snapped running errands in an old beige Fair Isle favorite from 2022. For those in the northern hemisphere, it\u2019s appropriate to shrug on as soon as the nights draw in right until sweater weather deteriorates. That being said, even in season-less Los Angeles, stars like Hailey Bieber have been seen in the cozy Fair Isle knits grabbing coffees. Taking its name from the island of Fair Isle \u2014 part of the Shetland archipelago about 100 miles off the northeastern coast of Scotland \u2014 the knitting technique first began in fisherman\u2019s hats during the 18th and 19th century (our beloved sweaters came much later). The two strand pattern was not only artistic, but made the tall, conical shaped caps extra warm by doubling the textile mass. They often featured a knitted interior lining, too. The typical Fair Isle knit follows an \u2018OXO\u2019 pattern, where a geometric \u2018O\u2019 is followed by an \u2018X\u2019 and repeated throughout the garment. Some knitters fill the \u2018O\u2019 shape with symbols such as crosses, snowflakes, or a central dot called a \u201cgoose\u2019s eye\u201d. But what set them apart from other fishing workwear was the vivid color palette. \u201cThey used blue, red, yellow, a natural white and a natural brown, called Shetland black,\u201d said Dr. Carol Christiansen, the curator and community museums officer at the Shetland Textile Museum \u2014 which has an expansive collection of pieces dating as far back as 1850. \u201cThe idea was that the skippers wore brighter colors so they were more easily seen, either from the land or by other boats.\u201d But how did functional workwear become one of fashion\u2019s most enduring designs? \u201cThey started to become a tourist item,\u201d said Dr. Christensen in a phone interview. In the 19th century, fishermen from Norway and the Netherlands came to the area to work and catch herring \u2014 a lucrative summer business \u2014 in Shetland\u2019s waters. The funny little colorful hats worn by the Fair Isle workers were seen as novel, charming and the perfect souvenir for the visiting Dutch fishermen to bring home. By 1870, Shetland had a regular boat and postal service, which boosted the scale of trade and tourism. It soon became a holiday destination for keen huntsmen or bird shooters who, just like the Dutch skippers, could take a piece of Fair Isle back with them. As demand grew, so did the trade. Suddenly the pattern was available in stockings, gloves, scarves and finally, pullovers. The look shot to popularity in the 1920s, when a portrait of the then-Prince Edward by Sir Henry Lander was painted in 1923 strengthened the design\u2019s association with sportsmanship. Rendered fresh off the golf course in a muted Fair Isle v-neck and tartan flat cap, the British royal helped catapult the style into the mainstream. It came just as women\u2019s styles were changing, too. Looser, more comfortable garments were eclipsing the restrictive nature of corsets and petticoats thanks to designers such as Paul Poiret and Gabrielle Chanel (the latter was a fan of Fair Isle herself, photographed in a collared cardigan with the distinctive \u2018OXO\u2019 pattern in 1910). Women were wearing similar cardigans, pullovers \u2014 often knitted by themselves, if couture was out of reach \u2014 and pleated knee-length skirts. Fair Isle quickly morphed into a symbol of family when in the 1940s and 50s it became a lynchpin of women\u2019s knitting pattern books. Mothers all over the UK would not only knit themselves a piece, but their husband and, using the leftover yarn, their children, too. Suddenly entire nuclear family units were dressed in matching Fair Isle \u2014 making it a visual shorthand for ideas of tradition, convention and wholesome living that modern designers still use to evoke nostalgia today. \u201cI think anything with a sense of place and time gives people a sense of belonging,\u201d said senior knitwear designer Emma Brooks for British label Toast in an interview via Zoom. Fair Isle knits are a consistent pillar of the brand\u2019s Fall-Winter collections, who have a partnership with a specialist factory in Scotland (though not in Shetland) and often work with local Scottish yarn spinners. \u201cThere\u2019s something about a knitted jumper and a motif around the yoke that is flattering. It\u2019s a pop of color without being too overwhelming, I think that taps into a lot of people\u2019s way of dressing.\u201d While the design has never been officially trademarked, there is a heritage quality to a traditional Fair Isle that is hard to replicate \u2014 though it is often attempted. In 2015, Chanel revived their affiliation with the pattern in a Metier d\u2019Arts collection in Rome (a collection dedicated to celebrating the craftwork of their ateliers). The knits ironically sparked controversy after independent Shetland label Mati Ventrillon claimed Chanel copied her designs after the fashion house visited her studio as research. Chanel apologized and credited Ventrillon in subsequent marketing language promoting the show. Brooks is keenly aware of the cultural sensitivity of the craft, and even visited Dr. Christiansen at the Shetland Textile Museum in 2019 to look for design inspiration for Toast\u2019s next collection, made with Shetland yarn. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be sensitive to the fact that certain motifs are very traditional from a particular regional area,\u201d said Brooks. \u201cWhat surprised me about the (Shetland Textile archive) was the breadth in terms of color palettes. I think because of what you see in historical books of Fair Isle, I was expecting more muted colors. But there was a real expanse, and a sense of designs changing over time and (knitters mixing) tradition with a completely different style.\u201d Today, Dr. Christiansen believes trademarking the craft of Fair Isle is almost impossible. \u201cThere have been attempts, but it\u2019s difficult since we never got as far as place designation,\u201d she said. There\u2019s also issues of cattle breeding, which means not all Fair Isle knits created on Shetland are made with wool from Shetland sheep. \u201cIt gets really complicated,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity because now it\u2019s probably too late. Fair Isle is being churned out all over the world.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s just how it is, it\u2019s global fashion.\u201d",

SINGAPORE \u2013 Raj Kumar and Kishin RK, the father and son duo behind one of Singapore\u2019s biggest property portfolios, are setting up a family office in Abu Dhabi, joining a growing list of rich people helping to cement the Middle East\u2019s status as a haven for the super wealthy. The entity will be called RB Family Office and will be located in Abu Dhabi Global Market, a free zone located on Al Maryah Island in the United Arab Emirates\u2019s capital, Mr Kishin said in an interview with Bloomberg News. \u201cWe chose Abu Dhabi because it\u2019s strategically located and has an internationally recognized legal framework,\u201d Mr Kishin said. \u201cA family office in Abu Dhabi is a way to establish our presence and allows us to expand our investments in the UAE and the Middle East.\u201d RB Family Office will be a first for the family, whose net worth has been estimated at around US$3.15 billion (S$4.22 billion). Mr Kishin declined to say how much money the family office will manage. He said the entity is in the process of hiring a team and the office will focus primarily on real estate investments in the retail, commercial and hospitality sectors. Mr Kishin runs RB Capital, a privately held real estate group that together with his father\u2019s Royal Holdings, oversees an estimated US$10 billion property portfolio that spans office towers, malls and hotels across Singapore. Marquee assets include The InterContinental Singapore, Robertson Quay and Cuppage Terrace Orchard Road, a heritage dining and co-working precinct near the city-state\u2019s main shopping thoroughfare. RB Family Office will be an \u201can extension of our portfolio in Singapore,\u201d Mr Kishin said. \u201cWe are still deeply rooted and committed to growing our portfolio in Singapore.\u201d Abu Dhabi has emerged as a go-to hub for the world\u2019s wealthy in recent years, attracting names like hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio and Leon Black, the co-founder of Apollo Global Management., both of which have set up family office branches in the emirate. Egyptian billionaire Nassef Sawiris has also said he plans to move his family\u2019s investment firm to Abu Dhabi Global Market while Russian steel magnate Vladimir Lisin and India\u2019s Adani family have offices registered there. Mr Kishin R.K., founder and chief executive of RB Capital and also the 11th richest man in Singapore, at the Forbes CEO Global Conference, on 30 Oct 2014. ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG Part of the attraction, outside of better access to the Middle East\u2019s already deep pool of money, is the comparative lack of red tape. Family offices in Abu Dhabi can be owned by a single family member (versus a minimum of two in Dubai) and established with registration fees as low as US$500. Singapore, by contrast, requires minimum investment amounts and greater disclosures as it steps up scrutiny of family offices following a huge money laundering scandal. Mr Kumar and Mr Kishin\u2019s move shows \u201cthe increasing global confidence in Abu Dhabi\u2019s position as a leading financial hub,\u201d Arvind Ramamurthy, Abu Dhabi Global Market\u2019s chief market development officer, said.

                    "description": "Nothing will beat Prince George greeting Obama in a bathrobe",
                    "content": "Over the years, the British royals have had plenty of encounters of the presidential kind \u2014 particularly Queen Elizabeth, whose record-breaking reign spanned 14 US Presidents . Joe Biden became the 13th sitting POTUS to meet the late Queen when he dropped in to Windsor Castle with first lady Dr Jill Biden for tea with the monarch following the 2021 G7 summit. Now, we're only weeks away from another president being sworn in \u2013 and, inevitably, more royal encounters.\ufeff From Prince George meeting Barack Obama in a fluffy robe, to Ronald Reagan hosting the Queen at his California ranch, here are some of the best photos from the royals meeting presidents over the years. Donald Trump isn't back in the White House just yet, but Prince William has already met with the president-elect. The Prince of Wales encountered Trump at \ufeffthe Embassy of the United Kingdom's Residence in Paris, France, on December 7. The duo discussed William's father King Charles' cancer ordeal, but it seems Trump was more focused on the man in front of him \u2013 namely, his \"handsome\" appearance. \"He's a good looking guy. He looked really, very handsome last night,\" Trump said after the meeting. \"Some people look better in person. He looked great. He looked really nice, and I told him that.\" OK then!\ufeff Keep reading as we go back into the archives of royals meeting presidents...\ufeff President Franklin D Roosevelt, his wife Eleanor and mother Sara are pictured here with King George VI and Queen Elizabeth during the royal couple's 1939 state visit to New York. The First Couple hosted the royals at their Hyde Park home. Harry Truman was the only US President Her Majesty met when she was still a princess. Princess Elizabeth briefly met Truman in Washington DC as part of her first royal visit to Canada in 1951. He was still president when she was coronated in 1952. A young Prince Charles and Princess Anne enjoyed a presidential encounter in 1959, when the Queen and Prince Philip hosted Dwight D. Eisenhower at their Scottish estate, Balmoral. The visit came two years after the president and first lady Mamie hosted Her Majesty during her first state visit to the US. Eisenhower was the first sitting president the Queen met during her reign. John F. and Jackie Kennedy had dinner with the Queen and Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace during a state visit, shortly after the president's inauguration in 1961. Though Kennedy later described it as a \"delightful\" occasion, the dinner has become somewhat infamous \u2014 in no small part thanks to The Crown , which suggested there was tension between the First Lady and Her Majesty . The Queen's sister Princess Margaret rubbed shoulders with President Lyndon Johnson during her first visit to the US in 1965. Margaret toured the US with husband Anthony Armstrong-Jones, the couple attending a state dinner at the White House hosted by Johnson and his wife 'Lady Bird'. The princess even enjoyed a spin on the dance floor with the president. This was Johnson's sole royal encounter during his term; he is the only president to have not met Queen Elizabeth while in office. President Nixon was invited to Buckingham Palace not long after he became president in 1969. President Nixon extended his hospitality to Her Majesty's two eldest children the following year. Prince Charles and Princess Anne enjoyed a brief visit to Washington DC in 1970 while touring Canada with their parents. There, they were treated to lunch on the presidential yacht and a dinner and dance at the White House. President Gerald Ford committed a rather comical faux pas while hosting the Queen for a state dinner at the White House in 1976, celebrating the US bicentennial. Ford escorted Her Majesty onto the dance floor just as the band struck up its next song... which happened to be 'The Lady is a Tramp'. Whoops. President Jimmy Carter is pictured here in conversation with the Queen Mother, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace. Her Majesty was said to share a particularly warm bond with President Ronald Reagan. In 1982, Reagan and his wife Nancy became the first presidential couple to stay at Windsor Castle, the president later saying horse riding with the Queen had been a highlight. The Reagans hosted the Queen and Prince Philip at their ranch in Santa Barbara, California a year after they stayed at Windsor Castle. Prince Charles and Princess Diana also enjoyed the Reagans' hospitality, with the presidential couple hosting the royals for a gala at the White House in 1985. Famously, Diana took a spin on the dance floor with John Travolta after Nancy Reagan prompted him, telling the actor it was the princess' \"wish\" to dance with him. During that same trip, the Prince and Princess of Wales also spent time with then-Vice-President George H W Bush, who would go on to become president four years later. In 1991, the Queen and Prince Philip visited the United States, where they were hosted by President George H W Bush. The president even took the royal couple to a baseball game in Baltimore. Following Bush's death in 2018, Her Majesty described him as \"a great friend and ally of the United Kingdom\". \"Prince Philip and I remember our days in Texas in 1991 with great fondness,\" she said in a statement. President Bill Clinton met Her Majesty on several occasions, and was a big fan of the monarch. \"She's a highly intelligent woman who knows a lot about the world... I always marvel when we meet at what a keen judge she is of human events,\" he once said. \"I think she's a very impressive person. I like her very much.\" In 2003, President George W Bush became the first US president to be granted a full state visit. To this day, only three presidents have been given the honour. George W Bush had met Her Majesty before he was elected, when she visited the US on a State Visit in 1991 during his father's time in office. The monarch attended a private lunch with the first family and, as he recalled to Robert Hardman , Bush decided to wear a pair of \"rather gaudy\" cowboy boots for the occasion in a nod to his Texan heritage. His mother, Barbara Bush, did not approve of the sartorial choice. \"You're not going to wear those boots, are you?\" she asked the future president, to which he replied, \"I'm sure Her Majesty would like them\" before showing the boots to the visiting Queen. \"Mother then said, 'Your Majesty, I just want you to know I'm going to move George as far away from you as possible during the luncheon!'\" he recalled. Evidently, the Queen was amused by the mother-son exchange. \"She looked at me and said, 'Are you the black sheep?' and I said, 'I guess you can say that, Your Majesty',\" Bush said. \"She loved that. She thought Mother was funny.\" Both Barack and Michelle Obama have both spoken fondly of their encounters with Her Majesty during their eight years as president and first lady. Barack once described her as one of his \"favourite people\", saying, \"She is an astonishing person and a real jewel to the world and not just to the United Kingdom.\"",

                    "content": "RAJ Kumar and Kishin RK, the father and son duo behind one of Singapore\u2019s biggest property portfolios, are setting up a family office in Abu Dhabi, joining a growing list of rich people helping to cement the Middle East\u2019s status as a haven for the super wealthy. The entity will be called RB Family Office and will be located in Abu Dhabi Global Market, a free zone located on Al Maryah Island in the United Arab Emirates\u2019s capital, Kishin said. \u201cWe chose Abu Dhabi because it\u2019s strategically located and has an internationally recognised legal framework,\u201d Kishin said. \u201cA family office in Abu Dhabi is a way to establish our presence and allows us to expand our investments in the UAE and the Middle East.\u201d RB Family Office will be a first for the family, whose net worth has been estimated at around US$3.2 billion. Kishin declined to say how much money the family office will manage. He said the entity is in the process of hiring a team and the office will focus primarily on real estate investments in the retail, commercial and hospitality sectors. Abu Dhabi has emerged as a go-to hub for the world\u2019s wealthy in recent years, attracting names such as hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio and Leon Black, the co-founder of Apollo Global Management, both of which have set up family office branches in the emirate. Egyptian billionaire Nassef Sawiris has also said he plans to move his family\u2019s investment firm to Abu Dhabi Global Market while Russian steel magnate Vladimir Lisin and India\u2019s Adani family have offices registered there. Part of the attraction, outside of better access to the Middle East\u2019s already deep pool of money, is the comparative lack of red tape. Family offices in Abu Dhabi can be owned by a single family member (versus a minimum of two in Dubai) and established with registration fees as low as US$500. Singapore, by contrast, requires minimum investment amounts and greater disclosures as it steps up scrutiny of family offices following a huge money laundering scandal. Kumar and Kishin\u2019s move shows \u201cthe increasing global confidence in Abu Dhabi\u2019s position as a leading financial hub\u201d, Arvind Ramamurthy, Abu Dhabi Global Market\u2019s chief market development officer, said. Kishin runs RB Capital, a privately held real estate group that together with his father\u2019s Royal Holdings, oversees an estimated US$10 billion property portfolio that spans office towers, malls and hotels across Singapore. Marquee assets include The InterContinental Singapore Robertson Quay and Cuppage Terrace Orchard Road, a heritage dining and co-working precinct near the city-state\u2019s main shopping thoroughfare. RB Family Office will be \u201can extension of our portfolio in Singapore\u201d, Kishin said. \u201cWe are still deeply rooted and committed to growing our portfolio in Singapore.\u201d BLOOMBERG",
