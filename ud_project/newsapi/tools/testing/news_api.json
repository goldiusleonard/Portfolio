        "content": "PETRONAS Chemicals Group Bhd ( (PECGF) ) has released its Q3 earnings. Here is a breakdown of the information PETRONAS Chemicals Group Bhd presented to its investors.\n\nPETRONAS Chemicals Group Berhad (PCG) is a key player in the petrochemical industry, specializing in the production and marketing of a wide range of chemical products, including olefins, derivatives, fertilizers, and methanol. The company is known for its integrated production facilities and strategic partnerships that enhance its market presence.\n\nIn its recent earnings report for the third quarter of 2024, PCG experienced a significant decline in profitability compared to the previous year. The company reported a net loss of RM 762 million for the quarter, a stark contrast to the profit of RM 439 million recorded in the same period of 2023. This downturn was primarily attributed to an unrealized foreign exchange loss and increased operational costs.\n\nPCG's revenue for the quarter increased by 18% to RM 7.986 billion, driven by higher sales volumes across its segments, notably in Olefins and Derivatives, and Fertilisers and Methanol. However, the company's operating profit was negatively impacted by a substantial foreign exchange loss, which overshadowed the gains from increased sales. Additionally, the company faced growing administration and distribution expenses, contributing to the overall financial strain.\n\nDespite these challenges, PCG's management remains cautiously optimistic about the future. The company anticipates stable product prices for fertilizers and methanol while expecting a gradual recovery in the specialties segment. The management is focused on maintaining operational excellence and optimizing its production facilities to navigate the current economic environment.\n\nLooking forward, PCG aims to leverage its strategic partnerships and continue its focus on operational efficiency to mitigate risks associated with foreign exchange fluctuations and market volatility. The company is also attentive to macroeconomic trends that may influence demand for its products and is poised to adapt its strategies accordingly."

        "content": "\"Nonetheless, this is a far cry from the 1.98 million bpd increase in 2023, which was fuelled by a return-to-normal following a COVID-19-induced plunge,\" noted Lafakis.\n\nHe highlighted that, over the past 20 years, demand has averaged around 1.2 million bpd, making the 924,000 bpd increase in 2024 a notable decline.\n\nThis reflects factors such as improved global energy efficiency, slower growth in China compared with the early 2000s, and the gradual electrification of the global vehicle fleet.\n\nThe average Brent price in 2024 is estimated at US$80.39 per barrel, down from US$82.19 in 2023.\n\nDespite turmoil in the Middle East, oil prices have remained stable, underscoring the industry's resilience.\n\n2024: A Year of Energy Transition and Technological Innovation\n\nIn 2024, the oil and gas sector is navigating a transformative era, driven by energy transition and technological innovation.\n\nAs the world pivots towards sustainability, industry giants are spearheading the integration of low-carbon technologies and digital transformation to sharpen operational efficiency and thrive in a market continuously reshaped by geopolitical shifts and regulatory flux.\n\nHefty investments drive a vigorous push towards energy efficiency, carbon capture, and renewables to meet ambitious global decarbonisation targets. This dynamic repositioning reflects the industry's adaptability and commitment to securing a greener, more sustainable future.\n\nSPI Asset Management managing partner Stephen Innes said a key trend in the oil and gas industry is the strong demand from emerging markets, notably in Asia, coupled with the escalating adoption of AI and generative AI technologies.\n\n\"These advancements are revolutionising the sector, enhancing operational efficiency and slashing costs significantly. Despite geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions, companies are maintaining continuity through strategic adjustments and technological innovation, ensuring they stay resilient and competitive in a fluctuating global market,\" he told Bernama.\n\nDomestically, Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) has intensified its innovation initiatives. Through its Petronas-Academia Collaboration Dialogue (PACD) programme, it has committed RM71 million to fund 61 researchers across 25 universities, including Monash University Malaysia.\n\nSeven projects have been selected, focusing on reducing CO2 emissions, producing green hydrogen, and enhancing energy system efficiency, aiming to develop sustainable solutions for global energy needs.\n\nThe domestic upstream sector is showing increased activity towards the year-end.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, contracts from Petronas and its production-sharing contract partners have surged, mainly for maintenance, construction, modification, and hook-up commissioning services. These have benefitted local players such as T7 Global Bhd, Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd, Carimin Petroleum Bhd, and Deleum Bhd.\n\nMiri-based Dayang Enterprise secured four contracts: Package B4 from Sarawak Shell Bhd/Sabah Shell Petroleum Co, Package A3 from Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd and SKA Oil, and Package A5 SBA Southern from Petronas Carigali.\n\nCarimin Petroleum obtained two contracts: Package B9 from Kebabangan Petroleum Operating Company Sdn Bhd in partnership with Evolusi Bersatu Sdn Bhd, and Package B5 from Sarawak Shell/Sabah Shell Petroleum Co.\n\nDeleum was awarded two contracts for Package A1 and Package A4 by Petronas Carigali, while T7 Global Bhd received contracts from ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Malaysia Inc (Package B2 - Guntong) and IPC Malaysia BV (Package B3). Uzma Bhd was also appointed as a panel contractor for integrated well continuity services by Petronas.\n\nAt the time of writing, discussions between Petronas and Sarawak's state-owned oil and gas company, Petroleum Sarawak Bhd (Petros), over the distribution of natural gas in Borneo are still ongoing, despite an initial expectation to conclude by Oct 1 -- a deadline set in July.\n\nCalm and rational discussions are essential in the ongoing negotiations over Sarawak's demand to assume the gas aggregator role.\n\nAnalysts have warned that Petronas's bottom line could be adversely affected if it cedes control to Petros, particularly the RM20 billion in annual profits generated from gas production in Sarawak.\n\nThis could lead to reduced capital expenditures, particularly in the gas sector and upstream operations.\n\nAs of the third quarter of 2024, Petronas, through its production sharing contracts (PSCs), has invested over RM17 billion in Sarawak's upstream oil and gas sector, including RM11 billion allocated for capital expenditure on new projects.\n\nThese projects include hydrocarbon production at the Jerun and Kasawari fields, as well as developments at the DEWA complex cluster and Ketapu cluster.\n\nGlobal oil markets are expected to finish the year balanced and enter 2025 with a surplus of more than 1.5 million bpd.\n\nLafakis said the surplus could widen if OPEC boosts output before Iranian exports decline, while US output growth slows, though any increase in production would exacerbate oversupply.\n\nOn the demand front, Moody's Analytics projects growth of slightly less than 1.0 million bpd in 2024 -- a sizeable downshift from last year's 2.1 million bpd growth, which was driven by COVID-19 recovery.\n\nLafakis said macroeconomic prospects for 2025 appear stagnant. China's weak economy is expected to persist, with non-OECD nations, led by India, poised to become the primary drivers of oil demand."

A sua parceria levou a equipa a alturas sem precedentes, garantindo oito campeonatos de construtores consecutivos e solidificando o lugar de Hamilton entre os maiores de todos os tempos no desporto.\n\nÀ medida que Hamilton inicia um novo capítulo com a Ferrari em 2025, a sua despedida na Malásia sublinha o profundo impacto do seu tempo na Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS -- um legado construído sobre colaboração, inovação e sucesso sem igual."

I always love coming here. I always get a fantastic welcome from everyone here in Malaysia and KL.\n\n\"I am excited to see the Petronas team, who have been like my family for the past 12 years, so I hope it is not the last time I get to come back, but I am looking forward to seeing everyone today.\"\n\nWith Hamilton fulfilling his contractual commitments at Mercedes, he is missing out on taking part in the end-of-season test in Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe likes of Carlos Sainz, Nico Hulkenberg, and Esteban Ocon are all in action for their new teams - but Hamilton isn't.\n\nDue to his contract situation and the aforementioned farewell tour, Hamilton won't be able to drive a Ferrari F1 car for the first time until early next year.\n\nThe good news for Ferrari is that they have their own track at Fiorano, which should allow Hamilton to acclimate to his new team.\n\nAs per F1's regulations, Hamilton will be allowed to drive the 2022 Ferrari car at some point ahead of pre-season testing in Bahrain."
