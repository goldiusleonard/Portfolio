                    "description": "The allegation comes a day after Opposition leader Peter Dutton criticised the government for being \"weak\" in acting against antisemitism.",
                    "content": "Labor MP Josh Burns has accused Opposition leader Peter Dutton of intervening during a press conference to prevent Liberal senator James Paterson from reading a statement in response to the attack on a Melbourne synagogue . At the time, Burns had lost his voice and was at a joint press conference with Paterson at the Adass Israel Synagogue as a show of unity, following the arson attack on 6 December, which the Australian Federal Police (AFP) have since classified as a terrorist incident . Speaking on ABC Radio National (RN) Breakfast on Tuesday, Burns said Paterson had agreed to read the statement on his behalf due to his inability to speak but alleged Dutton intervened to stop him from doing so. Source: AAP / Joel Carrett \"Unfortunately, right before we got on, Peter Dutton intervened and told James he wasn't allowed to read the statement,\" Burns told RN. \"I wanted to stand out with James and present a united front on this, and Peter Dutton decided it was more important to play partisan games than to allow my words, which I physically couldn't speak, to be read out.\" His statement was instead read by Daniel Aghion, president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ). Burns praised the leadership of the synagogue for being \"heroic and stoic\" in the wake of the attack and said he wasn't interested in \"the partisan games or personal attacks\". AFP establishes antisemitism taskforce after Melbourne synagogue attack Speaking to RN later on Tuesday morning, Paterson responded to Burns' comments, saying he felt \"very sorry that Josh Burns and his community have been abandoned by the Labor Party in the wake of this terrorist attack\". \"But it is not the role of a Liberal frontbencher to act as a spokesman for a Labor MP. One of the many senior Albanese government ministers from Victoria should have been there to speak if Josh was not able to,\" Paterson said. Dutton calls Albanese's antisemitism response 'weak' On Monday, Dutton criticised Labor and Burns for failing to speak up against antisemitism, saying Burns hadn't \"stood up to a weak prime minister\". \"The job for a Labor MP is to stand up to a prime minister who has put the political interests of the Labor Party ahead of our national security interests,\" he said. The Jewish community previously expressed frustration over a perceived lack of action by authorities to stamp out antisemitism, with the ECAJ arguing Australia was at a \"point of crisis\" in a letter sent to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Sunday. Albanese says he personally believes Melbourne synagogue attack was an act of terrorism \"Many in our community now question their future in this country,\" it wrote. \"We ask you, prime minister, to reflect on how this has been allowed to occur.\" Former Liberal treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who is a member of Melbourne's Jewish community, said: \"The government's weakness (in calling out antisemitism) has emboldened those who hate and emboldened those who harm.\" On Sunday, Albanese defended his government's support of the Jewish community, including announcing $32.5 million for community security, banning Nazi salutes and hate symbols, appointing the nation's inaugural antisemitism commissioner and criminalising doxing. 'Jewish people under siege': What we know so far about the 'shocking' synagogue blaze \"This is a time where the country should be looking for national unity, not looking for areas of distinction and difference over every issue,\" Albanese said. \"I would have thought that every Australian would be horrified by what occurred last Friday and would be equally prepared to condemn it and oppose it. It's un-Australian, I've said that. It's designed to create fear in the community, and it should be opposed.\" Writing on social media platform X on Monday, Burns responded to Dutton's comments, saying antisemitism is \"not a political issue for me. It is a lived reality\". \"My priority right now is on supporting our community in the aftermath of a disgraceful antisemitic terror attack.\" Federal antisemitism taskforce On Monday, Albanese called for national unity as he unveiled Special Operation Avalite, led by specialists from the AFP and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. Officers will be given expanded powers to investigate incidents like the arson at the Adass Israel Synagogue, and officers and analysts will be deployed nationally to investigate instances of urging violence against members of groups, advocating terrorism or genocide and using communications services to menace, threaten or harass. 09/12/2024 01:06 Play AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw said: \"Unfortunately, in Australia today, those of Jewish ethnicity or religion are being targeted because of who they are.\" \"This is a crime. This needs to stop.\" \u2014 With additional reporting from the Australian Associated Press",

                    "content": "CPI(M), from its official handle on X, wrote, \"His speech is akin to hate speech. Justice Shekhar Yadav, a sitting judge of the Allahabad High Court, addressed a VHP meeting. That he should do so is bad enough. That he should promote majoritarian views and communal hatred is unacceptable. Supreme Court should take suo moto notice and sack him!\" On 8th December, the sitting judge of the Allahabad High Court, Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav, attended and spoke at an event organised by the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) legal cell in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh. In his address at the event, he emphasised the cultural and constitutional significance of Bhagwan Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, the urgency of implementing a Uniform Civil Code (UCC), and the role of the majority in shaping the future of India. In his speech, Justice Yadav covered a wide range of topics, from societal reforms to national unity. Justice Yadav began his address by paying tribute to the sacrifices made by countless individuals for the construction of Bhavya Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh. He said, \u201cDid you imagine seeing the Ram Mandir with your own eyes? Many of our ancestors made sacrifices in the hope of seeing Ram Lalla freed and witnessing the construction of a grand temple. They couldn\u2019t see it but did their part, but now, we are witnessing it (the temple).\u201d He expressed optimism about the implementation of the UCC and assured the audience that the day is not far when UCC will become a reality. He said, \u201cI assure you, you will see this (UCC) bill very soon. The day is not far when it will be clear that if there is one country, there should be one law, and one penal law. Those who try to deceive or run their own agendas will not last long.\u201d Justice Yadav took an oath in the historic library hall of the Allahabad High Court and declared, \u201cThis country will definitely bring a uniform law, and it will bring it very soon.\u201d Referring to the 1985 Shah Bano case in the Supreme Court of India that upheld the right to maintenance irrespective of religion, he called the case a stepping stone for the implementation of the UCC. Justice Yadav remarked on the principle that the interests of the majority are central to governance in a democracy like India. He said, \u201cI have no hesitation in saying that this is Hindustan; this country would function as per the wishes of the bahusankhyak (majority) living in Hindustan. This is the law. The law, in fact, works according to the majority. Look at it in the context of family or society... Only what benefits the welfare and happiness of the majority will be accepted.\u201d He further stressed that such principles ensure the harmony and welfare of society at large. Moving further in his address, Justice Yadav criticised the discriminatory practices that affect women in certain communities and called them unconstitutional. He said, \u201cIf you say that our personal law allows this, it will not be accepted. A woman will receive maintenance, bigamy will not be allowed, and a man will have only one wife, not four wives... If one sister receives maintenance and the other does not, then that creates discrimination, which is against the Constitution.\u201d Justice Yadav strongly condemned practices like Halala and Triple Talaq and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t disrespect a woman who has been recognised as a goddess in our Shastras and Vedas. You can\u2019t claim the right to have four wives, perform Halala, or practise Triple Talaq. This right will not work.\u201d In relation to such practices, he emphasised that UCC is not only supported by organisations like RSS and VHP but that the Supreme Court of India has also advocated for it, suggesting it is a constitutional necessity. In his address, Justice Yadav elaborated on the broad definition of being Hindu. He said, \u201cA person who takes a dip in the Ganga or applies chandan is not the only definition of being Hindu. Anyone who considers this land their mother and is willing to lay down their life for the country in times of crisis, regardless of their religious practices or beliefs, whether they follow the Quran or the Bible, is a Hindu.\u201d He further underlined the importance of respecting the culture, heritage, and great personalities of India. He said, \u201cIt is not expected for Muslims to follow our culture, but it is definitely expected that they do not disrespect the culture of this country, the great personalities, and the God of this land.\u201d Justice Yadav issued a stern warning against certain elements within society that are disruptive. He referred to such elements as \u201cKathmulla\u201d, a term usually used for Muslims, who hinder national progress. He said, \u201cThe word may be inappropriate, but there is no hesitation in saying it because they (\u2018Kathmulla\u2019) are harmful to the country. They are people who incite the public, and they are the ones who prevent the country from progressing.\u201d He further issued a warning that if Indians fail to uphold their cultural values, \u201cIt won\u2019t take long for this country to become like Bangladesh or the Taliban.\u201d He also drew comparisons between how children are raised across communities. He pointed out that values of compassion and non-violence are deep-rooted in Hindu traditions. He questioned, \u201cIn our country, we are taught not to harm even the smallest animals, not to kill ants, and this lesson is ingrained in us. Perhaps that is why we are tolerant and compassionate; we feel pain when others suffer. But you do not have this. Why? In your culture, from a young age, children are exposed to the slaughter of animals. How can you expect them to be tolerant and compassionate?\u201d While concluding his address, Justice Yadav urged the people of India to recognise the significance of their cultural identity and values. He said, \u201cI won\u2019t say \u2018ek rahenge to safe rahenge,\u2019 but would say that once these values are realised, no one can harm us.\u201d Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav\u2019s address at the VHP\u2019s event has drawn sharp reactions from the left-liberal cabal. They have accused the sitting judge of the Allahabad High Court of making controversial statements favouring one community over others. His support for the UCC, critique of Islamic practices like Triple Talaq and Halala, and emphasis on the role of the majority in shaping the country triggered outrage to the extent that some demanded action against him by the apex court. CPI(M), from its official handle on X, wrote, \u201cHis speech is akin to hate speech. Justice Shekhar Yadav, a sitting judge of the Allahabad High Court, addressed a VHP meeting. That he should do so is bad enough. That he should promote majoritarian views and communal hatred is unacceptable.

It is associated with RSS, an organisation that Vallabhai Patel banned for being a \u2018force of hate and violence.\u2019 It is unfortunate that a High Court judge attended the conference of such an organisation. This \u201cspeech\u201d can be easily rebutted, but it\u2019s more important to remind his honour that the Constitution of India expects judicial independence & impartiality. May I direct his attention to AoR Association vs Union of India \u201cImpartiality, independence, fairness and reasonableness in decision-making are the hallmarks of the judiciary.\u201d The Constitution of India is not majoritarian but a democratic one. In a democracy, the minority\u2019s rights are protected. As Ambedkar put it \u201c...as a King has no Divine Right to rule, so also a majority has no Divine Right to rule.\u201d This speech indicts the collegium system and raises questions on judicial impartiality. How can a minority party expect justice before someone who participates in VHP\u2019s programs?\u201d, Owaisi wrote. The VHP was banned on various occasions. It is associated with RSS, an organisation that Vallabhai Patel banned for being a \u2018force of hate and violence.\u2019 It is unfortunate that a High Court judge attended the conference of such an organisation. This \u201cspeech\u201d can be easily... https://t.co/IMce7aYbcf Just a couple of days before Justice Shekhar Yadav\u2019s address, Owaisi was reposting speech excerpts of former Justice Rohinton Nariman. The left-liberals condemned Justice Yadav\u2019s remarks and labelled them divisive. They argued that his statements were inappropriate for a sitting judge and reignited debates on judicial propriety and ideological bias among members of the judiciary. Interestingly, the same left-liberal cabal crying foul over Justice Yadav\u2019s remarks lauded former Supreme Court judge Rohinton Nariman for his sharp critique of the 2019 Ayodhya verdict, delivered just days before the VHP event. Justice Nariman, during a lecture for the Ahmadi Foundation on 6th December, two days before Justice Yadav\u2019s address, called the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on Ram Janmabhoomi a \u201cmockery of justice\u201d and accused the five-judge bench of violating \u201csecularism, which, according to him, is a basic feature of the Constitution.\u201d Justice Nariman went further, describing the VHP-led karseva movement as \u201cdictatorial\u201d and the demand for the Ram Mandir as \u201ctyrannical.\u201d He claimed that the Places of Worship Act was disregarded in the Ayodhya judgment and criticised notices being served to mosques and dargahs, terming them \u201chydra heads\u201d that could incite communal discord. He argued that the strict enforcement of the 1991 law, which prevents Hindus from pursuing historical claims, is the only way to ensure communal harmony. Despite his harsh criticism of Hindus, Justice Nariman was widely celebrated by the left-liberal ecosystem. This stark contrast in the reception of similar issues, depending on the speaker and their stance, highlights the ideological bias prevalent among left-liberal circles. Justice Yadav\u2019s call for cultural respect and constitutional uniformity was branded divisive, whereas Justice Nariman\u2019s pointed remarks, which dismissed centuries of injustice faced by Hindus, were applauded as progressive. The selective outrage undoubtedly raises questions about the deep-rooted ideological bias among left-liberals. Justice Nariman\u2019s statement that \u201csecularism would only have been upheld if Hindus had abandoned their claim\u201d underscores the one-sided expectations placed on the Hindu community. His criticism of notices to mosques and dargahs, without acknowledging the historical destruction of Hindu temples, further reveals the hypocrisy of those claiming to champion secular values. Former Justice Nariman also expressed disappointment over the failure to rebuild a mosque on the disputed site after the demolition of the Babri structure, calling it a \u201ctravesty of justice.\u201d However, he overlooked the fact that Hindus adhered to the legal process for decades, seeking rightful ownership of their place of worship. Had the Hindu community acted outside the law, the disputed structure known as the \u201cBabri Masjid\u201d would not have stood until 1992, nor would the Ram Mandir have been planned nearly three decades later, only after the court ruled in favour of the Hindu community. There are certain elements of irony about the whole secularism sermon by Nariman. Former Justice Rohinton Nariman\u2019s father, the late Fali S Nariman, once criticised Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath becoming the head of the state because he is a Hindu priest. He claimed that CM Yogi\u2019s appointment was a threat to secularism. However, he completely ignored the fact that his son, Justice Rohinton Nariman, is himself a Parsi priest. Rohinton was ordained at the age of 12 and performed religious ceremonies. He has credited his priesthood for shaping his life and career. The starkly different receptions to Justice Yadav and Justice Nariman\u2019s statements expose a deep-seated bias within sections of the left-liberal ecosystem. While one judge is vilified for his calls to respect the Constitution and cultural heritage, another is glorified despite undermining the historical and legal struggles of a community. This selective appreciation serves as a glaring example of the hypocrisy that continues to plague public discourse on India\u2019s socio-religious landscape.",

                    "content": "A special taskforce is investigating antisemitism in Australia after , as Australia\u2019s intelligence chief warns of \u201cugly dynamics\u201d and politically motivated violence related to conflicts in the Middle East. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio) director general, Mike Burgess, urged all Australians to \u201cwatch our words\u201d, raising concerns about rhetoric leading to inflamed tensions. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said Friday\u2019s fire at the Adass Israel called for a \u201ctime for national unity\u201d, in a veiled swipe at the Coalition\u2019s escalating criticism of the government after Peter Dutton levelled . Dutton earlier claimed Burns \u2013 who is Jewish \u2013 \u201chasn\u2019t stood up to a weak prime minister\u201d. Burns, who brushed off the comments, has been a constant presence in the media in calling out antisemitism, and given numerous statements and speeches about anti-Jewish sentiment, including standing alongside the shadow home affairs minister, James Paterson, at the Ripponlea synagogue just hours after the arson attack. \u201cIt\u2019s not a time for some political leaders and some political parties to be looking for difference,\u201d Dreyfus said. The Australian federal police (AFP) and Asio chiefs joined the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, at a Canberra press conference on Monday afternoon to announce special operation Avalite, which will focus on antisemitism against community members and elected officials. Officials pointed to three separate arson attacks: the synagogue incident, being investigated as a likely terror act by Victorian police, as well as the torching of cars in , and . \u201cUnfortunately, in Australia today, those of Jewish ethnicity or religion are being targeted because of who they are ... This needs to stop,\u201d AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw said. \u201cSpecial operation Avalite will be an agile and experienced squad of counter-terrorism investigators who will focus on threats, violence, and hatred towards the Australian Jewish community and parliamentarians. In essence, they will be a flying squad to deploy nationally to incidents.\u201d Kershaw said the taskforce would also focus on the use of carriage services to threaten, menace or harass Jewish Australians. \u201cFrom today, the AFP will take a greater role,\u201d he said. Burgess said Asio would assist in operation Avalite, as well as conducting broader investigations on potential future terror threats. He said officials had no intelligence to suggest any ongoing threat related to the synagogue arson attack, and . \u201cSadly, this appalling incident appears to embody the ugly dynamics that Asio has been warning about. Politically motivated violence is now one of Asio\u2019s and this country\u2019s principal security concerns,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cAustralia\u2019s security environment is volatile and unpredictable. Anti-authority beliefs continue to grow. Grievances are spreading. Provocative and inflammatory language are being normalised ... Inflamed language leads to inflamed tension, and that can lead to violence. We all need to watch our words.\u201d Albanese on Monday said his government had \u201cconsistently taken action\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to do so,\u201d he said. He highlighted the government\u2019s ban on the Nazi salute and other hate symbols, the appointment of Jillian Segal as Australia\u2019s first special envoy on antisemitism, its anti-doxing legislation, the millions committed to security at Jewish community sites, its support of Israel\u2019s right to defend itself in the context of the Middle East war, and its call for a halt to . Paterson on Monday also , claiming that the government should have directed federal police to target anti-Jewish hatred more strongly. Asked if the government could have done more to stop such attacks, Burgess said: \u201cI think it\u2019s a hard call to put something on government to stop people doing the wrong thing.\u201d During the Monday afternoon press conference, Dutton met with community leaders. The opposition leader called the arson attack \u201ca shocking circumstance for every Australian\u201d. \u201cWhen you look at the devastation that\u2019s been wreaked upon a place of worship, it has no place in our country whatsoever,\u201d he said. \u201cThis really is evil. And we need to make sure that the antisemitism that has now become commonplace in our society is repelled at every opportunity.\u201d Albanese said he would visit the synagogue this week. He defended his response to the attack, noting he had spent the day in national security and cabinet meetings, and received daily AFP briefings. News Corp had published photos of Albanese playing tennis at Cottesloe beach on Saturday afternoon, as he spent three days on a Western Australian visit he said was long-planned. Asked about the timing, Albanese insisted the tennis games were a reasonable exercise break after a day of appointments. \u201cThat\u2019s what people do. On Saturday morning, I was in a synagogue ... I attended the barmitzvah of a young boy there and I was very much welcomed there,\u201d he said.",

                    "content": "If you\u2019re a mayor or councillor, you better be careful the next time some advocacy group comes to you demanding that you raise their flag or make a proclamation in their honour. A local Palestinian group wants you to raise the Palestinian flag on Nov. 29, the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, despite your view that Palestine is not actually a country? Better shut up and ready your flagpole or you might owe them money. A local Scientology group wants you to proclaim March 13 as the wise L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s birthday, despite your view that it\u2019s a cult? Better sign that proclamation or you could be dinged for creed discrimination. These are some of the troubling implications of the decision made by the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal against Mayor Harold McQuaker and his fellow Emo Township councillors. The human rights tribunal claims the council discriminated against a local activist organization when three out of five voted against proclaiming June as Pride month in the tiny northwestern Ontario community. Borderland Pride was awarded $10,000 from the township\u2019s taxpayers and another $5,000 from the mayor voting against the proclamation. The vote was found to be discriminatory because McQuaker allegedly made a homophobic remark when debating a separate request to raise the Pride flag. McQuaker was also ordered to do a training a human rights 101 course. So far, he\u2019s said he won\u2019t comply. The tribunal\u2019s decision is indefensible, and it builds on similarly indefensible decisions that found public officials discriminated by not proclaiming Pride or raising Pride flags. If the decision is not overturned on judicial review, Ontario should consider changing their Human Rights Code to prevent these kinds of blatant attacks on freedom of expression. The Emo decision is premised on the idea that proclamations and flag raisings are a \u201c service \u201d under the Code. Services must be provided equally to all people regardless of their race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, marital status, family status or disability. Finding that flag-raisings and proclamations are a \u201cservice\u201d represents a flawed understanding of what proclamations and flag-raisings actually are. Proclamations and flag raisings are political expressions. The whole point is for the mayor or council to choose whether to endorse what the proclamation says or what the flag represents. If it were otherwise, they would be empty gestures. The Emo decision requires compelled speech by mayors and council members against their consciences. It therefore violates their Charter rights . Even if the decision hadn\u2019t violated their freedom of expression rights, it should be overturned because the factual findings are irrational. The adjudicator found that a remark McQuaker made while discussing the proclamation and the Pride flag proved that the council\u2019s 3-2 vote against the proclamation was discriminatory, even though no one else was found to have said anything discriminatory and two other members also voted against it. In any event, it\u2019s absurd to find that McQuaker\u2019s remark, that there was no flag for the \u201cother side of the coin ... for straight people,\u201d was discriminatory. McQuaker was making the argument that, to foster equality, all people need to be treated equally. I\u2019m a gay man, and I happen to agree with that, as do many of my gay friends. The only flags that I think municipal governments should be flying on flagpoles is their own, their province\u2019s, or the maple leaf. Would I be discriminating against myself if I voted with McQuaker? The low quality of the expert evidence is another glaring problem. The adjudicator rested her finding that McQuaker\u2019s comment and vote against the proclamation harmed the LGBTQ people on testimony from a professor who pointed to \u201clongitudinal qualitative research with more than 1,200 people in the United States [who] described how the anti-LGBTQ rhetoric by President Trump, Vice President Pence, and members of Trump\u2019s cabinet during his presidency visibly increased the amount of hate and violence publicly expressed by others who were strongly affiliated with Trump\u2019s political views.\u201d That doesn\u2019t sound like particularly reliable research. Mayors and councillors must be free to make any proclamations and endorse any flag-raising they like \u2014 and reject those with which they disagree. If people don\u2019t like a decision their mayor councillors make, they can express themselves by voting for a different mayor and council in the next election.

                    "content": "Multiple drag and burlesque performers dropped out of Feast Festival after they experienced homophobic and transphobic threats from the community. South Australia \u2018s iconic premier LGBTQIA+ arts and cultural event, Feast Festival is held annually in November, and recently celebrated its 27th anniversary. Over two weekends, the event platforms queer stories through performance, film, workshops, and other community events. Cabaret Capers , organised by performer and producer Karney Doll , was set to take place in Peterborough , a regional South Australian town in the Mid North. It was hit with unexpected challenges when organisers shared the event on a local community Facebook page, prompting multiple homophobic and transphobic people to crawl out of the woodwork and start threatening performers and community members. \u201cI had people saying that they wanted to take me out to the bush, my performers out to the bush to do away with them,\u201d Karney Doll said in an interview with the ABC . \u201cThere was hate comments towards the trans, gay community, things saying that being gay is the gateway to paedophilia, it was just really, really hurtful.\u201d Although she reported the comments to SA Police and hired private security for the night, about half of the performers dropped out due to safety concerns. Feast Festival Condemns Abhorrent Behaviour Unfortunately, the incident was not isolated. Queer organisers in Burra , another rural SA town, also faced discrimination online when promoting their third annual Country Pride Picnic . The event was also part of Feast Festival. \u201cIt was really unexpected to receive this sort of pushback from the general community and it is hurtful for LGBTQIA+ people to have that negative feedback put on us, it\u2019s just really shocking for this day and age,\u201d Organiser and Burra local Deb Selway said. Despite the threats of violence and increased security presence, both events took place without incident. Feast Festival CEO, Tish Naughton condemned the queerphobic comments. \u201cFeast has a zero tolerance on homophobic and transphobic abuse,\u201d she said. \u201cThis behaviour incites hate and currently LGBTIQA+ South Australians have no protection from vilification and hate speech under South Australian law.\u201d Naughton also pushed for more expansive hate speech laws to be passed in the state, similar to the ones seen in Victoria . \u201cAll South Australians deserve to be protected against vilification and hate, and we call on the South Australian Government to make it unlawful to incite hate, serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of, a person or group on the grounds of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and/or expression, intersex status, HIV/AIDS status, disability, race or religion.\u201d Rhys Nicholson Bringing Acclaimed Comedy Show To Adelaide Carols By Queerlight Popchops \u2013 SWEAT: A Cult Classic Queer Pop Party Queens of the Pool with Art Simone Harry K Takes Over Enigma Nightclub For Huge XXXMAS Bash Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

                    "content": "Prayagraj: The main aim of the Uniform Civil Code is to promote social harmony, gender equality and secularism, Allahabad High Court Judge Dr Shekhar Yadav has said at a VHP function. The judge made the remarks on Sunday while addressing a provincial convention of the Legal Cell and High Court Unit of the Vishva Hindu Parishad in Allahabad High Court. A day later, videos of the judge speaking on provocative issues, including the law working according to the majority, were circulated widely, triggering a strong reaction from various opposition parties which questioned his reported statements and labelled them hate speech. \u201cThe main objective of the Uniform Civil Code is to promote social harmony, gender equality and secularism by eliminating unequal legal systems based on different religions and communities,\u201d he said, according to a release issued by the VHP. \u201cA Uniform Civil Code refers to a common law that applies to all religious communities in personal matters such as marriage, inheritance, divorce, adoption etc,\u201d he said. \u201cThe aim of the Uniform Civil Code is to replace various personal laws that currently govern personal matters within different religious communities.

                    "content": "Controversy had been stirred even before the Vishwa Hindu Parishad\u2019s event on the \u201cConstitutional Necessity of Uniform Civil Code\u201d took place in Prayagraj on Sunday. Critics questioned the appropriateness of a programme by a Hindutva organisation being allowed on the premises of the Allahabad High Court and about the decision of a sitting judge Shekhar Kumar Yadav to participate. At the event, Yadav demonstrated that their fears were not unjustified. In his speech , the judge declared that India would run as per the wishes of its majority. He also used a communal slur to refer to Muslims and in a thinly-veiled dig, described the community as \u201charmful to the country\u201d. Given Yadav\u2019s judicial record, his address, echoing the communal rhetoric of Hindutva organisations, was not a surprise. Scroll looked at several of his orders over the last three-and-a-half years and found that Yadav has a pattern of referring to Hindutva talking points. In his judgements, he has suggested that the state should honour the cow as well as Hindu gods, referred to conspiracy theories about religious conversions and accused people of making false complaints under the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes Prevention of Atrocities Act. He has even openly praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav of the #AllahabadHighCourt ignited a major controversy on Sunday by attending an event organised by the legal cell of right-wing organisation Vishwa Hindu Parishad ( #VHP ). The judge made contentious statements against the #Muslim community and stated... pic.twitter.com/mNA8PQr1RT \u2014 Hate Detector \ud83d\udd0d (@HateDetectors) December 9, 2024 Reverence towards the cow Before Sunday, Yadav was perhaps best known for a judgement he had delivered in September 2021 in which he had denied bail to a man accused of killing a cow. Cattle slaughter is prohibited in Uttar Pradesh. In the judgement, Yadav had called on the government to declare the cow as the national animal and make cow protection every Hindu\u2019s fundamental right. \u201cOnly if cow is revered, the country will prosper,\u201d he declared. He said that eating beef could not be considered a fundamental right and held the right to life of a cow above it. He rued the shoddy condition of India\u2019s cattle. \u201cThe cow is the culture of India and the work of saving the culture is of every citizen living in the country, irrespective of religion or worship,\u201d Yadav said. He also claimed that the cow is the only animal that exhales oxygen rather than carbon dioxide and that ghee made from cow milk used during Hindu rituals \u201cgives special energy to sunrays, which ultimately causes rains\u201d. He also said that \u201ccow milk, curd, ghee, urine and cow dung helps in treatment of several incurable diseases\u201d. In October 2021, while granting bail to a person accused of making offensive remarks about the Hindu deities Rama and Krishna on social media, Yadav observed that both \u201creside in the heart of Indians\u201d. He went on that Rama is \u201cthe soul, identity, culture of this country and without \u2018Rama\u2019, India is incomplete\u201d. In his order, he called on Parliament to honour both the deities, along with the Bhagvad Gita and its author Valmiki, and the Ramayana and its author Ved Vyasa. In June 2022, while granting bail to someone accused of cow slaughter, Yadav imposed a bizarre bail condition. The accused was ordered to donate Rs 1 lakh to any registered cow shelter in his district and work there for a month. While hearing an application for anticipatory bail in another cow slaughter case last year, Yadav had accused the Uttar Pradesh police of laxity in investigating cow slaughter cases. He had alleged that the number of cow slaughter cases was increasing in the state, though he did not offer any data to support this. Yadav subsequently ordered the Police Commissioner of Prayagraj district to file a progress report on the status of all cow slaughter cases that had been registered in the district. In April 2022, Yadav had made unsolicited references to Hindu rites in an order disposing a petition filed by a woman seeking the custody of her daughter. The petitioner had alleged that her daughter had been detained by another woman. The daughter and her alleged captor had told the court that they were in a same-sex marriage and living together consensually. While same-sex marriage is not legally recognised in India, Yadav dismissed the legitimacy of the marriage without reference only to the law. Instead, since both the women were Hindus, he said that under Hindu personal law, the marriage sacrament is valid only when it is between a man and a woman. In the order, Yadav equated \u201cHindu law\u201d with \u201cIndian culture\u201d and \u201cIndian values\u201d. Promoting conspiracy theories In at least two decisions, Yadav has referred to popular conspiracy theories without furnishing proof for their validity. In August last year, Yadav granted anticipatory bail to a man accused of raping a minor girl. In the concluding part of his order, Yadav said that women are filing false first information reports under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act as well as the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act against innocent persons \u201cjust for taking money from the state.\u201d He added, \u201c...In maximum cases the women is using it as a weapon just to grab money, which should be stopped.\u201d He did not explain how he had come to this conclusion. In July 2021, Yadav appeared to support the so-called Love Jihad conspiracy theory that suggests that Muslim men are involved in an organised attempt to woo and marry Hindu women in order to convert them to Islam. Yadav denied bail to a Muslim man accused under the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Act of fraudulently converting a Hindu woman to Islam for marriage. In his order, Yadav reproduced, without any scepticism, the submission of the prosecution that \u201c[n]owadays, many such cases are being seen on TV and in newspapers wherein poor, helpless, dumb and deaf women are brainwashed\u201d. The prosecution added, \u201cSuch people are encouraged and funded from abroad, just to weaken the country.\u201d While Yadav did not cite this as part of his reasoning for denying bail, his decision to accept the submission uncritically or demand proof may have indicated that he agreed with the argument. Appeasing Union government In at least two orders, Yadav also appeared to display political partisanship. In December 2021, in an order granting bail, Yadav went on a tangent unrelated to the case at hand and praised \u201cthe honourable Prime Minister of our country for his campaign to provide free Covid vaccination in a country with a massive population like India\u201d. The next month, in an order denying bail to persons accused of fraudulently withdrawing money from the account of a retired High Court judge, Yadav agreed with the contention of the Union government counsel that the government would file a review petition against the Supreme Court\u2019s 2018 judgement that made it illegal to mandatorily link Aadhaar cards with bank accounts. Yadav wrote that if Aadhar cards could be linked with bank accounts, it would be easier to prevent online bank fraud. This was judicially inappropriate by Yadav because a High Court judge is bound by the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence and cannot express an opinion in a judgement doubting a Supreme Court decision or asking for it to be overturned. It was also factually inaccurate since a review petition against the judgement by the Union government to make it compulsory for Aadhaar card holders to link them to their bank accounts had already been dismissed in June 2021. The Allahabad High Court. | Sanjay Kanojia / AFP Yadav\u2019s appointment to High Court According to the Allahabad High Court website , Yadav is a graduate of the Allahabad University and enrolled as an advocate in 1990. As an advocate, he had served as an additional government advocate and standing counsel for Uttar Pradesh and as Additional Chief Standing Counsel and Senior Counsel of the Union government. He had also served as Senior Counsel of Railway and as Standing Counsel of the VBS Purvanchal University, Jaunpur. Yadav was recommended for appointment as an additional judge of the Allahabad High Court on February 12, 2019, by the Supreme Court collegium consisting of then Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi and Justices AK Sikri and SA Bobde. The Union government gave effect to the recommendation on December 12, 2019. On March 5, 2021, Yadav was recommended for appointment as a permanent judge of the High Court by a Supreme Court collegium consisting of Chief Justice of India Bobde and Justices NV Ramana and RF Nariman. The Union government implemented the recommendation on March 23, 2021. In neither of the Supreme Court collegium recommendations were any reasons disclosed for Yadav\u2019s elevation to the High Court bench or his appointment as a permanent judge. Yadav is scheduled to retire from the High Court on April 15, 2026.",

Justice Shekhar Yadav, a sitting judge of the Allahabad High Court, addressed a VHP meeting. That he should do so is bad enough. That he should promote majoritarian views and communal hatred is unacceptable. Supreme Court should take suo moto notice and sack him!\" On 8th December, the sitting judge of the Allahabad High Court, Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav, attended and spoke at an event organised by the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) legal cell in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh. In his address at the event, he emphasised the cultural and constitutional significance of Bhagwan Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, the urgency of implementing a Uniform Civil Code (UCC), and the role of the majority in shaping the future of India. In his speech, Justice Yadav covered a wide range of topics, from societal reforms to national unity. Justice Yadav began his address by paying tribute to the sacrifices made by countless individuals for the construction of Bhavya Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh. He said, \u201cDid you imagine seeing the Ram Mandir with your own eyes? Many of our ancestors made sacrifices in the hope of seeing Ram Lalla freed and witnessing the construction of a grand temple. They couldn\u2019t see it but did their part, but now, we are witnessing it (the temple).\u201d He expressed optimism about the implementation of the UCC and assured the audience that the day is not far when UCC will become a reality. He said, \u201cI assure you, you will see this (UCC) bill very soon. The day is not far when it will be clear that if there is one country, there should be one law, and one penal law. Those who try to deceive or run their own agendas will not last long.\u201d Justice Yadav took an oath in the historic library hall of the Allahabad High Court and declared, \u201cThis country will definitely bring a uniform law, and it will bring it very soon.\u201d Referring to the 1985 Shah Bano case in the Supreme Court of India that upheld the right to maintenance irrespective of religion, he called the case a stepping stone for the implementation of the UCC. Justice Yadav remarked on the principle that the interests of the majority are central to governance in a democracy like India. He said, \u201cI have no hesitation in saying that this is Hindustan; this country would function as per the wishes of the bahusankhyak (majority) living in Hindustan. This is the law. The law, in fact, works according to the majority. Look at it in the context of family or society... Only what benefits the welfare and happiness of the majority will be accepted.\u201d He further stressed that such principles ensure the harmony and welfare of society at large. Moving further in his address, Justice Yadav criticised the discriminatory practices that affect women in certain communities and called them unconstitutional. He said, \u201cIf you say that our personal law allows this, it will not be accepted. A woman will receive maintenance, bigamy will not be allowed, and a man will have only one wife, not four wives... If one sister receives maintenance and the other does not, then that creates discrimination, which is against the Constitution.\u201d Justice Yadav strongly condemned practices like Halala and Triple Talaq and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t disrespect a woman who has been recognised as a goddess in our Shastras and Vedas. You can\u2019t claim the right to have four wives, perform Halala, or practise Triple Talaq. This right will not work.\u201d In relation to such practices, he emphasised that UCC is not only supported by organisations like RSS and VHP but that the Supreme Court of India has also advocated for it, suggesting it is a constitutional necessity. In his address, Justice Yadav elaborated on the broad definition of being Hindu. He said, \u201cA person who takes a dip in the Ganga or applies chandan is not the only definition of being Hindu. Anyone who considers this land their mother and is willing to lay down their life for the country in times of crisis, regardless of their religious practices or beliefs, whether they follow the Quran or the Bible, is a Hindu.\u201d He further underlined the importance of respecting the culture, heritage, and great personalities of India. He said, \u201cIt is not expected for Muslims to follow our culture, but it is definitely expected that they do not disrespect the culture of this country, the great personalities, and the God of this land.\u201d Justice Yadav issued a stern warning against certain elements within society that are disruptive. He referred to such elements as \u201cKathmulla\u201d, a term usually used for Muslims, who hinder national progress. He said, \u201cThe word may be inappropriate, but there is no hesitation in saying it because they (\u2018Kathmulla\u2019) are harmful to the country. They are people who incite the public, and they are the ones who prevent the country from progressing.\u201d He further issued a warning that if Indians fail to uphold their cultural values, \u201cIt won\u2019t take long for this country to become like Bangladesh or the Taliban.\u201d He also drew comparisons between how children are raised across communities. He pointed out that values of compassion and non-violence are deep-rooted in Hindu traditions. He questioned, \u201cIn our country, we are taught not to harm even the smallest animals, not to kill ants, and this lesson is ingrained in us. Perhaps that is why we are tolerant and compassionate; we feel pain when others suffer. But you do not have this. Why? In your culture, from a young age, children are exposed to the slaughter of animals. How can you expect them to be tolerant and compassionate?\u201d While concluding his address, Justice Yadav urged the people of India to recognise the significance of their cultural identity and values. He said, \u201cI won\u2019t say \u2018ek rahenge to safe rahenge,\u2019 but would say that once these values are realised, no one can harm us.\u201d Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav\u2019s address at the VHP\u2019s event has drawn sharp reactions from the left-liberal cabal. They have accused the sitting judge of the Allahabad High Court of making controversial statements favouring one community over others. His support for the UCC, critique of Islamic practices like Triple Talaq and Halala, and emphasis on the role of the majority in shaping the country triggered outrage to the extent that some demanded action against him by the apex court. CPI(M), from its official handle on X, wrote, \u201cHis speech is akin to hate speech. Justice Shekhar Yadav, a sitting judge of the Allahabad High Court, addressed a VHP meeting.

It is associated with RSS, an organisation that Vallabhai Patel banned for being a \u2018force of hate and violence.\u2019 It is unfortunate that a High Court judge attended the conference of such an organisation. This \u201cspeech\u201d can be easily rebutted, but it\u2019s more important to remind his honour that the Constitution of India expects judicial independence & impartiality. May I direct his attention to AoR Association vs Union of India \u201cImpartiality, independence, fairness and reasonableness in decision-making are the hallmarks of the judiciary.\u201d The Constitution of India is not majoritarian but a democratic one. In a democracy, the minority\u2019s rights are protected. As Ambedkar put it \u201c...as a King has no Divine Right to rule, so also a majority has no Divine Right to rule.\u201d This speech indicts the collegium system and raises questions on judicial impartiality. How can a minority party expect justice before someone who participates in VHP\u2019s programs?\u201d, Owaisi wrote. The VHP was banned on various occasions. It is associated with RSS, an organisation that Vallabhai Patel banned for being a \u2018force of hate and violence.\u2019 It is unfortunate that a High Court judge attended the conference of such an organisation. This \u201cspeech\u201d can be easily... https://t.co/IMce7aYbcf Just a couple of days before Justice Shekhar Yadav\u2019s address, Owaisi was reposting speech excerpts of former Justice Rohinton Nariman. The left-liberals condemned Justice Yadav\u2019s remarks and labelled them divisive. They argued that his statements were inappropriate for a sitting judge and reignited debates on judicial propriety and ideological bias among members of the judiciary. Interestingly, the same left-liberal cabal crying foul over Justice Yadav\u2019s remarks lauded former Supreme Court judge Rohinton Nariman for his sharp critique of the 2019 Ayodhya verdict, delivered just days before the VHP event. Justice Nariman, during a lecture for the Ahmadi Foundation on 6th December, two days before Justice Yadav\u2019s address, called the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on Ram Janmabhoomi a \u201cmockery of justice\u201d and accused the five-judge bench of violating \u201csecularism, which, according to him, is a basic feature of the Constitution.\u201d Justice Nariman went further, describing the VHP-led karseva movement as \u201cdictatorial\u201d and the demand for the Ram Mandir as \u201ctyrannical.\u201d He claimed that the Places of Worship Act was disregarded in the Ayodhya judgment and criticised notices being served to mosques and dargahs, terming them \u201chydra heads\u201d that could incite communal discord. He argued that the strict enforcement of the 1991 law, which prevents Hindus from pursuing historical claims, is the only way to ensure communal harmony. Despite his harsh criticism of Hindus, Justice Nariman was widely celebrated by the left-liberal ecosystem. This stark contrast in the reception of similar issues, depending on the speaker and their stance, highlights the ideological bias prevalent among left-liberal circles. Justice Yadav\u2019s call for cultural respect and constitutional uniformity was branded divisive, whereas Justice Nariman\u2019s pointed remarks, which dismissed centuries of injustice faced by Hindus, were applauded as progressive. The selective outrage undoubtedly raises questions about the deep-rooted ideological bias among left-liberals. Justice Nariman\u2019s statement that \u201csecularism would only have been upheld if Hindus had abandoned their claim\u201d underscores the one-sided expectations placed on the Hindu community. His criticism of notices to mosques and dargahs, without acknowledging the historical destruction of Hindu temples, further reveals the hypocrisy of those claiming to champion secular values. Former Justice Nariman also expressed disappointment over the failure to rebuild a mosque on the disputed site after the demolition of the Babri structure, calling it a \u201ctravesty of justice.\u201d However, he overlooked the fact that Hindus adhered to the legal process for decades, seeking rightful ownership of their place of worship. Had the Hindu community acted outside the law, the disputed structure known as the \u201cBabri Masjid\u201d would not have stood until 1992, nor would the Ram Mandir have been planned nearly three decades later, only after the court ruled in favour of the Hindu community. There are certain elements of irony about the whole secularism sermon by Nariman. Former Justice Rohinton Nariman\u2019s father, the late Fali S Nariman, once criticised Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath becoming the head of the state because he is a Hindu priest. He claimed that CM Yogi\u2019s appointment was a threat to secularism. However, he completely ignored the fact that his son, Justice Rohinton Nariman, is himself a Parsi priest. Rohinton was ordained at the age of 12 and performed religious ceremonies. He has credited his priesthood for shaping his life and career. The starkly different receptions to Justice Yadav and Justice Nariman\u2019s statements expose a deep-seated bias within sections of the left-liberal ecosystem. While one judge is vilified for his calls to respect the Constitution and cultural heritage, another is glorified despite undermining the historical and legal struggles of a community. This selective appreciation serves as a glaring example of the hypocrisy that continues to plague public discourse on India\u2019s socio-religious landscape.",

                    "content": "Josh Bornstein likes to argue. It\u2019s why he found himself in the awkward position of defending the employment of Israel Folau when the rest of Australia wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s why he became a lawyer, learning from an early age he could get paid for his favourite activity. It is also why he\u2019s sitting across from me at a table at the Royal Oak Hotel demanding I say something critical about his new book. Workplace lawyer Josh Bornstein at the Royal Oak Hotel in Fitzroy North. Credit: Eddie Jim I decline the opportunity to pick a fight, trying to steer the conversation towards parts of the book I found interesting. \u201cWho do you think it will offend the most?\u201d Bornstein asks as he sips a Heaps Normal non-alcoholic beer. I\u2019m having a Carlton Draught and we\u2019ve both chosen tap water that we never end up touching. The labour, and Labor, lawyer has become a bit of an expert on what offends people. His book, W orking for the Brand , is not just a study in corporations, but into whether \u201ccancel culture\u201d lets companies and institutions control our lives. Using our employment to demonstrate what is right and wrong. Loading No one is surprised Bornstein has a critical view of corporations and that he believes a stronger union movement is the solution to the woes he sees in the world. Now one of Australia\u2019s leading workplace lawyers, he cut his teeth on waterfront disputes and works for Maurice Blackburn, the long-time Labor- and union-linked law firm. Most recently, he was involved in the major court win for Transport Workers\u2019 Union, where Qantas was found to have illegally sacked 1700 ground staff during the pandemic. Three test cases have set the stage for a potential multimillion-dollar compensation bill. Perhaps that heritage is why Bornstein chose the Royal Oak Hotel in Fitzroy North for our lunch. The former dive has been renovated to look like it hails from a time when Labor Party meetings were held exclusively at pubs. It\u2019s been a feature of the neighbourhood since 1871. The scallop pie at the Royal Oak Hotel. Credit: Eddie Jim Before he settles in to explain his book, he orders a scallop pie. I opt for the eye fillet. After some dithering, we agree to share a broccoli and farro salad. The pub has a cosy vibe as we gossip about the latest machinations in Labor politics, and some colourful characters who share a mutual dislike of us both. Bornstein hasn\u2019t been afraid to make enemies from all walks of life. He admits he drives his own friends mad through his contrarian tendencies. But one thing that separates him from some comrades on the left is his belief that \u2013 in most cases \u2013 your opinion shouldn\u2019t cost you your job. \u201cEven if you\u2019re wrong or annoying, you shouldn\u2019t be smashed into oblivion, lose your career and end up being offshore. That\u2019s horrific,\u201d Bornstein says. The eye fillet. Credit: Eddie Jim \u201cThe corporations that run the online world foster this culture. There is, in both the left and the right, a propensity to try and punish your foes by shaming them and getting them sacked. \u201cThere are examples of people being sacked, shamed and blacklisted for cracking a joke that wasn\u2019t understood as a joke.\u201d One famous example, Bornstein says, is PR consultant Justine Sacco, who in 2013 stepped off a plane in South Africa to find her life ruined by an online pile-on from a tweet she sent before take-off: \u201cGoing to Africa. Hope I don\u2019t get Aids. Just kidding. I\u2019m white!\u201d Another is sports reporter Scott McIntyre, who walked into a culture war over Anzac Day in 2015 by criticising parts of Australia\u2019s war history and was sacked by SBS. Writer Yassmin Abdel-Magied left the country after her 2017 Twitter post about Anzac Day led to weeks of media and online pile-ons. Loading The algorithms of the internet reward brutality and \u201cColosseum-style\u201d justice, Bornstein argues, and this arrangement allows employers to be moral arbiters. \u201cThey were cancelled so badly, they ceased to almost exist in Australia. Yet corporations don\u2019t get in the same sort of trouble,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I discovered, through my work, is that corporations now wield far more power over what we\u2019re allowed to say or do than any democratic government could legitimately dream of. \u201cThat\u2019s evolved over the last 30 or 40 years, as the labour market has been de-unionised and everyone\u2019s been put on identical contracts. \u201cYou\u2019ll have one [contract] and it\u2019ll say you\u2019re required to comply with our policies, which will vary from time to time. Unilaterally we can just change the policy, and you won\u2019t have any say over that. \u201cThe policies will vary a bit, but they\u2019ll all ultimately end up requiring you not to say or do anything controversial.\u201d It is this thesis which left Bornstein into the not-altogether-comfortable position of publicly defending the employment of former rugby star Israel Folau . Folau was sacked by Rugby Australia in 2019 after posting on social media that \u201cdrunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists, idolaters\u201d needed to atone for their sins. Enter Bornstein, the man who loves to argue. He said the Folau saga demonstrated the overreach of corporate Australia and argued that Jesus Christ himself would be unemployable under our current social contract. Israel Folau in 2018 when he was playing for Australia. Credit: Getty \u201cI got a lot of heat about that and, to some extent, my views got embraced by the right, even though I think they misunderstood my position,\u201d he says over lunch. \u201cIt was a very awkward position to be in, but you\u2019ve just got to try and in that situation, argue on principle, see where it takes you and not flinch too much.\u201d As our meals come out, Bornstein is just warming up and orders a white wine, a Campuget Viognier. I opt for another draught. The lawyer makes it clear he isn\u2019t defending Folau\u2019s opinions, but says too much of the debate about what is hateful or harmful speech is determined by the companies who hire people rather than the voters and elected politicians. \u2018A corporation in the middle of a brand management, online Colosseum crisis, that\u2019s the worst possible environment to try and deal with very complicated issues.\u2019 Josh Bornstein \u201cIf it is hateful, then parliament should address that because at least that is a democratic process,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are plenty of laws that address harmful speech, and I support them generally, so it\u2019s always a debate about what is the line. \u201cA corporation in the middle of a brand management, online Colosseum crisis, that\u2019s the worst possible environment to try and deal with very complicated issues.\u201d Loading Speaking of complicated issues, Bornstein finished his book just as the war in Gaza became a focal point in global politics, and he says this has changed the discussion on free speech. ABC presenter Antoinette Lattouf was taken off air after she posted on social media about the conflict, and a censorship row engulfed the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra when pianist Jayson Graham made remarks about a piece dedicated to Palestinian journalists killed in Gaza. \u201cA lot of the left who have been leading the charge against free speech and microaggressions ... are now embracing the idea that they should be allowed to upset their opponents,\u201d Bornstein says. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that the left learns from that a bit, that there\u2019ll be some evolution in the thinking about identity politics because of Gaza.\u201d Our jobs, Bornstein says, are central to how we see ourselves in the world, and he often recommends clients speak to a mental health professional because of the devastating psychological impact of losing a job, no matter the reason. \u201cThere\u2019s dignity, there\u2019s meaning, there\u2019s self-esteem and financial security. That\u2019s a very potent cocktail when that\u2019s suddenly removed. It\u2019s very rare for someone not to be badly impacted,\u201d he says. Josh Bornstein and Antoinette Lattouf outside the Federal Court in February. Credit: Kate Geraghty As we share a chocolate mousse, Bornstein explains his own personal experiences with being cancelled. The lawyer was targeted online after supporting racial discrimination laws and received death threats from a man who was ultimately intercepted by the FBI. Years later, feelings of fear came flooding back when a dossier of his most controversial tweets was used against his bid to be preselected by Labor for a Senate spot. \u201cWhen I was silly enough to put my head up for preselection ... my phone went nuts,\u201d he says. Loading \u201cI thought I\u2019d bounced back remarkably well, but that was very frightening how so quickly my resistance was not there.\u201d Bornstein says this is why we complain politicians are often wooden, synthetic and not genuine. The ideal preselection candidate is someone who has never done anything. He\u2019s not interested in putting his hand up again and says things won\u2019t change until politicians advocate for people who are infallible. \u201cUnless they\u2019re willing to have that argument and win the argument, you\u2019re going to continue to get pretty homogenous colourless candidates,\u201d he says. After Bornstein leaves, a couple sitting at a nearby table waves me over as I pay the bill. They heard parts of the conversation and just happen to be avid rugby fans, but they\u2019ve got a different view to Bornstein. \u201cIsrael Folau was part of a team and when you\u2019re part of a team you sign up to play by their rules for the good of everyone. If you can\u2019t do that it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d they tell me. It is a good point and one I\u2019d like to hear rebutted. Turns out Bornstein came to the right place for an argument, he just chose the wrong table.

It\u2019s why he became a lawyer, learning from an early age he could get paid for his favourite activity. It is also why he\u2019s sitting across from me at a table at the Royal Oak Hotel demanding I say something critical about his new book.

Using our employment to demonstrate what is right and wrong. No one is surprised Bornstein has a critical view of corporations and that he believes a stronger union movement is the solution to the woes he sees in the world. Now one of Australia\u2019s leading workplace lawyers, he cut his teeth on waterfront disputes and works for Maurice Blackburn, the long-time Labor- and union-linked law firm. Most recently, he was involved in the major court win for Transport Workers\u2019 Union, where Qantas was found to have illegally sacked 1700 ground staff during the pandemic. Three test cases have set the stage for a potential multimillion-dollar compensation bill. Perhaps that heritage is why Bornstein chose the Royal Oak Hotel in Fitzroy North for our lunch.

After some dithering, we agree to share a broccoli and farro salad. The pub has a cosy vibe as we gossip about the latest machinations in Labor politics, and some colourful characters who share a mutual dislike of us both. Bornstein hasn\u2019t been afraid to make enemies from all walks of life. He admits he drives his own friends mad through his contrarian tendencies. But one thing that separates him from some comrades on the left is his belief that \u2013 in most cases \u2013 your opinion shouldn\u2019t cost you your job. \u201cEven if you\u2019re wrong or annoying, you shouldn\u2019t be smashed into oblivion, lose your career and end up being offshore. That\u2019s horrific,\u201d Bornstein says. The eye fillet. Credit: Eddie Jim \u201cThe corporations that run the online world foster this culture. There is, in both the left and the right, a propensity to try and punish your foes by shaming them and getting them sacked. \u201cThere are examples of people being sacked, shamed and blacklisted for cracking a joke that wasn\u2019t understood as a joke.\u201d One famous example, Bornstein says, is PR consultant Justine Sacco, who in 2013 stepped off a plane in South Africa to find her life ruined by an online pile-on from a tweet she sent before take-off: \u201cGoing to Africa. Hope I don\u2019t get Aids. Just kidding. I\u2019m white!\u201d Another is sports reporter Scott McIntyre, who walked into a culture war over Anzac Day in 2015 by criticising parts of Australia\u2019s war history and was sacked by SBS. Writer Yassmin Abdel-Magied left the country after her 2017 Twitter post about Anzac Day led to weeks of media and online pile-ons. The algorithms of the internet reward brutality and \u201cColosseum-style\u201d justice, Bornstein argues, and this arrangement allows employers to be moral arbiters. \u201cThey were cancelled so badly, they ceased to almost exist in Australia. Yet corporations don\u2019t get in the same sort of trouble,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I discovered, through my work, is that corporations now wield far more power over what we\u2019re allowed to say or do than any democratic government could legitimately dream of. \u201cThat\u2019s evolved over the last 30 or 40 years, as the labour market has been de-unionised and everyone\u2019s been put on identical contracts. \u201cYou\u2019ll have one [contract] and it\u2019ll say you\u2019re required to comply with our policies, which will vary from time to time. Unilaterally we can just change the policy, and you won\u2019t have any say over that. \u201cThe policies will vary a bit, but they\u2019ll all ultimately end up requiring you not to say or do anything controversial.\u201d It is this thesis which left Bornstein into the not-altogether-comfortable position of publicly defending the employment of former rugby star Israel Folau . Folau was sacked by Rugby Australia in 2019 after posting on social media that \u201cdrunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists, idolaters\u201d needed to atone for their sins. Enter Bornstein, the man who loves to argue. He said the Folau saga demonstrated the overreach of corporate Australia and argued that Jesus Christ himself would be unemployable under our current social contract. Israel Folau in 2018 when he was playing for Australia. Credit: Getty \u201cI got a lot of heat about that and, to some extent, my views got embraced by the right, even though I think they misunderstood my position,\u201d he says over lunch. \u201cIt was a very awkward position to be in, but you\u2019ve just got to try and in that situation, argue on principle, see where it takes you and not flinch too much.\u201d As our meals come out, Bornstein is just warming up and orders a white wine, a Campuget Viognier. I opt for another draught. The lawyer makes it clear he isn\u2019t defending Folau\u2019s opinions, but says too much of the debate about what is hateful or harmful speech is determined by the companies who hire people rather than the voters and elected politicians. \u2018A corporation in the middle of a brand management, online Colosseum crisis, that\u2019s the worst possible environment to try and deal with very complicated issues.\u2019 \u201cIf it is hateful, then parliament should address that because at least that is a democratic process,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are plenty of laws that address harmful speech, and I support them generally, so it\u2019s always a debate about what is the line. \u201cA corporation in the middle of a brand management, online Colosseum crisis, that\u2019s the worst possible environment to try and deal with very complicated issues.\u201d Speaking of complicated issues, Bornstein finished his book just as the war in Gaza became a focal point in global politics, and he says this has changed the discussion on free speech. ABC presenter Antoinette Lattouf was taken off air after she posted on social media about the conflict, and a censorship row engulfed the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra when pianist Jayson Graham made remarks about a piece dedicated to Palestinian journalists killed in Gaza. \u201cA lot of the left who have been leading the charge against free speech and microaggressions ... are now embracing the idea that they should be allowed to upset their opponents,\u201d Bornstein says. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that the left learns from that a bit, that there\u2019ll be some evolution in the thinking about identity politics because of Gaza.\u201d Our jobs, Bornstein says, are central to how we see ourselves in the world, and he often recommends clients speak to a mental health professional because of the devastating psychological impact of losing a job, no matter the reason. \u201cThere\u2019s dignity, there\u2019s meaning, there\u2019s self-esteem and financial security. That\u2019s a very potent cocktail when that\u2019s suddenly removed. It\u2019s very rare for someone not to be badly impacted,\u201d he says. Josh Bornstein and Antoinette Lattouf outside the Federal Court in February. Credit: Kate Geraghty As we share a chocolate mousse, Bornstein explains his own personal experiences with being cancelled. The lawyer was targeted online after supporting racial discrimination laws and received death threats from a man who was ultimately intercepted by the FBI. Years later, feelings of fear came flooding back when a dossier of his most controversial tweets was used against his bid to be preselected by Labor for a Senate spot. \u201cWhen I was silly enough to put my head up for preselection ... my phone went nuts,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought I\u2019d bounced back remarkably well, but that was very frightening how so quickly my resistance was not there.\u201d Bornstein says this is why we complain politicians are often wooden, synthetic and not genuine. The ideal preselection candidate is someone who has never done anything. He\u2019s not interested in putting his hand up again and says things won\u2019t change until politicians advocate for people who are infallible. \u201cUnless they\u2019re willing to have that argument and win the argument, you\u2019re going to continue to get pretty homogenous colourless candidates,\u201d he says. After Bornstein leaves, a couple sitting at a nearby table waves me over as I pay the bill. They heard parts of the conversation and just happen to be avid rugby fans, but they\u2019ve got a different view to Bornstein. \u201cIsrael Folau was part of a team and when you\u2019re part of a team you sign up to play by their rules for the good of everyone. If you can\u2019t do that it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d they tell me. It is a good point and one I\u2019d like to hear rebutted.

READ MORE: Meghan Markle dazzles in diamonds at Hollywood gala By MARTIN ROBINSON, CHIEF REPORTER Published: 16:12 GMT, 8 December 2024 | Updated: 16:12 GMT, 8 December 2024 e-mail View comments Prince Harry and Meghan have vowed to remain politically neutral in public. And the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's charity the Archewell Foundation prides itself on being non-partisan supporters of good causes in America and around the world. But while their decision to enter a $250,000 partnership with US President Joe Biden's daughter Ashley to support traumatised women has won plaudits, it has also raised eyebrows, especially after the recent row over Harry's US visa application. Greg Swenson, a London-based financier and Chairman of Republicans Overseas UK, told MailOnline today that it is another sign of the closeness between the Sussex and Biden camps. He said: 'The Hollywood and LA scene is very Democrat . 'It shouldn\u2019t be any surprise that Harry and Meghan would be connected with the Biden family, given their elite lifestyle and progressive friends'. He added: 'Although it seems to be virtue signalling, I don\u2019t think there is any harm in supporting a charity', but added that given the recent row over Joe Biden's decision to pardon his own son Hunter, the Sussexes would be 'probably wise to stay away from them'. This week it emerged that the Archewell Foundation is a founding partner at a wellness hub for women impacted by trauma which pioneers a radical new type of therapy that Ashley Biden credits with helping her process her brother Beau's death at the age of just 46 in 2015. Based in north Philadelphia, the Women's Wellness (Spa)ce was created by Ashley who envisioned the space as a 'drop-in space where women can eat a healthy meal, hit the treadmill or box, listen to guided meditation, and access therapies including EMDR and infrared saunas'. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have released their annual report for their charity the Archewell Foundation, which revealed a new link with the Bidens The Duke and Duchess of Sussex , who insisted that they would remain politically neutral in public ahead of the State's presidential election in November, are now connected with the First Daughter (pictured with President Biden in 2017), 43, through a non-partisan initiative Prince Harry and Joe Biden watch USA Vs Denmark in the wheelchair rugby match at the Invictus Games Orlando in 2016 The Duke and Duchess of Sussex urged Americans to 'reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity' and register to vote in the 2020 US election In a court decision handed down in September, US District Judge Carl Nichols said the court agreed that Prince Harry's 'privacy interest outweighs any public interest' after Biden administration lawyers won the case to keep the documents sealed Ashley Biden, 43, is a social worker whose passion is helping women released from prison, and according to tax documents Harry and Meghan's charity gave her project $250,000 a year or more ago. It is yet another sign that the Sussexes have become close to the Bidens, who have been highly supportive of the Invictus Games, which celebrated its ten-year anniversary this year. Harry has also had the headache of a legal battle over his visa application in recent months. He moved to Montecito with Meghan Markle and Archie in 2020 but his 2023 memoir Spare reveals he took cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms as a younger man. Visa applicants must by law declare whether they have taken drugs - and if the lied on their forms they could be deported. But the Biden administration is said to have helped support him by refusing to release the Duke's application in a claim brought by a conservative think tank in New York earlier this year. Conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation had sued the Department of Homeland Security, demanding that the American public must know if Harry disclosed his drug use on his visa application - but lost. After the Heritage Foundation tried to overturn the decision, lawyers for the Biden administration responded by doubling down on its defence of the handling of Harry's move to the US in 2020. A Government court filing read: 'The evidence before the Court plainly sufficed to show that [Heritage's] speculation of impropriety was unfounded\u2019. Donald Trump could, however, intervene to have it released when he takes office in January. He has already said he is 'no fan' of Meghan. Harry and Meghan stayed quiet before the 2024 election, with some saying that not upsetting Mr Trump was a priority given the row over his immigration status. But in 2020 they appeared to back Joe Biden when they made a video urging Americans to go out and vote to 'reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity'. Meghan herself has long been rumoured to have political ambitions - but these have not yet materialised. Ms Markle is said to have approached California Governor Gavin Newsom about whether he would support her replacing Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein, who died last September. But another candidate was chosen. Beau Biden tragically passed away at the age of 46 in 2015 after being diagnosed with an aggressive brain cancer , glioblastoma. His death is just one in a series of tragedies that have befallen the Biden family; with the president's first wife Neilia, mother to Beau and Hunter, and one-year-old sister, Naomi, dying in a car accident in 1972. Harry and Meghan's support for Ashley's centre was revealed in the foundation's Impact Report for the 2023-2024 year, which was published on Monday and illustrates the Duke and Duchess' philanthropic efforts through the organisation that they founded in 2020. The Impact Report for the Archewell Foundation's third full year has been released Meghan hugs a young woman at one of the couple's Archewell-related events with Harry out of shot to her left Harry and Meghan together in Columbia for their most recent foreign tour Harry and Meghan with member of the Muslim community in their new glossy video The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have spent recent months focussing on more solo charity and business ventures, rarely appearing together since their joint tour to Colombia over the summer. But despite reports of a 'professional separation', they are front and centre of a new behind-the-scenes video of Archewell's major moments of the past 12 months with Coldplay 's Sky Full of Stars as the soundtrack to the near-two minute film. It shows the couple together at a number of events as well as Meghan cooking with women plus footage of their trips across the US and abroad \u2013 mainly together and sometimes apart. This week the Archewell Foundation released its annual report, which reveals that the Sussexes' have partnered with US President Joe Biden 's daughter Ashley to create a wellness hub for women impacted by trauma in Philadelphia which pioneers a radical new type of therapy, giving a $250,000 donation. The charity's US tax return for 2023 has also been published, which reveals income has reached $5.7million last year, mainly thanks to a mystery benefactor who gave $5million in a single donation plus $335,000 from five other individuals. The Archewell Foundation handed out $1.3million in grants to good causes in the US and other parts of the world. Expenditure on other costs such as salaries, event costs, legal fees and travel was just under $2million in 2023. Harry and Meghan are directors but do not get paid a salary. The charity's tax return says they work a nominal one-hour-per-week, which according to People is 'a standard practice for directors of US tax-exempt organisations'. But the Sussexes' right-hand man James Holt, a co-executive director, was paid a $228,500 salary plus $18,428 in benefits from January to December 2023. Co-executive director Shauna Nep, who is also close to the royal couple, earned a salary of $272,241 plus additional benefits totaling $26,356. Communications manager Deesha Tank was paid $140,000 plus $7,100 in 'other compensation', according to the US tax filings. The new report reveals they paid $155,000 to Herlihy Loughran. The consultancy is run by Beth Herlihy, a former actress who once played a stripper in UK teen soap opera Hollyoaks and has been a loyal worker for the Sussexes after she was laid off by Kensington Palace following Megxit.

Harry and Meghan do not claim a salary On Wednesday Prince Harry used a New York media summit to challenge persistent online rumours that his marriage to Meghan Markle is on the rocks after six years. The Duke of Sussex was one of the star guests at the annual DealBook Summit live where he let rip at 'trolls', insisting he feels 'sorry' for them because they 'hope' they will split up. He also used the event, also attended by Jeff Bezos and Bill Clinton , to criticise Britain's legal system, Government, media and being in the public eye, declaring the attention was 'definitely not a good thing'. And Harry revealed he and wife have no plans to return to the UK - with their children at the heart of the decision - because Archie, five, and Lilibet, three can do things in America that they 'undoubtedly wouldn't be able to do in the UK'. With his wife Meghan 2,500 miles away at a gala event in Los Angeles with friend Tyler Perry , Harry was asked by the event's founder Andrew Ross Sorkin about the public's fixation on their relationship. 'They're fascinated Meghan is in California right now, and you're here. There are articles left and right about: 'Why are you making, doing independent events? Why aren't you doing them together?' The Duke of Sussex then dismissed claims that he and Meghan are struggling. 'Apparently we've bought or moved house 10, 12 times. We've apparently divorced maybe 10, 12 times as well. So it's just like, 'what?',' Harry said laughing. 'It's hard to keep up with, but that's why you just sort of ignore it. The people I feel most sorry about are the trolls. 'Their hopes are just built and built, and it's like, 'Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes', and then it doesn't happen. So I feel sorry for them. Genuinely, I do.' Prince Harry quashed rumours online that he and Meghan have 'apparently divorced maybe 10, 12 times', blaming trolls Prince Harry said that he and wife Meghan Markle have zero plans to leave the US, citing security concerns in the UK Meghan Markle attended an event in LA without Harry, who was in New York at the same time The couple, last pictured together on Armistice Day in November, have done an increasing amount of engagements separately in recent months Harry and Meghan chose to carry out events separately, amid repeated reports of a 'professional separation' to pursue more of their own personal business and charity passions . The Duchess of Sussex wowed in a strapless black Oscar de la Renta gown with a sizzling front slit and strappy Celine heels at the The Paley Honors gala in Beverly Hills, held at the iconic Beverly Wilshire Hotel. She grinned on the red carpet with friend Tyler Perry, one of the Sussexes' biggest supporters.
