                    "content": "Subscribe to our FREE Newsletter , or Telegram and WhatsApp channels for the latest stories and updates. Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim\u2019s recent consideration of granting Bumiputera status to Indian Muslims has sparked intense debate about the role of religion in determining economic privileges in Malaysia. The announcement, which affects approximately 1.1 million Indian Muslims, has drawn sharp criticism from various quarters. Social critic and writer Preeta Samarasan noted that this move merely confirms what many have long observed. Bumiputera policies are and have always been, among many other things, incentive for conversion to Islam. The criteria for Bumiputera status had raised eyebrows, particularly when Malaysian Muslim League president Najmudeen Kader cited \u201cassimilation into Malay culture\u201d as a qualification. However, critics argue the actual qualification is more straightforward: being Muslim. The policy implications are significant. Najmudeen himself acknowledged that non-bumiputeras face \u201cproblems relating to housing, business and university admissions\u201d \u2013 challenges that could potentially be resolved through religious conversion. For many observers, this development crystallizes a long-standing issue: the effective creation of different classes of citizens based primarily on religious identity rather than economic need or historical presence in the country. So org yg asalnya lahir di india dan kemudian jadi indian muslim pun boleh jadi bumiputera? Bodoh betul.. Prominent political analyst professor James Chin argues the move further deepens Malaysia\u2019s religious-economic divide. In his pointed critique, Chin emphasizes a lesser-known fact. Bumiputera is an administrative category rather than a Constitutional one \u2013 the word doesn\u2019t even appear in the Constitution . This revelation challenges common assumptions about the policy\u2019s legal foundations. He suggests a more inclusive alternative: extending Bumiputera status to all poor Malaysians, regardless of race or religion. However, Chin acknowledges the political constraints facing Anwar\u2019s administration. Chin proposes a radical idea: extend Bumiputera benefits to all poor Malaysians, regardless of faith or ethnicity. This solution could unite rather than divide. To be fair, Anwar has previously championed this approach, consistently advocating for assistance to all poor Malaysians regardless of race or religion. Kerajaan MADANI tidak menggunakan pendekatan kaum dalam menghapuskan miskin tegar. Sesiapa sahaja golongan miskin tegar dan mereka adalah rakyat negara ini, mereka wajib dibantu tanpa diskriminasi. #MalaysiaMADANI pic.twitter.com/GV0Xy3s5LP But in Malaysia\u2019s religion-charged political landscape, such reform remains a distant dream. \u201cI understand many Malays believe economic benefits and political power are birthrights,\u201d Chin notes, \u201cbut that\u2019s another issue.\u201d As Malaysia approaches its next general election, the question remains: Will the country ever move beyond its religious-economic divide? He quipped \u2013 making a lighthearted observation about historical ironies \u2013 that even Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia\u2019s longest-serving premier for 24 years, hadn\u2019t taken this step for Indian Muslims. bagi status bumiputera dkt india muslim sama seperti bagi status bumiputera dkt rohingya, baba nyonya lagi layak dapat status bumiputera sbb baba nyonya dah pasti ada darah campuran melayu chinese Parts of this story have been sourced from FMT .
