The said event, scheduled to take place from December 17 to 21, 2024 in Ghaziabad, is being organised by individuals who have a history of making hateful and inflammatory speeches against the Muslim community. The petition highlights that these speeches and the event itself promote hatred and could lead to communal violence.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court had earlier directed authorities to take immediate action against such hate speeches and events, even if no formal complaint was made. However, despite clear announcements about the \"Dharam Sansad\" and its harmful content being shared publicly, the authorities have failed to act. This petition calls for the Court to intervene and ensure that the law is enforced, so as to prevent any further spread of hate and violence.\\n\\nNot only through legal means, many religious organisations have also condemned the scheduled event. The Satya Dharam Samvad (SDS), a collective of 62 prominent Hindu Acharyas, has also spoken against the divisive nature of the proposed \"Dharam Sansad,\" calling for its rejection and emphasising the need for unity, tolerance, and interfaith dialogue. In a statement, they expressed concern over the misuse of religion to incite hatred and violence, reaffirming that Hinduism, with its core principles of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family) and Sarva Dharma Sambhava (equal respect for all religions), stands for peace, acceptance, and harmony.\\n\\nSatya Dharam Samvad condemns the \"Dharam Sansad\" and calls for unity\\n\\nThe Satya Dharam Samvad (SDS), an organisation of Hindu Acharyas, has called upon Hindu religious leaders and organisations to reject the divisive \"Dharam Sansad\" proposed by the Yati Narsinghanand Foundation, scheduled to take place from Tuesday to Saturday at the Shiv-Shakti temple complex in Ghaziabad\\'s Dasna. In a joint statement signed by 62 Acharyas, including prominent figures like Swami Raghavendra, Acharya Bajrang, Mahant, Prof. Anantanand Rambachan, Ashok Maharaj Kamble, and Ashok Sangpa, the SDS emphasised the importance of promoting unity, tolerance, and dialogue over hatred and division.\\n\\nThe statement expressed deep concern over the increasing misuse of religion to spread violence and discord, urging a return to the foundational values of Hinduism - Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family) and Sarva Dharma Sambhava (equal respect for all religions). It affirmed that Hinduism has always stood for peace, acceptance, and harmony, rejecting caste-based divisions and any form of oppression. True spirituality, the signatories asserted, lies in recognising the divine presence in all beings and fostering mutual respect.\\n\\nThe SDS also criticised the \"World Religion Convention\" and the provocative speeches targeting specific faiths that are being promoted as part of the upcoming event. These actions, they argued, are a departure from the true essence of Sanatan Dharma, undermining its spiritual sanctity while threatening the harmony of the nation. The statement firmly condemned words or actions that promote hatred, disrespect other religions, or incite violence, calling such behaviour completely at odds with Hindu principles.\\n\\nCalling for interfaith understanding and peaceful coexistence, the SDS urged religious leaders to oppose the exploitation of religion for political or divisive purposes. They also called on the authorities to take accountability and ensure that religion is not misused to fuel division. The signatories appealed for unity, urging Hindus and people of all faiths to come together with kindness and mutual respect, recognising that India\\'s true strength lies in its diversity and shared harmony.\\n\\nBackground: The petition had been filed before the Supreme Court of India under Article 129 of the Constitution, read with Section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. The petition arises from the deliberate and wilful disobedience of two specific orders passed by the Supreme Court: the order dated October 21, 2022 in Shaheen Abdulla v. Union of India & Ors. (W.P. (C) No. 940/2022) and the order dated April 28, 2023 in Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay v. Union of India & Ors. (W.P. (C) No. 943/2021). These orders had directed state authorities to take suo- motu action against hate speech or activities that attract offences under Sections 153A, 153B, 295A, and 505 of the erstwhile Indian Penal Code (IPC), even in the absence of formal complaints. The orders further clarified that any hesitation or delay in complying with these directions would amount to contempt of court.\\n\\nThe petition states that despite these explicit directives, the petition highlights that the authorities in Uttar Pradesh, including the Commissioner of Police, District Magistrate, and Director General of Police, have failed to act against an upcoming event titled \"Dharam Sansad,\" scheduled to take place from December 17 to 21 at Shiv Shakti Dham, Dasna, Ghaziabad. The event, organised by the Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati Foundation, has been widely publicised through a website titled worldreligiousconvention.org. The website and the event itself are rooted in incendiary, communal content that openly propagates hate against the Muslim community, posing a direct threat to constitutional values of secularism and fraternity. The contempt petition seeks immediate judicial intervention to prevent this event and hold the respondents accountable for their failure to comply with the Supreme Court\\'s earlier orders.\\n\\nThe content of the event and its communal nature: The petition brings to the Court\\'s attention the blatantly inflammatory and communal nature of the content being disseminated through the website promoting the \"Dharam Sansad\" event. The petition provides that the mission statement of the event openly declares:\\n\\n\"The World Religious Parliament is a meaningful initiative to warn the whole world about the danger of Islam and it is an effort to bring together every Non-Muslim of all over the countries.\"\\n\\nFurther, the petition also provides the vision statement that outlines an explicit and dangerous agenda:\\n\\n\"Our goal is to free the entire world from Islamic Jihad. This is our specific goal and to achieve this goal, we will take all possible steps.\"\\n\\nIn addition to the website\\'s content, the petition underscores that provocative and hateful language has been used in public speeches made by the event organisers, event as the announcement of the Dharam Sansad was being made. As per the petition, Yati Ramswaroopanand, one of the key figures associated with the event, delivered a speech in Dehradun on September 10, 2024, describing Muslims as \"not human\" and calling for Uttarakhand to be made \"Islam mukt.\" He further urged Hindus to \"keep good weapons and learn how to use them.\" The petition provides supporting material, including transcripts, screenshots, and reports, to substantiate these claims.\\n\\nThe petition emphasises that the dissemination of such incendiary content and the planned congregation of individuals with a documented history of hate speech is not only a violation of Sections 153A, 153B, 295A, and 505 of the IPC but also strikes at the core of India\\'s constitutional values of secularism, harmony, and fraternity.\\n\\nTrack record of violence and state inaction: The contempt petition goes beyond the immediate concern of the \"Dharam Sansad\" and highlights the troubling track record of the individuals involved in organising and promoting the event. Individuals like Yati Narsinghanand and Yati Ramswaroopanand have repeatedly made provocative speeches inciting communal violence. For instance:\\n\\nThe petition highlights that despite a well-documented history of hate speech and communal violence directly linked to these individuals, the state authorities have failed to take preventive action or register FIRs, as mandated by the Supreme Court. This consistent inaction emboldens the organisers and poses an imminent threat to communal harmony in the region.\\n\\nThe petition argues that the respondents\\' failure to act constitutes not just a dereliction of duty but a wilful disobedience of the Supreme Court\\'s orders. By ignoring repeated provocations and open announcements of such events, the state authorities are in clear contempt of court.\\n\\nLegal basis and prayer for relief: The petition places heavy reliance on two recent judgments of the Supreme Court to strengthen its legal argument. In Chaduranga Kanthraj URS v. P. Ravi Kumar (2024), the Court clarified that wilful disobedience -- deliberate and intentional disregard of court orders -- constitutes civil contempt. Similarly, in Celir LLP v. Sumati Prasad Bafna (2024), the Court expanded the scope of contempt, holding that any act intended to undermine the judicial process also falls within its ambit. The petition argues that the respondents\\' failure to prevent the \"Dharam Sansad\" event, despite its provocative and unconstitutional nature, directly undermines the Court\\'s authority and frustrates its earlier orders.\\n\\nThe petition concludes with the following prayers:\\n\\nThe petition emphasises that the Court\\'s intervention is not only necessary to address the specific case of non-compliance but also to reaffirm the rule of law and the constitutional mandate of secularism and fraternity. By allowing such events to proceed unchecked, the respondents are enabling the erosion of these values and endangering communal harmony across the nation. The petition, therefore, calls upon the Court to take strong and decisive action to ensure compliance with its earlier orders and prevent further escalation of hate speech and violence.\\n\\nA detailed report on the widespread opposition that the Dharam Sansad is facing can be read here.\\n\\nFierce backlash grows against Yati Narsinghanand\\'s Dharam Sansad as fears of incitement to violence escalate; plea moved in SC\\n\\nUttarakhand: Retd.

PM Modi underlined that we are not just a great democratic country but also the creators of democracy.\\n\\nQuoting Rajarshi Purushottam Das Tandon from the constitutional debates, the Prime Minister said: \"It is after centuries, such an eventful meeting is called for, which reminds me of our great past and the earlier times when we were independent and intellectuals used to discuss and deliberate meaningful issues in the sabhas.\"\\n\\nHe then quoted Dr. S. Radhakrishnan and said: \"The system of Republic is not a new idea for this great nation for we have had this system since the beginning of our history.\"\\n\\nHe then quoted Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar and said: \"It is not that India is aware of democracy, there was a time when there were multiple republics in India.\"\\n\\nThe Prime Minister lauded the role of women during the process of making the Constitution and also empowering it further.\\n\\nHe added that there were 15 respected and active members in the Constituent Assembly and they had further strengthened the process of drafting the Constitution by giving their original thoughts, views and ideas. Recalling that each one of them was from diverse backgrounds, PM Modi emphasised that the thoughtful suggestions given by the women members had a profound impact on the Constitution.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister also expressed pride that suffrage rights were given to women right from the time of independence as compared to many other countries of the world which took decades for the same.\\n\\nHe added that with the same spirit, India during its presidency of the G20 summit put forward the vision of women-led development in front of the world. PM Modi also noted the successful enactment of the Narishakti Vandan Adhiniyam by all the parliamentarians and added that the government had taken steps to ensure increased political participation of women.\\n\\nPM Modi emphasised that at the core of every major policy decision is women and expressed happiness that it was a great coincidence that during the completion of 75 years of the Constitution, the post of President of India was held by a tribal woman.\\n\\nHe added that it was a true expression of the spirit of our constitution.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister highlighted that the representation and the contribution of women is constantly increasing in the Parliament as well as in the Council of Ministers.\\n\\n\"The representation and contribution of women, be it in the field of social, political, education, sports or any other, has been bringing pride to the country,\" said PM Modi and that every Indian was proud of women\\'s contributions in the field of science and technology, especially in the space sector.\\n\\nHe added that the Constitution was the greatest inspiration for this.\\n\\nReiterating that India was progressing rapidly, PM Modi remarked that soon India would be the third-largest economy in the world.\\n\\nHe added that it was the combined resolve of 140 crore Indians to ensure that India is developed by 2047. He further added that the unity of India was the most important necessity for this resolution to be achieved.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister noted that our Constitution is also the foundation of the unity of India.\\n\\nRecalling that the process of framing the Constitution comprised great freedom fighters, authors, thinkers, social activists, educationists and professionals from other diverse fields, PM Modi said that all of them were highly sensitive of the fact of unity of India.\\n\\nPM Modi expressed dissatisfaction, stating that post-independence, the framers of the Constitution had unity in their hearts and minds. However, after independence, due to distorted mentalities or selfishness, the greatest blow was dealt to the core spirit of the nation\\'s unity.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister highlighted that unity in diversity has been India\\'s hallmark and emphasised that we celebrate diversity, and the country\\'s progress lies in celebrating this diversity. However, those with a colonial mindset, who could not see the good in India, and those who believed India was born in 1947, sought contradictions in this diversity.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister remarked that instead of celebrating this invaluable treasure of diversity, efforts were made to sow poisonous seeds within it, aiming to harm the nation\\'s unity.\\n\\nPM Modi urged everyone to make the celebration of diversity an integral part of our lives, and that will be a true tribute to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister highlighted that over the past 10 years, the government\\'s policies have consistently aimed to strengthen the unity of India. He added that Article 370 was an obstacle to the nation\\'s unity and acted as a barrier. PM Modi emphasised that the unity of the country was a priority, in line with the spirit of the Constitution, and hence, Article 370 was abrogated.\\n\\nPM Modi emphasised the need for favourable conditions in India to advance economically and attract global investment. He added that discussions on GST had been ongoing for a long time in the country.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister remarked that GST has played a significant role in economic unity acknowledged the contributions of the previous government and noted that the current government had the opportunity to implement it, advancing the concept of \"One Nation, One Tax\".\\n\\nTouching upon the importance of how ration cards have been a valuable document for the poor in our country and the difficulties encountered by a poor person when he/she moved from one state to another, PM Modi said that they were not entitled to any benefits.\\n\\nHe emphasised that every citizen should have equal rights, regardless of where they are in this vast country and added that to strengthen this sense of unity, the government had reinforced the concept of \"One Nation, One Ration Card\".\\n\\nThe Prime Minister emphasised that providing free healthcare to the poor and common citizens significantly enhances their ability to fight poverty. He highlighted that while healthcare is accessible where they work, it should also be available when they are away and facing life-threatening situations. He remarked that to uphold the principle of national unity, the government introduced the \"One Nation, One Health Card\" initiative through Ayushman Bharat.\\n\\nHe noted that even a person from a remote area of Bihar working in Pune can receive necessary medical services with an Ayushman card.\\n\\nPM Modi highlighted that there were times when one part of the country had electricity while another part was in darkness due to supply issues. He said that during the tenure of the previous governments, India was often criticised globally for its power shortages. The Prime Minister emphasised that to uphold the spirit of the Constitution and the mantra of unity, the government implemented the \"One Nation, One Grid\" initiative. He noted that today, electricity can be seamlessly supplied to every corner of India.\\n\\nTouching upon the infrastructure development in the country, the Prime Minister emphasised that the government is focusing on balanced development to strengthen national unity. He added that whether it is the North East, Jammu and Kashmir, the Himalayan regions, or the desert areas, the government has undertaken efforts to empower infrastructure comprehensively. He noted that this initiative aims to eliminate any sense of distance due to lack of development, thereby fostering unity.\\n\\nEmphasising the digital divide between the \"haves\" and \"have-nots\", PM Modi highlighted that India\\'s success story in Digital India is a source of great pride globally. He added that the democratisation of technology has been a key factor in this success. PM Modi remarked that guided by the vision of the framers of the Constitution, the government has worked to extend optical fibre to every panchayat in India to strengthen national unity.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister said that the Constitution expects unity, and in this spirit, the importance of the mother tongue has been recognised. He noted that suppressing the mother tongue cannot culturally enrich the nation\\'s populace. PM Modi remarked that the New Education Policy has given significant importance to the mother tongue, enabling even the poorest children to become doctors and engineers in their native languages. He added that the Constitution supports everyone and mandates addressing their needs. He highlighted that several classical languages were given their rightful place and respect. He mentioned that the \"Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat\" campaign is strengthening national unity and instilling cultural values in the new generation.\\n\\nHighlighting that the Kashi Tamil Sangamam and Telugu Kashi Sangamam have become significant institutionalised events, PM Modi emphasised that these cultural initiatives strengthen societal bonds. He added that the importance of India\\'s unity is recognised in the core principles of the Constitution, and this should be acknowledged.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister remarked while the Constitution is celebrating its 75th anniversary, milestones like 25, 50, and 60 years also hold significance. Reflecting on history, he said that during the 25th anniversary of the Constitution, it was torn apart in the country. The Prime Minister highlighted that the Emergency was imposed, constitutional arrangements were dismantled, the country was turned into a prison, citizens\\' rights were snatched, and press freedom was locked down.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister said that democracy was strangled, and the sacrifices of the Constitution\\'s framers were attempted to be buried.\\n\\nPM Modi noted that under the leadership of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the nation celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Constitution on November 26, 2000. The Prime Minister said that Atal Bihari Vajpayee, as Prime Minister, delivered a special message to the nation, emphasising the importance of unity, public participation, and partnership. He noted that former PM Vajpayee\\'s efforts were aimed at living the spirit of the Constitution and awakening the public.\\n\\nPrime Minister Modi said that during the 50th anniversary of the Constitution, he had the privilege of becoming the Chief Minister through the constitutional process. He highlighted that during his tenure as Chief Minister, the 60th anniversary of the Constitution was celebrated in Gujarat. He added that for the first time in history, the Constitution was placed in a special arrangement on an elephant, and a Constitution Gaurav Yatra was conducted. PM Modi emphasised that the Constitution holds great significance, and today, as it completes 75 years, he recalled an incident in the Lok Sabha where a senior leader questioned the need for celebrating Constitution Day on November 26, given that January 26 already existed.\\n\\nPM Modi expressed happiness about the special session, noting that it would have been beneficial to discuss the power and diversity of the Constitution, which would have been valuable for the new generation. However, he remarked that everyone had their own constraints, and their own misgivings in various forms, with some revealing their failures. The Prime Minister emphasised that it would have been better if discussions had risen above partisan sentiments and focused on the national interest, which would have enriched the new generation.\\n\\nThe PM expressed special respect for the Constitution, stating that it was the spirit of the Constitution that enabled many people like him to reach where they are today. He highlighted that without any background, it was the power of the Constitution and the blessings of the people that brought them here. PM Modi noted that many individuals in similar situations have reached significant positions because of the Constitution. He added that it is a great fortune that the country has shown immense faith, not just once, but three times. He remarked that this would not have been possible without the Constitution.\\n\\nPM Modi noted that from 1947 to 1952, India did not have an elected government but a temporary, selected one, with no elections held. He highlighted that before 1952, the Rajya Sabha was not formed, and there were no state elections, meaning there was no mandate from the people. He added that despite this, in 1951, without an elected government, an ordinance was issued to amend the Constitution, attacking freedom of expression. The Prime Minister emphasised that this was an insult to the Constitution\\'s framers, as such matters were not addressed in the Constituent Assembly. He remarked that when the opportunity arose, they hammered down on freedom of expression, which was a grave insult to the Constitution\\'s creators. The Prime Minister said that what could not be achieved in the Constituent Assembly was done through the back door by a non-elected Prime Minister, which was a sin.\\n\\nThe PM highlighted that in 1971, a Supreme Court decision was overturned by amending the Constitution, clipping the wings of the judiciary. PM Modi noted that the amendment stated that Parliament could alter any article of the Constitution without judicial review, stripping the courts of their powers. He added that this enabled the then government to curtail fundamental rights and control the judiciary.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister noted that during the Emergency, the Constitution was misused, and democracy was strangled. He emphasised that in 1975, the 39th Amendment was passed, preventing any court from challenging the elections of the President, Vice President, Prime Minister, and Speaker, and this was applied retrospectively to cover past actions.\\n\\nFurther deliberating that during the Emergency, PM Modi noted that people\\'s rights were taken away, thousands were imprisoned, the judiciary was strangled, and press freedom was locked down. He remarked that the idea of a committed judiciary was fully enforced. The Prime Minister noted that Justice H.R. Khanna, who had ruled against the then Prime Minister in a court case, was denied the position of Chief Justice of India despite his seniority. He emphasised that this was a violation of constitutional and democratic processes.\\n\\nRecalling the Supreme Court\\'s judgment in the Shah Bano case provided justice to an Indian woman based on the Constitution\\'s dignity and spirit, PM Modi noted that the Supreme Court granted an elderly woman her rightful due, but then-Prime Minister negated this spirit, sacrificing the Constitution\\'s essence. The Prime Minister remarked that Parliament passed a law to overturn the Supreme Court\\'s decision once again.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister remarked that for the first time in history, the Constitution was deeply wounded.\\n\\nHe added that the framers of the Constitution envisioned an elected government and Prime Minister. However, a non-constitutional entity, the National Advisory Council, which did not take any oath, was placed above the Prime Minister\\'s Office (PMO). The Prime Minister noted that this entity was given an unofficial status above the PMO.\\n\\nPM Modi highlighted that under the Indian Constitution, the people elect the government, and the head of that government forms the Cabinet.\\n\\nRecollecting an incident when a decision made by the Cabinet was torn up in front of journalists by arrogant individuals who disrespected the Constitution, PM Modi said that these individuals habitually played with the Constitution and did not respect it. He added that it was unfortunate that the Cabinet would then change its decision.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister noted that while Article 370 is well-known, very few are aware of Article 35A. He emphasised that Article 35A was imposed without parliamentary approval, which should have been sought. The Prime Minister remarked that the Parliament, the primary guardian of the Constitution, was bypassed, and Article 35A was imposed on the country, leading to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. He highlighted that this was done through a Presidential order, keeping the Parliament in the dark.\\n\\n\\\\PM Modi noted that during Atal Bihari Vajpayee\\'s government, it was decided to build a memorial in Dr. Ambedkar\\'s memory but this work was neither initiated nor allowed for the next 10 years. The Prime Minister emphasised that when his government came to power, out of respect for Dr Ambedkar, they constructed the Dr Ambedkar Memorial on Alipur Road and completed the work.\\n\\nRecollecting that in 1992, during the tenure of former PM Chandra Shekhar, it was decided to establish the Ambedkar International Centre near Janpath in Delhi, PM Modi said this project remained on paper for 40 years and was not executed. He highlighted that it was only in 2015, when his government came to power, that the work was completed. The Prime Minister noted that even the awarding of the Bharat Ratna to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was done a long time later after independence.\\n\\nPM Modi underlined that the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was celebrated globally in 120 countries and during Dr. Ambedkar\\'s birth centenary, a memorial was reconstructed in Mhow, Ambedkar\\'s birthplace.\\n\\nLauding Dr B.R. Ambedkar, a visionary committed to bringing the marginalised sections of society into the mainstream, PM Modi remarked that Dr. Ambedkar believed that for India to develop, no part of the country should remain weak.\\n\\nHe added that this concern led to the establishment of the reservation system. The Prime Minister noted that those engaged in vote bank politics attempted to introduce various measures under the guise of religious appeasement within the reservation system, causing significant harm to the SC, ST, and OBC communities.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister remarked that the previous governments strongly opposed reservations and emphasised that Dr. B.R. Ambedkar introduced reservations for equality and balanced development in India. The Prime Minister remarked that the Mandal Commission report was shelved for decades leading to delays in the reservation for OBCs. The Prime Minister noted that if reservations had been granted earlier, many OBC individuals would be serving in various positions today.\\n\\nTouching upon the extensive discussions on whether reservations should be based on religion during the drafting of the Constitution, PM Modi said that the constitution framers concluded that for the unity and integrity of a country like India, reservations based on religion or community were not feasible.\\n\\nHe added that it was a well-considered decision, not an oversight. PM Modi remarked that the previous governments introduced reservations based on religion, which goes against the spirit of the Constitution. He noted that despite some implementations, the Supreme Court has struck down such measures.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister said that it is clear that there is an intention to provide reservations based on religion, which is a shameless attempt to hurt the sentiments of the Constitution\\'s framers.\\n\\nDiscussing the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) as a burning issue which was not overlooked by the Constituent Assembly, the PM said that the Constituent Assembly engaged in extensive discussions on the UCC and decided that it would be best for the elected government to implement it. He added that this was the directive of the Constituent Assembly. The Prime Minister remarked that Dr Ambedkar advocated for the UCC, and his words should not be misrepresented.\\n\\nPM Modi highlighted that Dr. B.R. Ambedkar strongly advocated for the abolition of personal laws based on religion. Quoting K.M. Munshi, a member of the Constituent Assembly, who stated that a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) is essential for national unity and modernity, PM Modi said that the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized the need for a UCC and has directed governments to implement it as soon as possible. He emphasised that, in keeping with the spirit of the Constitution and the intentions of its framers, the government is fully committed to establishing a secular civil code.\\n\\nReciting an incident of the past, the Prime Minister questioned how those who do not respect their own party\\'s constitution can respect the country\\'s Constitution.\\n\\nPM Modi noted that in 1996, the BJP emerged as the largest party, and the President, respecting the Constitution, invited them to form the government. However, the government lasted only 13 days because they chose to honour the Constitution. He emphasised that former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee did not opt for bargaining but respected the Constitution and resigned after 13 days.\\n\\nHe added that in 1998, the NDA government faced instability, but former PM Vajpayee\\'s government, dedicated to the spirit of the Constitution, preferred to lose by one vote and resign rather than accept unconstitutional positions. He emphasised that this is their history, values, and tradition. On the other hand, he noted that during the cash-for-votes scandal, money was used to save a minority government, turning the spirit of Indian democracy into a marketplace where votes were bought.\\n\\nPM Modi remarked that after 2014, the NDA got the opportunity to serve, strengthening the Constitution and democracy. He highlighted that they launched a campaign to rid the country of old ailments. The Prime Minister noted that over the past 10 years, they had also made constitutional amendments, for the unity and integrity of the country, for its bright future, and with full dedication to the spirit of the Constitution.\\n\\nThe PM remarked that the OBC community had been demanding constitutional status for the OBC Commission for three decades. He highlighted that they amended the Constitution to grant this status, taking pride in doing so. The Prime Minister emphasised that standing with the marginalised sections of society is their duty, which is why the constitutional amendment was made.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister underscored that there was a large section of society that, regardless of caste, could not access opportunities due to poverty and could not progress.\\n\\nNoting that this dissatisfaction was growing, and despite demands, no decisions were made, PM Modi said that his government amended the Constitution to provide 10 per cent reservation for economically weaker sections of the general category. He emphasised that this was the first reservation amendment in the country that faced no opposition, was accepted with love by everyone, and was passed unanimously by Parliament. The Prime Minister remarked that this was because it strengthened social unity and aligned with the spirit of the Constitution.\\n\\nPM Modi highlighted that they have also made constitutional amendments, but these were to empower women. He added that his government amended the Constitution for the unity of the country. PM Modi highlighted that Dr B.R. Ambedkar\\'s Constitution could not fully apply to Jammu and Kashmir due to Article 370, while the government wanted Ambedkar\\'s Constitution to be implemented in every part of India. He added that they amended the Constitution to strengthen national unity and to pay tribute to Dr Ambedkar. The Prime Minister said his government removed Article 370, and now the Supreme Court has also upheld this decision.\\n\\nTouching upon the amendment of the Constitution to remove Article 370, PM Modi highlighted that his government also enacted laws to fulfill the promise made by Mahatma Gandhi and other senior leaders at the time of partition, to care for minorities in neighbouring countries during times of crisis. He emphasised that his government introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) to honour this commitment and said that it proudly stands by this law, as it aligns with the spirit of the Constitution and strengthens the nation.\\n\\nPM Modi remarked that the constitutional amendments made by his government were aimed at correcting past mistakes and paving the way for a brighter future. He highlighted that time will tell if they stand the test of time. The Prime Minister emphasised that these amendments were not driven by selfish power interests but were acts of virtue for the nation\\'s benefit. He noted that this is why his government confidently addressed any questions raised.\\n\\nNoting that numerous speeches and topics have been raised regarding the Constitution, each with its own political motivations, the PM said that the Constitution is most sensitive to the people of India, \"We the People,\" and is meant for their welfare, dignity, and well-being. He noted that the Constitution guides us towards a welfare state, ensuring a dignified life for all citizens.\\n\\nHighlighting that after so many years of independence, many families did not have access to a toilet to live with dignity, PM Modi said that the campaign to build toilets was a dream for the poor, and they took it up with full dedication. He added that despite being mocked, they remained steadfast because the dignity of ordinary citizens was their priority. The PM emphasised that women had to go for open defecation either before sunrise or after sunset, and this did not bother those who only saw the poor on TV or in newspaper headlines. The Prime Minister remarked that those who do not understand the life of the poor would not commit such injustices. PM Modi questioned that eighty per cent of the people in this country were deprived of clean drinking water, despite the Constitution\\'s aim to ensure basic human amenities for everyone.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister remarked that millions of mothers in the country used to cook on traditional stoves, causing their eyes to turn red from the smoke, which was equivalent to inhaling the smoke of hundreds of cigarettes. He highlighted that this not only affected their eyes but also deteriorated their health. PM Modi said that even after 70 years of independence until 2013, the discussion was about whether to provide nine or six cylinders, while his government ensured the delivery of gas cylinders to every household because they prioritised providing basic amenities to every citizen.\\n\\nDiscussing the healthcare sector, PM Modi said that a single illness can ruin a poor family who works hard day and night to escape poverty and educate their children, their plans and efforts. He highlighted that they implemented the Ayushman Bharat scheme to provide free treatment to 50-60 crore citizens, respecting the spirit of the Constitution. The Prime Minister noted that this scheme ensures healthcare for all, including those above 70 years of age, from any section of society.\\n\\nTouching upon the free ration provided to the poor, PM Modi highlighted that 25 crore people have successfully overcome poverty. He added that only those who have emerged from poverty understand the importance of support. He highlighted that just as a patient is advised to take care after being discharged from the hospital to avoid relapse, it is essential to support the poor to prevent them from falling back into poverty. The Prime Minister noted that this is why they provide free ration, to ensure that those who have been lifted out of poverty do not return to it, and to help those still in poverty to rise above it. He emphasised that mocking this effort is unjust, as it is crucial for maintaining the dignity and well-being of the citizens.\\n\\nRemarking that only slogans were made in the name of the poor, and banks were nationalised in their name, PM Modi highlighted that until 2014, 50 crore citizens in the country had never seen the inside of a bank. He added that they had opened bank accounts for 50 crore poor citizens, thus opening the doors of banks for them. The Prime Minister noted that a former Prime Minister once said that out of Rs 1 sent from Delhi, only 15 paise reached the poor. He emphasised that they have shown the way by ensuring that today, out of Rs 1 sent from Delhi, all 100 paise are deposited directly into the accounts of the poor. The Prime Minister said that his government has demonstrated the proper use of banks. He added that those who were previously not allowed to even approach the doors of banks can now avail loans without any guarantee. He highlighted that this empowerment of the poor is a testament to the government\\'s dedication to the Constitution.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister noted that the slogan \"Garibi Hatao\" (eradicate poverty) remained just a slogan because the poor were not freed from their difficulties. He emphasised that his government\\'s mission and commitment are to liberate the poor from these hardships, and they are working day and night to achieve this. The Prime Minister remarked that he stands for those who have no one to support them.\\n\\nTouching upon the struggles encountered by differently-abled citizens, PM Modi said that they have now provided accessible infrastructure for differently-abled individuals, allowing their wheelchairs to reach train compartments. He added that this initiative was driven by their concern for the marginalised sections of society. He emphasised that while disputes over language were taught, great injustice was done to differently-abled individuals. The Prime Minister remarked that sign language systems varied across states, causing difficulties for the differently-abled. He highlighted that his government has created a common sign language, which is now benefiting all differently-abled individuals in the country.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister said that the nomadic and semi-nomadic communities had no one to look after their welfare. He added that his government established a welfare board for their well-being, as these people are a priority under the Constitution. The Prime Minister noted that street vendors, who work tirelessly from morning to night, often face hardships, including renting their carts and borrowing money at high interest rates. He emphasised that the government introduced the PM SVANidhi scheme to provide collateral-free loans to street vendors. The Prime Minister remarked that due to this scheme, street vendors have reached the third round of loans, gaining respect and expanding their businesses.\\n\\nNoting that there is no one in this country who does not need the services of Vishwakarma artisans, PM Modi highlighted that a significant system had been in place for centuries, but the welfare of Vishwakarma artisans was never addressed. The Prime Minister noted that they have created a plan for the welfare of Vishwakarma artisans, including provisions for bank loans, new training, modern tools, and innovative designs. He emphasised that his government has strengthened this initiative to support the Vishwakarma community.\\n\\nPM Modi highlighted that the government had ensured rights for transgender individuals under the Indian Constitution and has enacted laws to protect their rights and provide them with a dignified life.\\n\\nRecalling during his stint as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, there was not a single science stream school in the entire tribal belt from Umargam to Ambaji, the Prime Minister noted that without science stream schools, tribal students couldn\\'t become engineers or doctors. He emphasised that they established science stream schools and universities in the area, addressing the educational needs of the tribal community.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister expressed gratitude to the President for guidance in creating the PM Jan Man Yojana, which focuses on the development of the most backward tribal communities. He highlighted that these small groups, often overlooked in vote politics, have now received attention and support through this scheme. The Prime Minister remarked that he is committed to finding and supporting even the most marginalised individuals.\\n\\nPM Modi noted that over 60 years, 100 districts were identified as backward, and this label became a punishment posting for responsible officers. He emphasised that his government changed this situation by introducing the concept of Aspirational Districts, regularly monitoring 40 parameters online. The Prime Minister said that today, Aspirational Districts are matching the best districts in their states and some are even reaching the national average. He highlighted that no region should be left behind, and they are now focusing on developing 500 blocks as Aspirational Blocks.\\n\\nHighlighting that the tribal community existed during the times of Ram and Krishna, yet no separate ministry was created for them even after decades of independence, the Prime Minister noted that it was the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee that first established a separate Ministry for tribal affairs and allocated a budget for their development and expansion. Speaking on the welfare of the fishermen, PM Modi said that for the first time, their government created a separate ministry of fisheries and a separate budget was given for their welfare. He said care was taken of this section of the society.\\n\\nConcerning the small farmers of the country, the Prime Minister remarked that cooperation is an important part of their lives. Highlighting concerns of small farmers, he said a separate cooperative ministry was created to give strength to the life of the small farmer by making the cooperative sector responsible, strong and empowering. Emphasising the importance of a skilled workforce, PM Modi said the whole world is yearning for a workforce today. He said if we want to get a demographic dividend in the country, then this workforce of ours should be skilled. He added that a separate skill ministry was created so that the youth of the country are prepared according to the needs of the world and they move forward with the world.\\n\\nTalking about the North-East, the Prime Minister said our North-East was neglected due to fewer votes or seats there. He said it was former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee\\'s government which for the first time made the DONER Ministry for the welfare of the North-East and today because of it one can see the development of the North-East in the building of railways, roads, ports and airports.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister underlined the importance of land records and problems faced therein even today in the most prosperous of countries. He said all efforts were made by the government to provide for ownership of the lands, so that every common man in the village has the land records of his house, the ownership papers of his house so that loans from the bank can be taken and there is no fear of illegal occupation.\\n\\nPM Modi said due to all these works, the efforts made in the last 10 years have strengthened the poor with new self-confidence and in such a short time 25 crore people have been successful in defeating poverty. He said all this could be possible because his government is working under the direction of the constitution.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister said \"Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\", is not a mere slogan, It is our article of faith and hence we have implemented government schemes without discrimination. He said the government is striving for saturation of schemes so that 100 per cent of the beneficiaries get the benefit. He added that if there is any true secularism then it is in saturation and if there is any true social justice then this saturation, that is the 100 per cent benefit should be given to the person who is entitled to it, without any discrimination. He said this is true secularism and true social justice.\\n\\nSpeaking about the spirit of the Constitution as the medium to give direction to the country, the Prime Minister said politics is at the centre as the driving force of the country. He said we should think about what should be the direction of our democracy, and our politics in the coming decades.\\n\\nPM Modi questioned some parties about their political selfishness and sense of power and whether they ever thought about it themselves and said that he meant this for all the parties. He said these are the thoughts of his mind that he wanted to put before this House.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister emphasised that all political parties should make efforts to attract the youth of the country, to strengthen the democracy and to bring the youth of the country forward. He said bringing youth into politics is the need of the country\\'s democracy and reiterated that one lakh such youth should be brought into the country\\'s politics, who do not have any political family background. He said the country needs new energy and young people who come with new resolutions and dreams and when we are celebrating 75 years of the Constitution of India we should move ahead in that direction.\\n\\nRecalling his words about our duties in the Constitution from the Red Fort, PM Modi said it was unfortunate that it was not understood that while the Constitution has determined the rights of the citizens it also expects duties from them. He said the essence of our civilisation is Dharma, our Duty, Quoting Mahatma Gandhi ji he said that Mahatma ji had said that he had learnt from his uneducated but learned mother that the rights emerge from how we perform our duties.\\n\\nPM Modi said he would like to take Mahatma ji\\'s words forward and say that if we follow our fundamental duties then no one can stop us from making a developed India. He said that 75 years of the Constitution should give more strength to our dedication towards duty, our commitment and the need of the hour is that the country should move forward with a sense of duty.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister said that inspired by the spirit of the Constitution for the future of India he wanted to place 11 resolutions before the House. The first resolution is that whether it is a citizen or the government, everyone should perform their duties. The second resolution is that every sector and every society should get the benefit of development, Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas. The third resolution is that there should be zero tolerance towards corruption, there should be no social acceptance of the corrupt. The fourth resolution is that the citizens of the country should take pride in following the laws of the country, the rules of the country, and the traditions of the country. The fifth resolution is to get rid of the mentality of slavery, there should be pride in the heritage of the country. The sixth resolution is that the politics of the country should be freed from nepotism. Seventh resolution, the constitution should be respected, the constitution should not be used as a weapon for political gain. Eighth resolution, in keeping the spirit of the constitution, reservation should not be snatched from those who are getting it and every attempt to give reservation based on religion should be stopped. Ninth resolution, India should become an example for the world in women-led development. The tenth resolution is the development of the nation through the development of the state, which should be our mantra of development. Eleventh resolution, the aim of \"Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat\" should be paramount.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister said that if we all move forward together with this resolution then with everyone\\'s efforts, We the people, can fulfil the dream of a developed India.\\n\\nHe said when the dream of 140 crore countrymen is fulfilled and the country starts moving with the resolution, then it brings the desired results.\\n\\nPM Modi said he had immense respect for 140 crore countrymen and faith in their strength, he had immense faith in the youth power of the country, in the women power of the country.\\n\\nConcluding his remarks the Prime Minister said that we should move forward with the resolve that when the country celebrates 100 years of independence in 2047, it will be celebrated as Viksit Bharat.\\n\\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor'}\n",

At the conference, Emilie Kao, the group\\'s senior counsel and vice president of advocacy strategy, took the floor to express her outrage that a Finnish doctor was put on trial for referring to homosexuality as \"a developmental disorder,\" \"a shame and a sin\" and as a form of \"genetic degeneration.\"\\n\\n\"Thank God she was unanimously acquitted,\" said Kao.\\n\\nAustin Ruse, president of the Center for Family and Human Rights (otherwise known as C-Fam), who has supported laws that would criminalise homosexual behaviour and has also said that hard left people that run modern universities should be \"taken out and shot,\" spoke about some of his group\\'s recent accomplishments. \"There is no redefinition of the family because we stopped them. Sexual orientation and gender identity has never become a category of nondiscrimination in international law, because we have stopped them,\" he said.\\n\\nKao, C-Fam and ADF did not respond to requests for comment. Ruse disputed that he called for the criminalization of gay sex, saying that he was only offering \"a hypothetical.\" He added that he has \"never advocated that anyone be taken out and shot.\"\\n\\nThe access and influence of these anti-LGBTQIA+ groups inside the UN isn\\'t limited to this summit. Both hold what\\'s known as Special Consultative status at the UN. And they\\'re not the only ones.\\n\\nIn a months-long investigation, Uncloseted Media found that at least six Southern Poverty Law Center-designated anti-LGBTQIA+ hate groups hold this coveted status, which is granted by the UN\\'s Economic and Social Council.\\n\\n\"What\\'s astounding is I\\'m not sure anybody\\'s ever produced a list,\" says Heidi Beirich, who oversaw SPLC\\'s annual designation of hate groups from 2012 to 2019. \"These organisations have been stealthily inserting themselves into bodies whose beliefs they don\\'t share for years,\" she says.\\n\\n\"Many of these organisations don\\'t even believe in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\" she says.\\n\\nSpecial Consultative Status -- which is held by more than 5000 groups -- gives members unique access to the UN and its subsidiary bodies, to the various human rights mechanisms of the organisation and to special events organised by the President of the General Assembly.\\n\\nThe UN did not respond to repeated interview requests as well as requests for comment.\\n\\n\"You have access to member states, right? So I think the danger of all of this is access to the members who make decisions on resolutions. Who make UN policy,\" says Gillian Kane, director of global policy and research at Ipas, a non-governmental organisation that focuses on advancing gender equity and reducing the harm of U.S. foreign policy.\\n\\nKane, who attended the November Summit, says this status \"legitimises these groups\" who have clear track records that conflict with the core principles of the UN, like the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing subtle about what they do. They hate gays and they\\'re unapologetic to go after it,\" says Kane.\\n\\nMany of these groups have been around for decades, advocating against the LGBTQIA+ community. Kao\\'s group, ADF, published a press release titled \"ADF increases global impact with new status at United Nations\" when they were granted consultative status in 2010. \"ADF can now have a say when UN treaties and conventions are drafted that directly impact religious liberty and important matters related to the sanctity of life, marriage, and the family,\" the release said. It goes on to say that \"ADF will now be able to monitor and provide input on matters\" affecting religious freedoms.\\n\\nThe group, which consists of hundreds of lawyers in the U.S. and around the globe, was founded in 1994 by Alan Sears, who co-authored The Homosexual Agenda: Exposing the Principal Threat to Religious Freedom Today. Since then, they have advocated at the state and federal level for laws that promote conversion therapy and that would ban gays from serving in the military. In addition, they\\'ve testified in favour of laws that would strip transgender folks of the right to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity, that would prevent them from changing the name on their birth certificate and that would ban their access to gender affirming healthcare.\\n\\nIn addition, they have been effective globally through their international arm, ADF International. In 2012 in Jamaica, they advocated for the retention of a a law that criminalises gay sex. That law remains in effect. And in 2013, members of ADF worked to defend a Belize statute that makes anyone engaging in LGBTQIA+ sex subject to a punishment of up to 10 years in prison.\\n\\nThe other groups -- which include the Howard Center for Family Religion and Society (now known as International Organization for Family), Family Research Council, the Association of United Families International and the American Family Association of New York -- all have similar track records.\\n\\nSubscribe now\\n\\nFamily Research Council has advocated in favor of conversion therapy laws and continues to publish articles that falsely assert that \"sexual orientation change efforts\" are effective for gay people. And Tim Wildmon, the President of the American Family Association, is currently advocating for a boycott of Target for allowing trans people to use the bathroom or dressing room that matches their gender identity.\\n\\n\"Please use #BoycottTarget,\" Wildmon wrote in a special update on their website.\\n\\nBecause of these track records, Beirich felt it was \"a no brainer\" to add them to the SPLC\\'s list of hate groups alongside the Ku Klux Klan, the American Defense Skinheads and Aryan Nations.\\n\\n\"We put them on the hate list because they demonise the entire LGBTQIA+ population in derogatory, dehumanising language, just like the Klan would with Black people or Jewish people,\" says Beirich, now the co-founder and chief strategy officer at the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.\\n\\n\"People in the Christian right who have long demonised the LGBTQIA+ community have political power in this country, and it\\'s more normalised to hate queer people than to hate Black people for no damn good reason. Which is what we\\'re talking about. So it\\'s the biblically informed aspect of it that somehow legitimises it,\" says Beirich, who adds that she has \"absolutely no idea\" how these groups secured this status.\\n\\nSo how do these groups get here? While they all conform to basic principles required for Special Consultative Status, such as being a registered nonprofit and having specialised expertise on issues relevant to the UN, they are also expected to act in conformity with \"the spirit, purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,\" which specifically states that members must promote and encourage respect for human rights, take action \"to strengthen universal peace\" and -- specifically for members with consultative status -- must promote policies that encourage \"social progress.\"\\n\\nNeil Datta, the executive director for the European Parliamentary Forum for Sexual and Reproductive Rights, says part of the reason these groups are granted this status is due to overworked civil servants who work for the NGO Branch of the UN and are in charge of a preliminary screening of these applicants.\\n\\n\"The folks reviewing these applications are not necessarily thematic experts on anything. So they\\'re tasked with a very dry job of processing different applications that come in, and very legitimately won\\'t know what all of these different groups are,\" he says. \"Imagine you had 15 climate groups applying and one didn\\'t believe in climate change. It\\'s not necessarily that easy to understand.\"\\n\\nDatta says it can be even harder to identify anti-LGBTQIA+ groups because they often operate under the guise of protecting the family or the rights of the child.\\n\\n\"These groups have very nice names that aren\\'t obviously anti-LGBTQIA+. And so the people reviewing these applications may not be able to pick up on some of the subtleties,\" he says.\\n\\nIn addition, Datta says these groups use \"very clever vocabulary\" that sounds well meaning. But really, they are weaponising this language to penetrate powerful institutions like the UN \"In reality, they\\'re using religious freedom as a fig leaf for hate speech.\"\\n\\n\"But if you know your Catholic social doctrine, then you will recognise [this vocabulary] immediately.\" Datta says common dog whistles such as \"common good\" or \"human dignity\" and \"in favour of life [or] of the family\" are used almost exclusively to limit the human rights of others, \"usually in sexuality and reproduction.\"\\n\\nDatta says these \"codewords\" are another reason these groups go unnoticed within the UN. For example, during a three hour meeting at the November Transatlantic Summit event, participants used the term \"human dignity\" over 30 times.\\n\\nAfter they get through the preliminary screening by UN civil servants, their application is reviewed by the NGO Committee -- which meets twice a year -- to decide who they will recommend for Special Consultative Status. After review, the recommended organisations are presented to ECOSOC for their final decision.\\n\\nThis committee includes 19 countries, including multiple countries that have extremely hostile policies against LGBTQIA+ people, like Algeria, where homosexual activity is punishable by up to two years in prison; and Eritrea, where homosexuality is illegal and can be punished with jail-time.\\n\\n\"It honestly depends on who\\'s sitting on that committee. So if you have countries that already have anti-LGBTQIA+ policies in place, they\\'re going to be friendly to inviting these groups in and approving their status,\" says Kane.\\n\\nOnce these groups officially gain this status, they use religious freedom as a justification for promoting policies and laws that limit the rights of LGBTQIA+ people through the UN apparatus.\\n\\nThe UN Declaration of Human Rights does not yet explicitly protect folks who are discriminated against for their sexual orientation or gender identity. This lack of protection has given anti-LGBTQIA+ groups leverage in their arguments to roll back the rights of LGBTQIA+ folks.\\n\\nInside the UN, there are efforts to change this. For example, in 2019 the Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect published a Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech that outlines what constitutes hate speech and how to combat it. In it, they describe hate speech \"as any kind of communication in speech, writing or behaviour, that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender or other identity factor.\"\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, this new guidance is opposed by the anti-LGBTQIA+ hate groups. At the Political Network for Values Transatlantic Summit in November, ADF\\'s Kao said current hate speech laws protect too many different groups of people and in doing so infringe on religious freedom laws. \"Who can possibly know what would fall under such an expansive definition of hate?\" she said. \"These laws give a veto to any offended person, allowing them to censor their neighbours.\"\\n\\nBeirich strongly disagrees. \"You can\\'t use religion as a foil for harming communities and tearing into their civil and human rights. I don\\'t care,\" she says, adding that the Ku Klux Klan has weaponised religion as a means to discriminate against Black people since it was founded in 1865.\\n\\n\"It\\'s one thing to live your life however you want to live it biblically inspired. It\\'s a different thing to have that affect other people,\" says Beirich. \"Keep your views to yourself.\"\\n\\nAs these groups continue to operate inside the UN, what can be done? Datta says NGOs applying for Special Consultative Status should be subject to more rigorous background checks, where an independent body thoroughly examines the track record of applicants.\\n\\n\"What are the positions...of these organisations and what have they actually done?\" says Datta. \"What other things have they done which could be seen as having undermined human rights -- the UN\\'s Declaration of Human Rights?\"\\n\\nHe says using an independent body for this review would reduce the potential of political influences in the decision-making process.\\n\\nAs for those who already have Special Consultative Status, their status can be revoked if they don\\'t \"conform at all times to the principles governing the establishment.\"\\n\\nBeirich feels strongly that should happen swiftly for all six anti-LGBTQIA+ groups that currently hold this status. \"The United Nations should revoke the consultative status of people who stand opposed to the Universal Declaration. It shouldn\\'t stand for policies that are rolling back human rights -- it\\'s absurd.\"'}\n",

We saw and still see Americans put last, including our homeless veterans while illegal aliens prioritized. We have antisemitism and hate like I've never seen before. With 2 wars and the war in the Middle East because President Joe Biden funded our enemies, we saw the worst attack on our ally Israel since the Holocaust.\\n\\nI didn't want to give up but I knew our nation couldn't survive four more years of this. Thankfully the people spoke and we now will have the leader we need again in President Trump.\\n\\nPresident Trump has been called racist, a criminal, he's been framed, lied to, lied about, persecuted, prosecuted and convicted of crimes he never committed. In addition, he survived 3 assignation attempts. President Trump is not racist and he has committed no crimes. The only thing he did was love our country so much he stood up and still does, to the deep state, and he never backs down. I feel confident that President Trump will bring unity and prosperity to our nation along with Vice President Vance, the entire cabinet and one of my favorite people, Dr. Sebastian Gorka.\\n\\nThis should be a time to support them as they bring our country together that has been divided for years under Democratic rule. It is time to once again put America first and unite in that belief. We are lucky enough to live in the greatest country in the world and yet because so many have been brainwashed with hate and vitriolic lies it's a difficult thing to conquer. I still have unwavering faith in our country, President Trump, Vice President Vance, the new administration and Dr. Gorka.\\n\\nI also have faith in and believe in the goodness and grace of others to choose unity and not division. Together we can accomplish so much, we can all achieve our dreams but it's difficult with so many obstacles.\\n\\nI actually have recently faced obstacles myself. I wrote a previous op-ed on how the Department of Education has failed our students and parents alike. I was referring to public school and what I witnessed as a student in the public school I attended for I year. I also appeared on Fox News and reiterated what I felt and still feel about the DOE.\\n\\nThat op-ed and news appearance has caused a lot of stress and tension, a lot of anger within my school and yes, I have been bullied for supporting President Trump. I've been called racist which is ridiculous and untrue. I have lost people I thought were friends, and although it's been very difficult I will not waiver in my support of President Trump or my opinions of how our country had fallen apart in the past 4 years and President Trump's proven ability to save it. I was told because I don't believe DEI was being taught properly in public schools, that it was being used to divide kids that I am a racist. How anyone can think that from what I wrote or said is disturbing to me, but if someone won't listen to reason I can't make them.\\n\\nThe Democrats since Obama have used race to divide us: If you're white you're bad and if you're black you're oppressed. It only worsened with Obama and Harris. This is my opinion. I don't see or care about your skin color, your race, religion or sexual preference. I judge people on their own merits and that's the way it should be. I do believe DEI in the public schools is teaching kids to judge each other on skin color and religion instead of teaching kids that we are all equal and deserve equal opportunities. To me claiming white is bad and black people are victims creates a victim mentality and that to me is racism. Why is anyone better or worse because of their skin color, race or religion? They're not!\\n\\nI don't believe in a victim mentality, I believe no matter who you are you can achieve any goal but you have to work hard towards that goal, don't expect someone to do that for you. I will never judge anyone based on anything but morals, ethics, integrity and morality. I am raised that lying is a sin and we are on this earth to help others, not hate others. It hurt me deeply that I was called racist when just the opposite is true.\\n\\nI do not believe the DOE should be raising kids. I do not believe kids should be exposed to sex books or drag shows. I think schools should focus on education and giving kids the knowledge and skills they need to be successful. I believe parents' rights should never be questioned. I believe in free speech, I live by our Constitutional rights and I love and support President Trump and our country.\\n\\nI am told I'm in a cult because I support President Trump but why is wanting to Make America Great Again considered a cult?\\n\\nAs a Jewish conservative student I have never seen such divisiveness and hate. I sadly didn't realize how people would judge me just because I supported and will always support President Trump, I will always love our country, I will always fight for our constitutional rights and I will always see everyone as equal. I understand on a much smaller scale what President Trump goes through. I by no means am comparing myself to who I believe is the Greatest President we have ever had, I am simply pointing out I understand what he's faced.\\n\\nI don't believe we should ever notice our differences as we all bleed red and the only one that can limit your opportunities is you. We can all not just achieve our goals, we can exceed them. That's my wish for everyone and I won't stop caring or fighting for everyone to have those opportunities.\\n\\nI hope and pray this is a new beginning, that we will come together and not see or care about anything but what's in our hearts; hat whoever we choose as a candidate doesn't mean we have to hate each other because we have a difference in opinion. We all have a diversity of thoughts and opinions and that's a good thing but it shouldn't mean that it should separate us - we should embrace each other's differences and still realize in the end we are all Americans.\\n\\nPlease join me in supporting our great nation, President Trump, his cabinet and each other so we can have peace not only in our nation but in our local communities, our schools, our families and friendships.\\n\\nWe should all show respect to our President, our law enforcement and military heroes whether serving, retired, lost or fallen and respect our families, our friends and each other. We are put on this earth to make a difference, to help others in need and to pass on goodness to all including future generations to come. I hope we can all do that together, find a way to work together to create peace.\\n\\nDuring this holiday season, every season and every day, please realize how blessed we are to live in the greatest country in the world, and that we live free because of God, those who fought and died for us, and those still fighting for us today like President Trump. I hope we can all choose to be the good in this world and together we can help President Trump and each other to Make America Great Again.\\n\\nAuthor Recent Posts Jordan BraceJordan Brace is a California-based Gen Z political activist with over 120,000 followers on X.

It obtained complete responses from 611 adults 18 years old or above - 306 Malays, 200 Chinese, and 105 Indians.\\n\\nThe survey responses were derived from three questions: Whether the government should prohibit any discussion related to 3R issues even if the discussion is civil and rational; whether the government should prohibit hurtful or harmful comments in any discussion related to 3R issues; and whether the government should take stern action against the use, threat, or instigation of violence, whether or not the issue is related to the 3Rs.\\n\\nThe survey was conducted based on concerns whether Malaysia\\'s ethnic relations have deteriorated in recent years after democratisation when various sociopolitical forces were unleashed as society opened up.\\n\\n\"We decided that we wanted to find out for sure, especially after the KK Mart incident occurred, and subsequently more incidents came up,\" Projek Sama co-founder and Sunway University political scientist Prof Wong Chin Huat explains.\\n\\nThe KK Mart Group had in April made headlines when one of their outlets was found to be selling socks with the word \"Allah\" printed on them.\\n\\nProf Wong says most Malaysians value interdependence and prefer a balanced approach.\\n\\nAround 78% of the Malay respondents want the government to \"take stern actions against the use, threat, or instigation of violence, whether or not the issue is related to the 3Rs\".\\n\\n\"In contrast, 67% of the Malay respondents want the government to \\'prohibit hurtful or harmful comments in 3R discussions\\' while only 41% of the Malay respondents want the government \\'to prohibit any discussion related to 3R issues even if the discussion is civil and rational\\'.\"\\n\\nAmong the non-Malays, the survey found a similar but lower pattern of support on these three issues; Indian respondents are calling for action against violence at 63%, while prohibition of hate speech in 3R discussions at 56% and prohibition of all 3R discussions at 34%. Meanwhile, the number of Chinese respondents stands at 55%, 42%, and 26% respectively.\\n\\nProf Wong notes that Malaysia does not have a specific or new law on 3R issues, and the government should lift the blanket ban.\\n\\n\"It is for their own good. A blanket ban is simply impossible to execute because race, religion, and royalty play significant roles in our public life. Insisting on a blanket ban only gets the outcome of inconsistency or at least allegations of inconsistency.\\n\\n\"And guess what? When people think the government is biased, one common interpretation is that because the government is privileging the other ethnic or religious communities over our ethnic/religious community, so more bitterness grows around 3R matters. Completely counter-productive.\"\\n\\nLook at the real problem\\n\\nProf Wong points out that the real threat to society is violence followed by hate speech, not \"sensitive issues\".\\n\\n\"We hope the government and other authorities will take note that the real threat to our society is first violence, next hate speech and not the so-called sensitive issues.\\n\\n\"If anyone thinks that actions against violence would alienate the Malays, then the answer is the opposite,\" he says, referring to - four petrol bombs in the first three months of 2024, at Beruas MP Ngeh Koh Ham\\'s home, then at three KK Mart outlets.\\n\\n\"More than the Chinese and Indians, the Malays interviewed are strongly against violence.\"\\n\\nHe adds that inaction on the real violence could be seen as weak and soft on threats to public safety and law and order.\\n\\n\"If it\\'s caused by limitations in capacity - for example, all CCTVs around the four bombing sites were mysteriously not working - then government must put in more resources to avoid the \\'broken windows\\' effect, as acts of violence can easily inspire copycat actions,\" he says.\\n\\nProf Wong shares that many also feel that more fairness is needed in the actions taken.\\n\\n\"I embed myself in many WhatsApp groups in various languages and ethnoreligious orientations, and one common theme is this: The government is siding others. You can almost collect them to publish anthology.\\n\\nThe good news from the survey\\'s findings, according to him, is that while a majority of respondents across all three ethnic groups in West Malaysia thought that the government is not fair, more Malays (41% to 17%) and Chinese (32% to 23%) saw that unfairness from a class perspective than an ethnic perspective - that is, \"privileging the rich and the powerful over ordinary people like me\".\\n\\nHaving said that, if the 3R issues blanket ban continues - inevitably with inconsistent applications - more resentment would occur on all sides of the divide, says Prof Wong.\\n\\nPromote fairness and understanding\\n\\nProf Wong says there are two broad directions that can be worked on.\\n\\nFirst is to promote fairness.\\n\\n\"Both in public life in Malaysia and in the international arena, ethnoreligious centrism and exclusivism grow when people think the system is unfair.\\n\\n\"When people get so cynical as to stop believing in a fair world, they tend to be resentful of \\'the other\\' and crave \\'unity\\' within their own ethnoreligious/civilisational category to go against others.\\n\\n\"The good news is most Malaysians see our interdependence and prefer a balanced approach, believing that respect for Islam and respect for multiculturalism must go hand-in-hand.\"\\n\\nThis makes it important to take the second direction, which is to promote understanding.\\n\\n\"Our survey question on restrictions on personal freedom shows the greatest cross-ethnic divide between Malays and non-Malays. This is not surprising but there are still some convergences. At the same time, some of these issues may mean different things for different peoples.\\n\\n\"For example, halal requirement for Malays may mean assurance of getting religiously-compliant food, but for non-Malays it may imply restrictions to getting access to pork and alcohol.\\n\\n\"In other words, it is actually possible to find some convergences as it is possible to satisfy both Malays and non-Malays to some extent, if we have enough understanding and respect.\"\\n\\nProf Wong says Projek Sama hopes to carry out a similar survey in Sabah and Sarawak soon.\\n\\n\"Projek Sama\\'s inaugural survey only covered West Malaysia this round because of financial constraints. We were very grateful to our low-profile sponsor for a seed fund to kickstart this project.\"\\n\\nHence, he says, Projek Sama, in collaboration with pollster Invoke decided to focus on ethnic relations in West Malaysia first where ethnic relations are most challenging - \"It\\'s a bit like the situation during Covid-19 pandemic, if you don\\'t have enough vaccines, you send them to the area with the highest cases.\"\\n\\n\"We are working to get more funding for the next quarter so that we can have bigger samples from both West Malaysia as well as Sabah and Sarawak,\" Prof Wong says.'}\n",

Committee Experts commended the State on its guide on reporting hate crimes, and asked questions on alleged excessive use of force against minorities by the police and violations of the rights of asylum seekers by the Hellenic Coast Guard.\\n\\nOne Committee Expert welcomed the guide on reporting hate crimes. Were victims of hate crimes made aware of this guide?\\n\\nBakri Sidiki Diaby, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said there had been several allegations of excessive use of force against minorities by the police. How was the State party ensuring that all allegations were properly investigated, perpetrators punished, and victims granted reparations?\\n\\nMr. Diaby said that since March 2020, a significant deterioration had been noted in the security of persons from third countries seeking asylum in the east of Greece. There had been reports of summary forced return, secret detention, confiscation of personal effects, and intrusive searches. What steps had been taken to investigate these alleged violations of human rights and to prevent such violations?\\n\\nIntroducing the report, Aikaterini Patsogianni, Secretary General of Equality and Human Rights, Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family Affairs of Greece and head of the delegation, said that, in the fight against racism, police authorities had developed standards and guidance in areas such as training and capacity building of law enforcement, improved recording and collection of data on hate crimes, as well as cooperation between law enforcement and civil society organizations, and ways to address underreporting.\\n\\nThe delegation said one key initiative of the national action plan against racism and intolerance was the guide for victims on reporting hate crimes, which had been translated into nine languages and published online. Several training activities had been held to improve State authorities\\' response to hate crimes.\\n\\nPolice personnel were obliged to respect human rights and perform their duties based on respect for individuals, the delegation said. Over 1,000 cases of police misdemeanours had been conveyed to the Ombudsman, and around 660 disciplinary sanctions had been implemented.\\n\\nThe delegation said the Hellenic Coast Guard\\'s practices followed international law. Protecting human life at sea and aiding those in distress, without any form of discrimination, was the highest duty of the Coast Guard. All allegations of pushbacks were appropriately investigated by monitoring bodies. The Coast Guard had saved and continued to save thousands of lives at sea. From 2013, Coast Guard officers had been trained in basic human rights principles.\\n\\nIn concluding remarks, Mr. Diaby thanked the delegation for the dialogue, which had been intensive, fruitful, frank and necessary. The questions raised by the Committee aimed to assess progress in the implementation of the Convention to help the Committee to develop recommendations that were helpful to Greece.\\n\\nIn his concluding remarks, Ioannis Ghikas, Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said the dialogue had been intense but constructive, identifying issues that the State party needed to address. The State was proud of the progress it had made since the last review, including in protecting the rights of asylum seekers and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons.\\n\\nThe delegation of Greece consisted of representatives of the Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family Affairs; Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Ministry of Interior; Ministry of Education, Religious Affairs and Sports; Ministry of Health; Ministry of Citizen Protection; Ministry of Labour and Social Security; Ministry of Justice; Ministry of Migration and Asylum; Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Insular Policy; Hellenic Labour Inspectorate; Presidency of the Government; and the Permanent Mission of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva.\\n\\nThe Committee will issue its concluding observations on the report of Greece after the conclusion of its one hundred and fourteenthOpens in new window session on 13 December. The programme of work and other documents related to the session can be found hereOpens in new window. Summaries of the public meetings of the Committee can be found here, while webcasts of the public meetings can be found hereOpens in new window.\\n\\nThe Committee will next meet in public on Wednesday, 4 December at 3 p.m. to consider the combined eighth and ninth periodic report of Kenya (CERD/C/KEN/8-9Opens in new window).\\n\\nReport\\n\\nThe Committee has before it the combined twenty-third and twenty-fourth periodic report of Greece (CERD/C/GRC/23-24Opens in new window).\\n\\nPresentation of Report\\n\\nIOANNIS GHIKAS, Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said the dialogue would highlight the progress Greece had made. The State party had taken significant initiatives to combat racial discrimination, including by implementing the national action plan on preventing racism and intolerance, laws combatting hate speech, and training programmes for law enforcement officials. The State party had also adopted a national action plan on preventing anti-Semitism and had made efforts to promote the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, including by implementing legislation on same-sex marriage.\\n\\nProgress had been made despite the decade-long economic crisis that Greece had been facing. The racist \"Golden Dawn\" organization had been banned from participating in political activities and its leaders had been imprisoned. Civil society continued to support the State party\\'s efforts to prevent racism and intolerance. There was much work to be done, but Greece was committed to addressing the issues it faced, and looked forward to the recommendations of the Committee.\\n\\nAIKATERINI PATSOGIANNI, Secretary General of Equality and Human Rights, Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family Affairs of Greece and head of the delegation, said that since the last review, Greece had been advancing toward long-term sustainable economic progress, supporting its human rights and anti-racism framework. In the fight against racism, police authorities had developed standards and guidance in areas such as training and capacity building of law enforcement, improved recording and collection of data on hate crimes, as well as cooperation between law enforcement and civil society organizations, and ways to address underreporting. The judicial system responded to organizations that exploited the economic crisis and the resulting fractures to the social fabric to commit criminal racist acts, while the legislature took measures to protect and safeguard the democratic electoral process from such criminal organizations.\\n\\nThe National Council against Racism and Intolerance, in which independent bodies also participated, adopted its first national action plan in December 2020. Efforts for the second action plan were underway, with funding secured for a results-driven agenda. In this regard, the State party was ready to work with relevant stakeholders, including the Racist Violence Recording Network.\\n\\nGreece was actively implementing the National Strategy on the Roma 2021-2030, guided by the principle of \"for the Roma, with the Roma.\" Key committees, including the independent Roma Forum, were fully operational. All available European Union funding was used to enhance the Roma\\'s employment, education, healthcare and housing.\\n\\nOn migration, modernised reception facilities ensured dignified conditions and targeted care for vulnerable groups, while a robust system supported unaccompanied minors. The Asylum Service had significantly improved in efficiency. The \"HELIOS\" project and legal reforms promoted integration and labour market access. Enhanced international cooperation also provided pathways for organised, legal migration.\\n\\nBorder protection was carried out in line with domestic, European and international law. Protecting human life at sea and aiding those in distress, without any form of discrimination, was the highest duty of the Hellenic Coast Guard. Allegations of violations of the principle of non-refoulement were inconsistent with the operational activities of the competent agencies. The State had put in place a multi-level policy for the effective monitoring of fundamental rights. The Hellenic Coast Guard had saved and continued to save thousands of lives at sea.\\n\\nGreece had ratified International Labour Organization Convention 190 to create a work environment free from violence and harassment. Public authorities detected and protected all trafficking victims, without discrimination, in line with the principles of the Office of the National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings and the National Referral Mechanism.\\n\\nInclusive education was promoted through various initiatives and teacher training programmes. Key efforts included the \"Active Citizens\\' Actions\" curriculum supporting the Sustainable Development Goals, a 2023 anti-bullying law with a reporting platform, a mobile phone ban to reduce cyberbullying, and the introduction of \"Digital School\" and \"Skills Lab\" to enhance digital learning.\\n\\nThe State party had also established an independent Committee of Deontology, aimed at countering all types of expression in printed and electronic media that incited, promoted, spread or justified violence, hatred or discriminatory speech. Human rights education, training and awareness-raising activities, including for law enforcement personnel and members of the judiciary, remained top priorities.\\n\\nQuestions by a Committee Expert\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, thanked Greece for supporting the candidacy of Greek Expert Stamatia Stavrinaki to the Committee, who made remarkable contributions to its work.\\n\\nCould the delegation provide information on the ethnic makeup of the population and of asylum seekers and refugees living in the State party? The Committee was concerned by the general lack of disaggregated data on racial discrimination. What measures were in place to implement a comprehensive data collection system?\\n\\nWhat measures had the State party taken to address excessive use of force by the police? There had been several allegations of such excessive use of force against minorities. How was the State party ensuring that all allegations were properly investigated, perpetrators punished, and victims granted reparations?\\n\\nThere was a limited number of convictions for cases involving racial discrimination and official data on cases reported to the police was not accessible to the public. The Committee was concerned that the new anti-racist law was not fully in line with the requirements of article four of the Convention as it did not criminalise the dissemination of ideas of racial superiority or prohibit racist organizations. What measures were in place to revise legislation to ensure that all incitement to racial, ethnic and religious hatred was criminalised and that perpetrators were punished? How had the police\\'s capacity to investigate racist crimes and to combat racist violence been increased? State services reportedly did not provide appropriate, timely support to victims of racist violence, who relied on support from civil society. Was a referral system for victims to State services being developed?\\n\\nOver the reporting period, there had been 89 reported cases of racism targeting asylum seekers and refugees. The Committee welcomed the various legislative measures undertaken to address racism. Were there gaps in the implementation of legislation on racism? Was there a media regulatory body that held journalists to account when they disseminated racist notions?\\n\\nWas the State party drafting a new national action plan to combat racism and intolerance? What results had the last action plan achieved? The National Council against Racism and Intolerance had been reactivated in 2024. What measures were in place to ensure that the Council could work effectively?\\n\\nWhy had there been delays in the registration of civil society organizations claiming to have minority status? Some minority associations had been dissolved; could the delegation comment on this?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece did not collect statistical data based on race and religious affiliations due to its protection of the right to privacy. Statistical data was collected on specific categories of beneficiaries of State policies, such as policies for the Roma. Data was also collected on the demographics of prison inmates, and on migrants, asylum seekers and refugees according to European Union regulations. A unified information system for reception and asylum was being developed. Data on migrants\\' gender, ethnicity and religion was collected.\\n\\nAfter 2015, there was an amendment to legislation concerning the punishment of hate crimes that facilitated the investigation and prosecution of cases by eliminating the need to prove the standard of \"hate\". Data from the judiciary and the Public Prosecutor showed that there had been better implementation of hate crime legislation in recent years. The State party also had legislation on hate speech and incitement to hatred that addressed speech inciting racial superiority.\\n\\n\"Golden Dawn\" was not allowed to participate in elections and State funding to it had been suspended. All political parties that acted as proxies for persons who had committed racist hate crimes were prohibited, and on this basis two political parties had recently been banned from participating in elections.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said human rights defenders were sometimes accused and condemned without having the opportunity to defend themselves. Did the State party intend to adopt special legislation to protect human rights defenders? Several dozens of cases of refoulement involving Greece had been examined by the European Court of Human Rights. Were border police trained on the handling of migrants? What aid had been provided to victims of police violence?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said that although the European Union directive on victim support had been incorporated into national legislation, there were allegations that the directive was not sufficiently applied, leading to impunity for perpetrators of racist acts. How did the State party collect data on foreign nationals in the prison system? What recommendations had been provided by the Racist Violence Reporting Network to the State and had these been implemented?\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert asked about the effectiveness of State policies. How many of the cases of police misconduct reported had resulted in sanctions? How many committees reviewing journalistic ethics had members of racial minority groups?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece had permitted the reopening of domestic court proceedings after decisions on three cases by the European Court of Human Rights. A committee of independent experts had been established to develop strategies for the implementation of the European Court\\'s decisions.\\n\\nPolice personnel were obliged to respect human rights and perform their duties based on respect for individuals. They needed to avoid prejudice based on distinguishing characteristics. The Hellenic Police transmitted relevant information to an independent Ombudsman concerning cases involving discrimination. Over 1,000 cases of police misdemeanours had been conveyed to the Ombudsman, and around 660 disciplinary sanctions had been implemented. Several cases related to racist actions by the police.\\n\\nThe law on audiovisual media services prohibited the dissemination of hate speech based on race and other characteristics. The National Media Advisory Authority had the competence to impose sanctions for disseminating hate speech through online and offline media. All print and online media needed to meet requirements related to the Journalistic Code of Ethics, which included prohibitions of hate speech. The Journalistic Ethics Committee was mandated to investigate all allegations of discriminatory speech. Its members were not appointed based on their ethnicity or sex but were journalists and academics.\\n\\nIn Greece, persons with low income could apply for free legal aid. Legal aid was also provided to victims in trafficking cases and to female victims of violence. Measures were in place to protect victims from secondary victimisation in legal proceedings. All victims were informed of their rights, including the right to compensation.\\n\\nThe Greek legislative framework did not have a specific law for the protection of human rights defenders; all persons were equal before the law.\\n\\nPrivate funding of political parties was strictly forbidden in Greece. Only State funding was legal for political parties. This was why State funding had been suspended for parties that engaged in hate crimes and hate speech.\\n\\nQuestions by a Committee Expert\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said not all incidents of racism were reported by victims, allegedly due to a lack of confidence in the authorities. What measures were in place to strengthen confidence in the justice system among citizens? Did the State party intend to establish an efficient data collection system on racist violence? How would it promote access to justice for victims of racial discrimination? How many complaints of racist hate speech and hate crimes had been received by the State and how many perpetrators had been prosecuted? In how many court cases had the Convention been cited? What measures had the State party taken to encourage the participation of civil society in the implementation of the Convention? Racism continued to be prevalent in the Attica region and in centres where refugees and asylum seekers were located. Did the State party intend to accept the Committee\\'s communications procedure?\\n\\nDiscrimination against minorities by authorities persisted. What recent educational initiatives had been implemented to combat intolerance and prejudice and promote intercultural dialogue? The State party had received the Global Education Award for establishing the Skills Lab, which promoted ethnic tolerance. Was this implemented in all regions of the State party and at all levels?\\n\\nThe Committee commended the State party for its efforts to create memorials of the Holocaust. There were 158 attacks based on religion recorded in 2023. What measures were in place to ensure efficient investigations of these incidents and to develop protection measures? There had also been an increase in cases of vandalism of religious sites and profanation in recent years. What measures were in place to put an end to these practices?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the police code of conduct required police to act with empathy toward vulnerable people. The State party collected data on hate speech and hate crimes, including data on racially motivated crimes.\\n\\nIn Greek prisons, data was collected on nationality. Foreigners from 101 nationalities made up 50 per cent of the prison population. These were persons who were convicted and serving these sentences in Greek prisons. Greece was on the crossroads of many routes, and many people in prisons in Greece were engaged in cross-border criminal activity.\\n\\nThe Ombudsperson received discrimination complaints. Racial discrimination complaints made up seven per cent of complaints received in 2023, up from two per cent in 2022. The labour inspectorate examined complaints of workplace discrimination. The inspectorate was empowered to instigate administrative sanctions. Three cases it investigated in 2023 involved discrimination on the grounds of nationality.\\n\\nThe police had established specialised departments to address violent hate crimes and hate speech and provide support to victims in Attica and the Eastern Aegean region. A hotline and online form for reporting hate crimes had been implemented, and several campaigns were underway on online hate speech. The police force was cooperating with civil society, which provided training to upgrade the capacities of police staff.\\n\\nThe Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure had been revised to make them more victim centred. Courts had been redistributed to improve citizens\\' access across the State. Domestic violence legislation had also been modernised.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, asked for statistics on victims of discrimination who had benefitted from free legal aid. There was a large gap between the records of racist violence of the Racist Violence Reporting NetworkOpens in new window and the Government. Why was this? On what basis was the second national action plan on addressing racism being devised?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said that it was quite shocking that 50 per cent of prisoners in Greece were non-nationals.\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert said that the State\\'s regulations on the provision of legal aid appeared to limit access to it. Would it consider implementing a system of reviewing all requests for legal aid, regardless of the type of crime?\\n\\nA Committee Expert asked whether the labour inspectorate assigned fines for workplace discrimination. Why were non-nationals in Attica most impacted by racist crimes? How did the State party apply the recommendations of the Racist Violence Reporting Network? The Expert welcomed the guide on reporting hate crimes. Were victims made aware of this guide?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the national action plan against racism and intolerance focused on addressing hate crimes, empowering minorities, and eliminating discrimination based on various characteristics. One key initiative was the guide for victims on reporting hate crimes, which had been translated into nine languages and distributed to migrant reception centres and published online. Several training activities had been held to improve State authorities\\' response to hate crimes.\\n\\nThe National Council against Racism and Intolerance had held meetings with civil society to develop the second national action plan on addressing racism and intolerance. It had secured funding to improve victims\\' access to State services. The Council would review the Committee\\'s recommendations and include them in the second national action plan, which would focus on strengthening data collection on hate crimes and developing more services for victims.\\n\\nThe Skills Lab initiative had been piloted nationwide. New curricula promoted human rights education and intercultural communication. Training courses were offered for teachers on human rights and inclusion. A digital platform for reporting school bullying and violence had been launched. As of April 2024, over 700 reports had been received, 10 per cent of which related to racism.\\n\\nVarious actions had been taken to provide education about the Holocaust. Greece was one of the first countries to return the property of victims of the Holocaust. The State collected data on vandalism of religious sites. In 2015, 147 cases were recorded.\\n\\nThe procedure for applying for free legal aid was very simple. Applicants needed only to supply documents proving that they had low income. Victims of almost all crimes could apply for this aid. Lawyers could be appointed for defendants in serious crimes with punishments of five years imprisonment or more.\\n\\nOn some occasions, victims of racist violence went to the Racist Violence Reporting Network but not to public authorities. In 2023, 115 cases had been opened by authorities. There was not a big gap between the number of cases collected by authorities and by the Network. More than half of the population lived in Attica. This was why most racist crimes were reported in this region.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said 18 per cent of asylum camp residents did not enjoy basic material conditions, including food and financial assistance. There were only 29 doctors, 92 nurses and 69 interpreters deployed across all the camps, some of which had more than 1,000 residents. What measures were in place to improve the situation in the camps and ensure that the detention of foreign nationals was only done as a last resort? How was the State party ensuring access to interpretation services for foreign nationals? What efforts had been made to develop a statelessness establishment procedure? How was the State party addressing barriers to refugees accessing official documents?\\n\\nWhat steps had been taken to investigate alleged violations of human rights in the context of border management and to prevent such violations? Was there regular independent surveillance of border forces and efforts to strengthen their capacity? Since March 2020, a significant deterioration had been noted in the security and safety of persons from third countries seeking asylum in the east of Greece. There had been reports of summary forced return of persons who had entered from Türkiye, secret detention without sufficient safeguards, confiscation of personal effects, and intrusive searches. There were also reports of private individuals towing and removing engines from asylum seekers\\' boats, and assisting officials in carrying out forced returns.\\n\\nGreece had not signed the statelessness convention and the Presidential decree on the statelessness determination procedure had not been promulgated. Around 3,740 people in Greece had stated that they had no nationality. What measures would the State party take to better address the issue of statelessness?\\n\\nThe Committee had previously expressed concern regarding low salaries and long working hours for migrant workers, particularly in the agricultural sector. What measures were in place to improve the situation of migrant workers? Was there a safe and accessible way of filing complaints related to workplace discrimination? What measures were in place to support undocumented migrants and protect them from trafficking and forced labour?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said seminars on human rights and diversity had been provided for over 1,600 public servants. Seminars had been held on the Holocaust for members of the Orthodox Church of Greece and on the basic principles of Islam for prison officers. Over 160 integrity advisors had also been trained and certified to support integrity in the public service. The national school of the judiciary provided mandatory training on human rights, gender-based violence and other topics. In 2024, 15 seminars had been planned for judges and 12 for court staff.\\n\\nGreece directly implemented the Convention in domestic law, which was why court decisions did not directly reference the Convention.\\n\\nIf infringements of labour laws were found, labour inspectors could impose administrative sanctions and fines, and file serious cases of non-compliance with the Prosecutor.\\n\\nRefugee children could enrol in reception classes without documentation. Language classes were offered for students after school hours. Educational guides assisted teachers in making refugee students feel welcome and safe.\\n\\nGreece was facing challenges with the arrival of third country nationals seeking to enter Europe through Türkiye. It had accelerated asylum procedures through the digitisation of asylum procedures. Health care insurance and tax identification numbers were provided to asylum seekers, who could access employment and healthcare throughout the State.\\n\\nOne of the main priorities of Greece\\'s migration policy was to improve asylum conditions. Case managers carried out rapid assessments of new arrivals\\' needs. Vulnerable persons were provided with specialised protection. More interpreters were being provided in collaboration with various public and private organizations and civil society. The \"HELIOS\" integration system offered support to refugees to access the labour market, health and education. Another initiative was specifically focused on providing language, vocational and intercultural training to refugees seeking to enter the job market.\\n\\nMigration legislation had been amended to reduce the number of migrants in informal employment. An agreement had been reached with Egypt on the provision of temporary employment to Egyptian citizens in the agricultural sector. An agreement was also reached with Bangladeshi citizens to improve access to formal employment. These agreements reenforced legal pathways to migration.\\n\\nThe average time taken to process asylum applications was now 100 days; formerly processing took years. Greece collaborated with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to develop a new system of naturalisation that was fairer for refugees and stateless persons. Around 55 applications for Greek citizenship had been received; only 16 were still pending, citizenship had been granted for the rest.\\n\\nPolice had circulated guidelines on the protection of the fundamental rights of refugees arriving in the State. No third country national was to be returned until their asylum application had been processed.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said violence and excessive use of force had been reported in asylum centres. Could the delegation comment on this? Mr. Diaby congratulated the State party on efforts to formalise the status of stateless persons. Did the State party intend to ratify the statelessness convention? How was the State party responding to racist incidents in sport?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert asked about the results of the human rights education strategies implemented by the State.\\n\\nFAITH DIKELEDI PANSY TLAKULA, Committee Expert and Follow-Up Rapporteur, said the Committee had previously recommended that the State party provide training to teachers on providing education to migrant children, ensure individual assessment of asylum applications, and protect against refoulement. What efforts had been made to improve migrants\\' access to asylum procedures and education?\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert said that in recent years, there had been a rise in hate speech across the world, including in Greece. What measures were in place to tackle racist hate speech targeting migrants and minorities, and xenophobia?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the State was proud of improvements that had been made in the situation on the State\\'s islands. The Hellenic Coast Guard\\'s practices followed international law. All allegations of pushbacks were appropriately investigated by monitoring bodies. From 2015 to the present, the Coast Guard had rescued over 250,000 persons at sea. From 2013, Coast Guard officers had been trained in basic human rights principles.\\n\\nGreece was stepping up efforts to prevent trafficking in persons through legal and policy instruments. The national action plan on trafficking in persons was being updated to address financial and labour exploitation. The State party had organised seminars and created standards on the financial aspects of these crimes. New forms of exploitation had been added to legislation. Accommodation, medical care and legal counselling were provided to victims of trafficking in persons. A leaflet on human trafficking had been produced in several languages.\\n\\nThe State party was prioritising the ratification of International Labour Organization convention 29 on forced labour. This process was expected to be completed soon. A plan for the prevention of labour exploitation was formulated by the State each year and preventative inspections were carried out twice a year in vulnerable sectors. Employees could file complaints through an online anonymous complaints service, by email or a telephone hotline. The State provided migrant workers with information about their rights.\\n\\nA programme was in place to increase access to medical staff in asylum centres through measures such as the temporary transfer of medical personnel. Around 16,200 refugee students from 70 different countries were enrolled in Greek educational institutions. Case managers trained in the best interests of the child monitored age assessment procedures, which would soon be harmonised across all European Union Member States.\\n\\nGreece had ratified the regional conventions on safety in sport matches and had implemented legislation that prohibited banners at sporting matches with racist or sexist content.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said Greece only formally recognised one minority, Thrace Muslims. Why were other minority groups not recognised as minorities? What data was collected on minorities? How well represented was the Muslim minority in public bodies and in elected roles at national and local levels?\\n\\nWhat outcomes had been achieved by the last national strategy on the inclusion of the Roma and what progress had been made in implementing the current strategy? Were the Roma consulted about policies and strategies that affected them? Roma people reportedly continued to be victims of discrimination in Greece when trying to access healthcare, housing and employment. Many Roma people lived below the poverty threshold and struggled to access basic services. What measures were in place to ensure equal access for Roma children to education and schooling? What measures were in place to improve access to paid employment and quality healthcare for the Roma? Roma often lacked access to heating, running water and toilets. How was the State party preventing forced evictions and fines for illegal construction? Roma people faced long, costly judicial procedures to acquire Greek nationality. How was the State party promoting their access to nationality?\\n\\nThe Committee noted the adoption of several laws and the national strategy in favour of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. However, this community continued to be subjected to discrimination in schools and public services. What measures were in place to tackle such discrimination? What results had the national strategy achieved?\\n\\nThere were reports of migrant women, including pregnant women, having been assaulted by Greek Coast Guards. Greece had the highest rate of femicide in Europe. What measures were in place to address violence against women?\\n\\nWhat statistics did the State party have on people of African descent and their integration in public life? What activities had been undertaken as part of the International Decade for People of African Descent? How was the State party combatting the multiple forms of discrimination faced by this group? What measures were in place to implement the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action? Was there a formal mechanism in place to assess its implementation?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the term \"minority\" in Greece was understood under stricter criteria than those of the Committee. The State party respected the principle of self-identification. Groups of people who were not recognised as a minority enjoyed all rights under the Convention. Four members of the Hellenic Parliament were Muslims, and more than 100 Muslims had been elected to public bodies.\\n\\nThe Roma had expressed the will not to be considered as an ethnic minority. Authorities paid particular attention to this vulnerable group. The State had made the civil registry process easier and more efficient for the Roma. The previous strategy on Roma inclusion provided specific interventions to address early school dropouts and support access to health and housing. Implementation of this strategy was independently reviewed. There were also 85 local action plans on Roma support elaborated with the Roma population. There was an open, independent consultation platform with 13 Roma organizations that met every three months to devise strategies for Roma inclusion.\\n\\nRoma people were eligible for all State welfare benefits. The State party was promoting the Roma\\'s participation in education and the labour market. The public employment service implemented targeted programmes for the Roma, such as 15,000-euro subsidies for Roma who started a business and training and certification in technical jobs.\\n\\nThe Government had taken measures to facilitate the inclusion of Roma children in education. Psychosocial support was provided to vulnerable students in schools. Roma children could be enrolled in schools without official documentation. Teacher training programmes were provided on combatting early school dropouts and supporting Roma children.\\n\\nThe State party did not have records of complaints against Coast Guard officials regarding sexual assault of pregnant women. This year, there had been 12 victims of femicide. The State party had ratified the Istanbul Convention and was collecting data on violence against women and conducting training in schools to raise awareness of the issue. There was a large network of structures for supporting women victims, who had access to emergency accommodation.\\n\\nThe national strategy on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons aimed to combat discrimination and promote equality for these people. All ministries carried out actions supporting these people.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said there were gaps between policies for the Roma and practices. What was the size of the Roma population? What were the causes of femicides in the State party and the ethnic origins of the victims? Had the State party considered making a law on femicide?\\n\\nA Committee Expert said Roma children were being segregated in Greek schools. How many Roma children were participating in and graduating from inclusive public education?\\n\\nFAITH DIKELEDI PANSY TLAKULA, Committee Expert and Follow-Up Rapporteur, said the Committee had previously expressed concern about the poor working conditions of migrant workers in the agricultural sector and the informal economy. What investigations had been carried out into the exploitation of migrant workers and what compensation was provided to victims? Were employers who imposed abusive labour conditions subjected to criminal sanctions? What training was provided to labour inspectors on identifying victims of human trafficking?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said Greece\\'s efforts to preserve its historical monuments were commendable.\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece was home to a vibrant community of people of African descent, many of whom held leading roles in civil society and public organizations. Greece fully supported the pending General Assembly resolution to declare a second International Decade for People of African DescentOpens in new window. The National Council against Racism and Intolerance was implementing measures to support the rights of people of African descent.\\n\\nThere were 120,000 Roma people in Greece, 20,000 of whom received guaranteed minimum income support. To encourage school attendance, families whose children did not attend school did not receive welfare benefits. Investments had been made to improve housing infrastructure in Roma communities.\\n\\nAround 1,600 labour inspections were carried out this year and fines were issued in around 700 cases. Twenty cases had been reported to the Public Prosecutor regarding potential victims of trafficking in persons. Standards had been developed for seasonal housing for migrant workers. The labour inspectorate\\'s staff had been increased recently. All inspectors participated in training on preventing and identifying human trafficking.\\n\\nClosing Remarks\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, thanked the delegation for the dialogue, which had been intensive, fruitful, frank and necessary. The questions raised by the Committee aimed to assess progress in the implementation of the Convention to help the Committee to develop recommendations that were helpful to Greece.\\n\\nIOANNIS GHIKAS, Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said the dialogue had been intense but constructive, identifying issues that the State party needed to address. Greece was proud of the Greek Committee Expert Stamatia Stavrinaki, who was an excellent representative of the tradition of human rights scholarship in Greece. The strong representation of women in the delegation was a representation of the reality in Greece, where promoting women\\'s representation was a high priority. The State was proud of the progress it had made since the last review, including in protecting the rights of asylum seekers and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons.'}\n",

By contrasting the prohibition of prayer in secular systems with the tolerance of this slur, the paper critiques the inadequacies of current structural frameworks in addressing systemic injustice. It further explores how language shapes societal norms and proposes a framework for rethinking linguistic accountability, with a focus on scientific and sociological research. The paper concludes by recommending legislative, cultural, and educational strategies to eradicate this term, emphasizing its potential to serve as a precedent for combating other forms of hate speech.\\n\\nLanguage is a powerful tool for constructing reality. Words have the ability to heal, inspire, harm, or dehumanize. Few words encapsulate this duality as starkly as the racial slur \"nigger.\" Originating in colonial times as a means of dehumanizing African-descended individuals, this word persists as a vestige of slavery and systemic racism. While the global community recognizes hate speech as a moral and legal offense, this particular term remains paradoxically present in cultural and societal contexts. This paper explores why its abolition is necessary, examining systemic contradictions such as the prohibition of prayer in secular institutions, which reflects inconsistent applications of societal norms.\\n\\nThe word \"nigger\" is not merely a slur; it is a linguistic artifact of oppression. Its use was instrumental in the transatlantic slave trade, serving to justify inhuman treatment and the commodification of Black individuals. Even post-slavery, its usage perpetuated psychological trauma and reinforced systemic segregation. This section will:\\n\\nDiscuss its transition into contemporary usage, including its appropriation in some cultural contexts.\\n\\n2.1 Psychological and Sociological Impacts\\n\\nNumerous studies document the detrimental effects of slurs on mental health, self-perception, and societal cohesion. This section will review research on how such language perpetuates stereotypes, normalizes violence, and undermines equality.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3. The Structural Contradictions of Language and Law\\n\\n3.1 Prohibition of Prayer vs. Tolerance of Slurs\\n\\nModern secular systems often prohibit religious expression, such as prayer, in public spaces to maintain neutrality. However, the tolerance or legal protection of hate speech like \"nigger\" reveals a profound inconsistency. This section will:\\n\\nAnalyze legal frameworks governing free speech and hate speech.\\n\\nContrast the treatment of spiritual expressions and harmful language.\\n\\nExamine the ethical implications of these inconsistencies.\\n\\n3.2 Systemic Inadequacies\\n\\nThe persistence of this slur highlights structural failures in addressing racism. These include:\\n\\nEducational deficits in teaching about historical racism.\\n\\n4.1 Linguistic Accountability and Societal Health\\n\\nLanguage shapes cultural norms and individual behaviors. Allowing derogatory terms like \"nigger\" to persist undermines societal progress. Abolition serves not only as a symbolic act but as a practical step toward dismantling systemic racism.\\n\\n4.2 International Precedents\\n\\nCountries like Germany have outlawed Nazi symbols and hate speech to prevent the perpetuation of oppressive ideologies. This section will analyze these precedents and their applicability to abolishing the word \"nigger.\"\\n\\n4.3 Practical Strategies for Abolition\\n\\nLegislation: Enacting laws to classify the word as hate speech subject to penalties.\\n\\nCultural Transformation: Promoting alternative narratives and redefining societal values through media and art.\\n\\nEducation: Developing curricula that address the history and harm of this word.\\n\\nPrayer, often prohibited in secular systems, represents spiritual and personal empowerment. Its suppression contrasts sharply with the permissibility of language that dehumanizes. This section examines:\\n\\nThe role of prayer in fostering social cohesion and personal resilience.\\n\\nThe systemic bias in prioritizing secular neutrality over human dignity.\\n\\nHow addressing such contradictions can strengthen structural justice.\\n\\nThis paper proposes a unified framework to address linguistic and structural inequities:\\n\\nRestorative Justice: Encouraging reparative dialogue and reconciliation.\\n\\nLegislative Reform: Balancing free speech with protections against harm.\\n\\nGlobal Solidarity: Collaborating across cultures to combat hate speech.\\n\\nThe abolition of the word \"nigger\" represents a critical step in addressing systemic racism and linguistic harm. By treating its usage as a form of societal profligation subject to severe penalties, we signal a commitment to justice and equity. Contrasting this with the prohibition of prayer reveals deep systemic contradictions, underscoring the need for comprehensive reform. A future free of such dehumanizing language is possible through legislative action, cultural transformation, and education.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe word \"nigger\" holds a unique and deeply traumatic position in the history of racial oppression, symbolizing systemic racism and violence. Despite occasional reappropriation within Black communities, its continued use outside these contexts perpetuates harm, discrimination, and psychological trauma. This paper contrasts the societal prohibition of \"prayer\" in certain public or governmental spaces with the tolerated use of racial slurs, highlighting structural inconsistencies. By drawing from historical, psychological, and legal perspectives, this study advocates for the abolition of such language through strict societal and legal frameworks.\\n\\nHistorical Context and Systemic Impacts\\n\\nThe n-word\\'s origin as a tool of dehumanization dates back to slavery and segregation, where it was a prelude to violence, including lynching and other atrocities. Its persistence symbolizes a system that normalizes anti-Blackness and undermines societal equity. Scholars have identified the word as \"the atomic bomb of racial slurs,\" reflecting its uniquely destructive psychological and societal impact. The term reinforces systemic racism by perpetuating stereotypes and fostering environments where discrimination thrives (sources: ADL, Psychology Today).\\n\\nLegal and Psychological Perspectives\\n\\nThe legal system inconsistently addresses hate speech and racial slurs. While hate crimes laws penalize acts motivated by bias, proving intent remains challenging. The n-word often functions as a trigger for violence, demonstrating its potent psychological effects. Studies show that exposure to racial slurs can cause enduring trauma, influencing behaviors and mental health over time (sources: OHCHR, OJP, Psychology Today).\\n\\nStructural Inadequacies: Prayer vs. Hate Speech\\n\\nContrasting the restriction of prayer in public institutions with the leniency towards racial slurs highlights systemic contradictions. Prayer is often prohibited in contexts aiming to uphold neutrality and prevent marginalization. However, the tolerance of racial epithets undermines this neutrality by tacitly endorsing harm against marginalized groups. This inconsistency reveals a structural failure to equitably protect individual dignity and safety.\\n\\nRecommendations\\n\\n1. Abolition Through Legislation: Strengthen hate speech laws to explicitly include the prohibition of racial slurs, with penalties reflecting their societal harm.\\n\\n2. Education and Awareness: Implement educational initiatives to address the history and impact of such language, emphasizing its role in systemic oppression.\\n\\n3. Community Empowerment: Support the reappropriation of language within marginalized communities while discouraging its use by others to prevent perpetuation of harm.\\n\\n4. Structural Reforms: Address systemic biases in policy-making that tolerate harmful language while restricting other forms of expression.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe systemic tolerance of racial slurs like the n-word is a manifestation of structural racism that undermines societal progress. Abolishing such language requires a comprehensive approach involving legal, educational, and social reforms. Addressing this issue not only honors the dignity of those affected but also strengthens the moral and ethical fabric of society.\\n\\nIn the sprawling labyrinth of systemic governance, where laws claim to safeguard dignity and equality, a glaring hypocrisy festers. On one hand, institutions silence prayer -- a quiet invocation of hope, unity, and introspection -- under the guise of secular neutrality. On the other, these same systems shield hate speech, particularly the visceral linguistic weaponry of the word \"nigger,\" cloaking its use in the sanctity of \"free expression.\" This contradiction is not a mere oversight but a seismic failure of moral and structural integrity. The persistence of this slur serves as an indictment of the inadequacies of modern systems, exposing their complicity in perpetuating oppression while masquerading as bastions of liberty.\\n\\n1. Prayer: Silenced Benevolence\\n\\nPrayer, an act of spiritual alignment and communal solace, is systematically expunged from public spaces to uphold secularism. This prohibition is framed as essential to protecting inclusivity, yet it suppresses a harmless, often uplifting practice. The rationale behind this exclusion betrays a fear of offense, yet paradoxically, it allows offensive language -- rooted in hate -- to flourish unchecked.\\n\\n2. The N-Word: Protected Oppression\\n\\nThe n-word, a verbal relic of slavery\\'s barbarity, survives as a cultural anomaly: a word so potent in its dehumanization that it continues to wound across generations. Protected by laws intended to defend expression, it has become a totem of systemic hypocrisy. By tolerating its usage, societies tacitly endorse its underlying ideology -- one that denies humanity and perpetuates racial hierarchies.\\n\\nSanctifying Harm, Criminalizing Hope\\n\\nThe double standard between prayer and slurs unmasks a systemic prioritization of abstract ideals over tangible harm. Prayer, which often fosters connection and resilience, is suppressed as potentially divisive, while slurs, which undeniably fracture the social fabric, are tolerated. This prioritization reveals a skewed moral compass, where the avoidance of ideological discomfort supersedes the protection of human dignity.\\n\\nLegal Contradictions as a Disgrace\\n\\nSecular laws punish expressions of spirituality to preserve neutrality, yet they fail to curtail language explicitly designed to oppress. This contradiction underscores the inadequacy of frameworks that claim to champion equality while upholding structural inequities.\\n\\n1. Legislative Abolition of Hate Speech\\n\\nSocieties must confront their linguistic relics with unflinching clarity. Laws should eradicate racial slurs from public lexicons, treating them as instruments of psychological violence. This abolition would signal a decisive rejection of systemic racism.\\n\\n2. Cultural Renaissance\\n\\nA cultural movement is needed to reclaim linguistic spaces from the shadows of oppression. Through art, education, and public discourse, society must dismantle the normalized violence of slurs while redefining speech as a tool for justice, not harm.\\n\\n3. Reframing Freedom\\n\\nTrue freedom lies not in the unchecked license to harm but in the empowerment of individuals to coexist with dignity. Reframing freedom as responsibility would enable societies to prioritize collective well-being over the preservation of outdated and oppressive norms.\\n\\nThe systemic tolerance of the n-word, juxtaposed with the prohibition of prayer, symbolizes a deep moral chasm. This inconsistency is not just a structural flaw but a betrayal of justice itself. To reclaim societal integrity, we must uproot these double standards and construct frameworks that honor the intrinsic worth of every individual. The abolition of hateful language is not an attack on freedom but its ultimate affirmation -- a visionary step toward a future where words heal rather than harm.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

But we have been engaged in a decades-long, deeply illiberal experiment in policing 'hate speech' - which is now making us an international laughing stock.\\n\\nThe offence of inciting racial hatred, of which Pearson was accused, was first created in Britain in 1965, with the passage of the Race Relations Act. This notion that it was the role of the state to define and police hatred - that, in essence, censorship was our path to racial harmony - was enshrined in law and elite culture.\\n\\nThis sits in stark contrast to the United States. It was in the 1960s - amid the civil-rights revolution, the bottom-up demand from black Americans for their rights - that the expansive free-speech protections Americans now enjoy were won. Until then, the First Amendment had essentially been a dead letter - gifted by the Founders but never enforced in practice.\\n\\nThe project of speech policing and thought control was embraced enthusiastically by Tony Blair's government. In 2006, the then New Labour government passed the Racial and Religious Hatred Act, introducing the offence of 'incitement to religious hatred'. Were it not for a successful campaign to rein in that legislation, led by comedian Rowan Atkinson, it would have criminalised 'abusive or insulting' language about religion, too.\\n\\nBut arguably Blair's more consequential contribution to 'hate speech' legislation came with the Communications Act of 2003. Under Section 127 of this law, it is illegal to send 'by means of a public electronic-communications network a message or other matter that is grossly offensive'. While this was an update on a pre-existing telecoms offence, it made it match fit for the digital age.\\n\\nIndeed, the combination of Britain's already-repressive speech laws and the dawn of the social-media era proved to be a disastrous mix - particularly for the nation's more obnoxious young people. In the early 2010s, there were a slew of cases in which teenagers and university students were sent to prison for saying stupid, outrageous and often downright despicable things on social media. Often while drunk.\\n\\nIn 2012, Swansea student Liam Stacey was convicted of a racially aggravated public-order offence over racist tweets he posted after Bolton Wanderers footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed from a heart attack during a match. Stacey was sentenced to 56 days in prison.\\n\\nThat same year, teenager Matthew Woods was jailed for three months for a string of 'grossly offensive' Facebook posts about missing young girls April Jones and Madeleine McCann. While inebriated, at a friend's house, Woods began his tirade by copying, pasting and sharing sick jokes from the website 'Sickipedia'.\\n\\nThere was also Jake Newsome, given six weeks in prison in 2014 for saying on Facebook that he was 'glad' that a Leeds teacher had been murdered by a pupil. And there was 20-year-old Azhar Ahmed, fined £300 and ordered to do community service for posting, again on Facebook, that 'all soldiers should die and go to hell'.\\n\\nThe investigations, arrests and even convictions for online speech reached well beyond genuine bigots and trolls. Telling jokes became a risky business. Famously, Paul Chambers was found guilty in 2010 of sending a 'menacing electronic communication' for an obvious joke on Twitter, threatening to blow Robin Hood Airport 'sky high', after he was infuriated to find out it was closed.\\n\\nAs the trans issue came into view, it became clear that even mainstream opinions - such as not believing that men can become women - could also be rebranded as 'hateful' by our increasingly identitarian authorities.\\n\\nGender-critical feminist Kate Scottow was arrested in 2018 for causing 'needless anxiety' after she persistently called a man 'he' on social media. It was overturned on appeal. Christian preacher David McConnell similarly had to be tried and convicted before the courts realised 'misgendering' isn't actually a crime. Not yet, at least.\\n\\nNot only did those supposedly freedom-loving Conservatives do nothing during their 14 years in power to repeal any of this censorious legislation, they actually made things worse.

It's something that we do need to clear up.\\n\\n'There was a very real debate here around particularly I think, the non crime hate incidents and are they taking police time? Actually not directly relevant to the case in hand, but quite a big issue in Essex.\\n\\n'Last year the police looked at over 700 non crime hate incidents. Is that necessarily a good use of time?'\\n\\nMr Hirst insisted that Essex Police was doing well on 'building relationships with all of the communities, whether they be Muslim, Jewish, pro-Palestine, pro-Gazan, whatever it may be or many, many more than that'.\\n\\n'We have that in Essex - that's the focus, no on recording incidents which may or may not be trivial', he added.\\n\\nRoger Hirst told LBC radio today: 'Last year the police looked at over 700 non crime hate incidents. Is that necessarily a good use of time?'\\n\\nAmong those lambasting Essex Police for their probe into Ms Pearson was ex-PM Mr Johnson, who wrote in a post on X: 'This is appalling. How can Starmer's Britain lecture other countries about free speech when an innocent journalist gets a knock on the door - for a tweet?\\n\\n'Our police have their hands full of burglaries and violent crime.

Invited to pose for a photo with lovely peaceful British Friends of Israel on Saturday police refused. Look at this lot smiling with the Jew haters.'\\n\\nBut the picture is from Manchester, meaning the officers do not belong to the Met Police. It is thought there was potentially some confusion between the PTI supporters and those who advocate for Hamas terrorists in the war with Israel.\\n\\nThe complainant, who is not Muslim nor one of the people in the photo, told the Guardian: 'Pearson tweeted something that had nothing to do with Palestine or the London protest. Her description of the two people of colour as Jew haters is racist and inflammatory.\\n\\nAllison Pearson has used X, formerly Twitter, to defend herself and criticise Essex Police\\n\\n'I was concerned about the tweet that Pearson put out last year so much so that I reported it to the police. She could have tweeted an apology stating she was wrong. She didn't.'\\n\\nMs Pearson said she was told the investigation was about a post on social media platform X, and that officers were unable to give her details of the post in question or identify her accuser due to laws governing procedure.\\n\\nShe added: 'This was the most extraordinary overreach and state intrusion into my private life and I don't think I did anything wrong and I think their response was outrageous.'\\n\\nShe said she had no recollection of what she posted but that if it was a year ago, it could have been linked to the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel or pro-Palestine marches shortly afterwards.\"}\n",

Eventually, more than 250 community leaders and citizens in Franklin and Adams counties in Pennsylvania signed on.\\n\\nThis effort - part of a project focused on preventing political violence run by the nonprofit group Urban Rural Action, or UR Action - almost fell apart over an argument over including the word \"insurrection.\"\\n\\nIndeed, words have become contentious on the American political landscape. They turn dinner conversations into battlefields. And they provide politicians with fuel to stoke the flames of polarization.\\n\\nAn anthropologist, I have long studied international political violence and its prevention. More recently, I have done related research in the U.S. that resulted in a 2021 book, \"It Can Happen Here.\"\\n\\nDuring this research, I have found that some words are often understood differently by those on opposite sides of the political aisle. As a result, misunderstandings create tension and sometimes provoke anger.\\n\\nBecoming aware of how and why certain words upset those with different political views, then, is a key step in reducing polarization. Here are five that can trigger Trump supporters and further isolate them from liberal Americans.\\n\\nThe suggestion that Trump incited an insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, at the U.S. Capitol sparked the fight over the wording of the political violence denunciation.\\n\\nJansen later explained to me that she was concerned about widespread accusations that Trump incited violence at the U.S. Capitol - and that, more broadly, \"people on the right are more targeted as hateful and using hate speech.\"\\n\\nChad Collie, another conservative member of the UR Action declaration team, told me in an interview that Trump supporters \"take offense\" when the terms \"incitement\" and \"insurrection\" are used to describe Trump\\'s Jan. 6 rally. In their view, he added, Trump\\'s rally near the White House was a largely peaceful \"protest\" hijacked by a small number of violent people who stormed the Capitol.\\n\\nMore broadly, many Trump voters believe that the president-elect is the victim of \"lawfare,\" meaning efforts to unjustly use laws to attack political opponents.\\n\\nAs evidence, some Trump supporters point to the defeat of both of his impeachments and various criminal court cases brought against Trump, most of which have been paused or dismissed after he won the 2024 election.\\n\\n\"Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\"\\n\\nAttack ads that feature phrases like this don\\'t necessarily win elections.\\n\\nBut gender identity was a nonstop talking point at the dozen or so MAGA events I attended ahead of the election. Speakers there constantly mocked the use of nonbinary pronouns and blasted the \"radical left\" for \"transgender insanity.\" This \"insanity,\" in their view, includes issues such as transgender people using bathrooms that match their gender identity and participating in sports competitions.\\n\\nThe word \"equity\" - along with related terms such as \"diversity,\" \"critical race theory,\" \"social justice,\" \"privilege\" and \"DEI,\" short for \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" - can also anger a Trump supporter.\\n\\nThey associate these words with a \"woke\" or even \"communist\" agenda that they think the \"radical left\" is trying to impose on them.\\n\\nWhile some people think that these terms speak to efforts to recognize that groups of marginalized people, including people of color and women, have long faced discrimination, many Trump supporters think that related \"woke\" policies threaten their free speech and individual and family rights.\\n\\nTrump supporters were called \"deplorables\" by former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.\\n\\nBut my interviews and observations show that no word, not even \"fascist,\" stings Trump supporters as much as being called a \"racist,\" an accusation that is widely used against them.\\n\\nAs Matt Schlapp, the head of the conservative group Conservative Political Action Committee, which runs the annual CPAC conference, laments in a book, \"There is no way to escape its putrid stink.\" The \"racist\" label, Schlapp explains from experience, shames, stigmatizes and makes a person afraid to speak.\\n\\nMore broadly, the use of \"racist\" and related terms plays into many Trump voters\\' perceptions and anger that Democrats are elitist liberals who they think look down upon and even hate them.\\n\\nTrump and Republican influencers frequently play on this resentment. Trump, for example, wore an orange and yellow safety vest as he sat in a garbage truck after Biden referred to them as \"garbage.\" Trump\\'s supporters soon started wearing vests and even garbage bags to his preelection events to show their support for Trump.\\n\\nNo one, however, wore a shirt to a Trump rally emblazoned with the word \"racist.\"\\n\\nAmerica\\'s political division is intertwined with how language - sometimes a single word - can be understood differently by liberals and conservatives and trigger a negative reaction.\\n\\nThis reality has policy implications.\\n\\nFor example, when Philanthropy for Active Civic Engagement, an organization seeking to enhance civic and democratic life, examined perceptions of civic terms starting in 2019, they found that using certain works such as \"equity\" is often perceived as \"liberal and college educated.\" Their survey found that conservatives view terms such as \"diversity,\" \"social justice,\" \"racial equity\" and \"activism\" much more negatively than liberals.\\n\\nThese findings have led organizations that try to decrease political polarization in the U.S. to modify their messaging and more often use terms such as \"unity,\" \"citizens\" and \"liberty,\" which the civics language study found appeals to both liberals and conservatives.\\n\\nWords don\\'t just provoke, then. They can also provide a path forward.\\n\\nAs the saying goes, \"Words are like bees; some create honey, but others leave a sting.\"'}\n",

When I was at school, I went to an Orthodox church and I wasn\\'t traumatized by it at all.\"\\n\\nThe fallout at the primary school led to a comprehensive school in Uusimaa canceling a performance of Handel\\'s \"Messiah\" two days before the concert planned earlier this month because of concerns about references to Christianity in the music.\\n\\nOrganizers had planned for a joint performance of the oratorio at a school by the Finnish Baroque Orchestra and the Helsinki Chamber Choir before school officials canceled it, citing issues with religious references in the music, reported Helsingin Sanomat.\\n\\n\"The atmosphere in the chamber choir and baroque orchestra has been shocked by the decision,\" Laura Kajander, executive director of the Baroque Orchestra, reportedly said, adding that this was the first time such a cancelation occurred. \"If concerts are canceled, it is the children who suffer.\"\\n\\nAbout 80% of Finland\\'s population identifies as Christian, and 10% as Evangelical Christian, according to Joshua Project; 17.1% identify as non-religious, and 1.9% as Muslim.\\n\\nFinnish MP and former government minister Päivi Räsänen said the compensation claims and cancelation defied common sense.\\n\\n\"Compensation payment of 1,500 euros for discrimination when a non-religious child accidentally heard a song about Jesus,\" Räsänen wrote on X on Oct. 31. \"Has the use of common sense disappeared? At the same time, schools celebrate Halloween with witches and zombie characters. How can a song about Jesus be perceived as so dangerous?\"\\n\\nThe MP is facing a third trial after being accused of \"hate speech\" as a Christian for expressing her biblical views on marriage.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court of Finland on April 19 ruled that a third trial would go ahead, as previously reported by Christian Daily International. She had previously been acquitted twice of hate speech but the state prosecutor appealed.\\n\\nTwo previous trials at Helsinki District Court and the Court of Appeal found Räsänen, a grandmother of 11, not guilty of the hate speech charges. A former Minister of the Interior, Räsänen was criminally charged for sharing her Christian views on marriage and sexual ethics in a tweet on X in 2019.\\n\\nShe was also charged in relation to a 2004 pamphlet for her church she wrote about the book of Genesis, stating, \"male and female he created them.\"'}\n",

Committee Experts commended the State on its guide on reporting hate crimes, and asked questions on alleged excessive use of force against minorities by the police and violations of the rights of asylum seekers by the Hellenic Coast Guard.\\n\\nOne Committee Expert welcomed the guide on reporting hate crimes. Were victims of hate crimes made aware of this guide?\\n\\nBakri Sidiki Diaby, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said there had been several allegations of excessive use of force against minorities by the police. How was the State party ensuring that all allegations were properly investigated, perpetrators punished, and victims granted reparations?\\n\\nMr. Diaby said that since March 2020, a significant deterioration had been noted in the security of persons from third countries seeking asylum in the east of Greece. There had been reports of summary forced return, secret detention, confiscation of personal effects, and intrusive searches. What steps had been taken to investigate these alleged violations of human rights and to prevent such violations?\\n\\nIntroducing the report, Aikaterini Patsogianni, Secretary General of Equality and Human Rights, Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family Affairs of Greece and head of the delegation, said that, in the fight against racism, police authorities had developed standards and guidance in areas such as training and capacity building of law enforcement, improved recording and collection of data on hate crimes, as well as cooperation between law enforcement and civil society organizations, and ways to address underreporting.\\n\\nThe delegation said one key initiative of the national action plan against racism and intolerance was the guide for victims on reporting hate crimes, which had been translated into nine languages and published online. Several training activities had been held to improve State authorities\\' response to hate crimes.\\n\\nPolice personnel were obliged to respect human rights and perform their duties based on respect for individuals, the delegation said. Over 1,000 cases of police misdemeanours had been conveyed to the Ombudsman, and around 660 disciplinary sanctions had been implemented.\\n\\nThe delegation said the Hellenic Coast Guard\\'s practices followed international law. Protecting human life at sea and aiding those in distress, without any form of discrimination, was the highest duty of the Coast Guard. All allegations of pushbacks were appropriately investigated by monitoring bodies. The Coast Guard had saved and continued to save thousands of lives at sea. From 2013, Coast Guard officers had been trained in basic human rights principles.\\n\\nIn concluding remarks, Mr. Diaby thanked the delegation for the dialogue, which had been intensive, fruitful, frank and necessary. The questions raised by the Committee aimed to assess progress in the implementation of the Convention to help the Committee to develop recommendations that were helpful to Greece.\\n\\nIn his concluding remarks, Ioannis Ghikas, Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said the dialogue had been intense but constructive, identifying issues that the State party needed to address. The State was proud of the progress it had made since the last review, including in protecting the rights of asylum seekers and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons.\\n\\nThe delegation of Greece consisted of representatives of the Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family Affairs; Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Ministry of Interior; Ministry of Education, Religious Affairs and Sports; Ministry of Health; Ministry of Citizen Protection; Ministry of Labour and Social Security; Ministry of Justice; Ministry of Migration and Asylum; Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Insular Policy; Hellenic Labour Inspectorate; Presidency of the Government; and the Permanent Mission of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva.\\n\\nThe Committee will issue its concluding observations on the report of Greece after the conclusion of its one hundred and fourteenthOpens in new window session on 13 December. The programme of work and other documents related to the session can be found hereOpens in new window. Summaries of the public meetings of the Committee can be found here, while webcasts of the public meetings can be found hereOpens in new window.\\n\\nThe Committee will next meet in public on Wednesday, 4 December at 3 p.m. to consider the combined eighth and ninth periodic report of Kenya (CERD/C/KEN/8-9Opens in new window).\\n\\nReport\\n\\nThe Committee has before it the combined twenty-third and twenty-fourth periodic report of Greece (CERD/C/GRC/23-24Opens in new window).\\n\\nPresentation of Report\\n\\nIOANNIS GHIKAS, Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said the dialogue would highlight the progress Greece had made. The State party had taken significant initiatives to combat racial discrimination, including by implementing the national action plan on preventing racism and intolerance, laws combatting hate speech, and training programmes for law enforcement officials. The State party had also adopted a national action plan on preventing anti-Semitism and had made efforts to promote the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, including by implementing legislation on same-sex marriage.\\n\\nProgress had been made despite the decade-long economic crisis that Greece had been facing. The racist \"Golden Dawn\" organization had been banned from participating in political activities and its leaders had been imprisoned. Civil society continued to support the State party\\'s efforts to prevent racism and intolerance. There was much work to be done, but Greece was committed to addressing the issues it faced, and looked forward to the recommendations of the Committee.\\n\\nAIKATERINI PATSOGIANNI, Secretary General of Equality and Human Rights, Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family Affairs of Greece and head of the delegation, said that since the last review, Greece had been advancing toward long-term sustainable economic progress, supporting its human rights and anti-racism framework. In the fight against racism, police authorities had developed standards and guidance in areas such as training and capacity building of law enforcement, improved recording and collection of data on hate crimes, as well as cooperation between law enforcement and civil society organizations, and ways to address underreporting. The judicial system responded to organizations that exploited the economic crisis and the resulting fractures to the social fabric to commit criminal racist acts, while the legislature took measures to protect and safeguard the democratic electoral process from such criminal organizations.\\n\\nThe National Council against Racism and Intolerance, in which independent bodies also participated, adopted its first national action plan in December 2020. Efforts for the second action plan were underway, with funding secured for a results-driven agenda. In this regard, the State party was ready to work with relevant stakeholders, including the Racist Violence Recording Network.\\n\\nGreece was actively implementing the National Strategy on the Roma 2021-2030, guided by the principle of \"for the Roma, with the Roma.\" Key committees, including the independent Roma Forum, were fully operational. All available European Union funding was used to enhance the Roma\\'s employment, education, healthcare and housing.\\n\\nOn migration, modernised reception facilities ensured dignified conditions and targeted care for vulnerable groups, while a robust system supported unaccompanied minors. The Asylum Service had significantly improved in efficiency. The \"HELIOS\" project and legal reforms promoted integration and labour market access. Enhanced international cooperation also provided pathways for organised, legal migration.\\n\\nBorder protection was carried out in line with domestic, European and international law. Protecting human life at sea and aiding those in distress, without any form of discrimination, was the highest duty of the Hellenic Coast Guard. Allegations of violations of the principle of non-refoulement were inconsistent with the operational activities of the competent agencies. The State had put in place a multi-level policy for the effective monitoring of fundamental rights. The Hellenic Coast Guard had saved and continued to save thousands of lives at sea.\\n\\nGreece had ratified International Labour Organization Convention 190 to create a work environment free from violence and harassment. Public authorities detected and protected all trafficking victims, without discrimination, in line with the principles of the Office of the National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings and the National Referral Mechanism.\\n\\nInclusive education was promoted through various initiatives and teacher training programmes. Key efforts included the \"Active Citizens\\' Actions\" curriculum supporting the Sustainable Development Goals, a 2023 anti-bullying law with a reporting platform, a mobile phone ban to reduce cyberbullying, and the introduction of \"Digital School\" and \"Skills Lab\" to enhance digital learning.\\n\\nThe State party had also established an independent Committee of Deontology, aimed at countering all types of expression in printed and electronic media that incited, promoted, spread or justified violence, hatred or discriminatory speech. Human rights education, training and awareness-raising activities, including for law enforcement personnel and members of the judiciary, remained top priorities.\\n\\nQuestions by a Committee Expert\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, thanked Greece for supporting the candidacy of Greek Expert Stamatia Stavrinaki to the Committee, who made remarkable contributions to its work.\\n\\nCould the delegation provide information on the ethnic makeup of the population and of asylum seekers and refugees living in the State party? The Committee was concerned by the general lack of disaggregated data on racial discrimination. What measures were in place to implement a comprehensive data collection system?\\n\\nWhat measures had the State party taken to address excessive use of force by the police? There had been several allegations of such excessive use of force against minorities. How was the State party ensuring that all allegations were properly investigated, perpetrators punished, and victims granted reparations?\\n\\nThere was a limited number of convictions for cases involving racial discrimination and official data on cases reported to the police was not accessible to the public. The Committee was concerned that the new anti-racist law was not fully in line with the requirements of article four of the Convention as it did not criminalise the dissemination of ideas of racial superiority or prohibit racist organizations. What measures were in place to revise legislation to ensure that all incitement to racial, ethnic and religious hatred was criminalised and that perpetrators were punished? How had the police\\'s capacity to investigate racist crimes and to combat racist violence been increased? State services reportedly did not provide appropriate, timely support to victims of racist violence, who relied on support from civil society. Was a referral system for victims to State services being developed?\\n\\nOver the reporting period, there had been 89 reported cases of racism targeting asylum seekers and refugees. The Committee welcomed the various legislative measures undertaken to address racism. Were there gaps in the implementation of legislation on racism? Was there a media regulatory body that held journalists to account when they disseminated racist notions?\\n\\nWas the State party drafting a new national action plan to combat racism and intolerance? What results had the last action plan achieved? The National Council against Racism and Intolerance had been reactivated in 2024. What measures were in place to ensure that the Council could work effectively?\\n\\nWhy had there been delays in the registration of civil society organizations claiming to have minority status? Some minority associations had been dissolved; could the delegation comment on this?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece did not collect statistical data based on race and religious affiliations due to its protection of the right to privacy. Statistical data was collected on specific categories of beneficiaries of State policies, such as policies for the Roma. Data was also collected on the demographics of prison inmates, and on migrants, asylum seekers and refugees according to European Union regulations. A unified information system for reception and asylum was being developed. Data on migrants\\' gender, ethnicity and religion was collected.\\n\\nAfter 2015, there was an amendment to legislation concerning the punishment of hate crimes that facilitated the investigation and prosecution of cases by eliminating the need to prove the standard of \"hate\". Data from the judiciary and the Public Prosecutor showed that there had been better implementation of hate crime legislation in recent years. The State party also had legislation on hate speech and incitement to hatred that addressed speech inciting racial superiority.\\n\\n\"Golden Dawn\" was not allowed to participate in elections and State funding to it had been suspended. All political parties that acted as proxies for persons who had committed racist hate crimes were prohibited, and on this basis two political parties had recently been banned from participating in elections.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said human rights defenders were sometimes accused and condemned without having the opportunity to defend themselves. Did the State party intend to adopt special legislation to protect human rights defenders? Several dozens of cases of refoulement involving Greece had been examined by the European Court of Human Rights. Were border police trained on the handling of migrants? What aid had been provided to victims of police violence?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said that although the European Union directive on victim support had been incorporated into national legislation, there were allegations that the directive was not sufficiently applied, leading to impunity for perpetrators of racist acts. How did the State party collect data on foreign nationals in the prison system? What recommendations had been provided by the Racist Violence Reporting Network to the State and had these been implemented?\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert asked about the effectiveness of State policies. How many of the cases of police misconduct reported had resulted in sanctions? How many committees reviewing journalistic ethics had members of racial minority groups?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece had permitted the reopening of domestic court proceedings after decisions on three cases by the European Court of Human Rights. A committee of independent experts had been established to develop strategies for the implementation of the European Court\\'s decisions.\\n\\nPolice personnel were obliged to respect human rights and perform their duties based on respect for individuals. They needed to avoid prejudice based on distinguishing characteristics. The Hellenic Police transmitted relevant information to an independent Ombudsman concerning cases involving discrimination. Over 1,000 cases of police misdemeanours had been conveyed to the Ombudsman, and around 660 disciplinary sanctions had been implemented. Several cases related to racist actions by the police.\\n\\nThe law on audiovisual media services prohibited the dissemination of hate speech based on race and other characteristics. The National Media Advisory Authority had the competence to impose sanctions for disseminating hate speech through online and offline media. All print and online media needed to meet requirements related to the Journalistic Code of Ethics, which included prohibitions of hate speech. The Journalistic Ethics Committee was mandated to investigate all allegations of discriminatory speech. Its members were not appointed based on their ethnicity or sex but were journalists and academics.\\n\\nIn Greece, persons with low income could apply for free legal aid. Legal aid was also provided to victims in trafficking cases and to female victims of violence. Measures were in place to protect victims from secondary victimisation in legal proceedings. All victims were informed of their rights, including the right to compensation.\\n\\nThe Greek legislative framework did not have a specific law for the protection of human rights defenders; all persons were equal before the law.\\n\\nPrivate funding of political parties was strictly forbidden in Greece. Only State funding was legal for political parties. This was why State funding had been suspended for parties that engaged in hate crimes and hate speech.\\n\\nQuestions by a Committee Expert\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said not all incidents of racism were reported by victims, allegedly due to a lack of confidence in the authorities. What measures were in place to strengthen confidence in the justice system among citizens? Did the State party intend to establish an efficient data collection system on racist violence? How would it promote access to justice for victims of racial discrimination? How many complaints of racist hate speech and hate crimes had been received by the State and how many perpetrators had been prosecuted? In how many court cases had the Convention been cited? What measures had the State party taken to encourage the participation of civil society in the implementation of the Convention? Racism continued to be prevalent in the Attica region and in centres where refugees and asylum seekers were located. Did the State party intend to accept the Committee\\'s communications procedure?\\n\\nDiscrimination against minorities by authorities persisted. What recent educational initiatives had been implemented to combat intolerance and prejudice and promote intercultural dialogue? The State party had received the Global Education Award for establishing the Skills Lab, which promoted ethnic tolerance. Was this implemented in all regions of the State party and at all levels?\\n\\nThe Committee commended the State party for its efforts to create memorials of the Holocaust. There were 158 attacks based on religion recorded in 2023. What measures were in place to ensure efficient investigations of these incidents and to develop protection measures? There had also been an increase in cases of vandalism of religious sites and profanation in recent years. What measures were in place to put an end to these practices?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the police code of conduct required police to act with empathy toward vulnerable people. The State party collected data on hate speech and hate crimes, including data on racially motivated crimes.\\n\\nIn Greek prisons, data was collected on nationality. Foreigners from 101 nationalities made up 50 per cent of the prison population. These were persons who were convicted and serving these sentences in Greek prisons. Greece was on the crossroads of many routes, and many people in prisons in Greece were engaged in cross-border criminal activity.\\n\\nThe Ombudsperson received discrimination complaints. Racial discrimination complaints made up seven per cent of complaints received in 2023, up from two per cent in 2022. The labour inspectorate examined complaints of workplace discrimination. The inspectorate was empowered to instigate administrative sanctions. Three cases it investigated in 2023 involved discrimination on the grounds of nationality.\\n\\nThe police had established specialised departments to address violent hate crimes and hate speech and provide support to victims in Attica and the Eastern Aegean region. A hotline and online form for reporting hate crimes had been implemented, and several campaigns were underway on online hate speech. The police force was cooperating with civil society, which provided training to upgrade the capacities of police staff.\\n\\nThe Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure had been revised to make them more victim centred. Courts had been redistributed to improve citizens\\' access across the State. Domestic violence legislation had also been modernised.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, asked for statistics on victims of discrimination who had benefitted from free legal aid. There was a large gap between the records of racist violence of the Racist Violence Reporting NetworkOpens in new window and the Government. Why was this? On what basis was the second national action plan on addressing racism being devised?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said that it was quite shocking that 50 per cent of prisoners in Greece were non-nationals.\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert said that the State\\'s regulations on the provision of legal aid appeared to limit access to it. Would it consider implementing a system of reviewing all requests for legal aid, regardless of the type of crime?\\n\\nA Committee Expert asked whether the labour inspectorate assigned fines for workplace discrimination. Why were non-nationals in Attica most impacted by racist crimes? How did the State party apply the recommendations of the Racist Violence Reporting Network? The Expert welcomed the guide on reporting hate crimes. Were victims made aware of this guide?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the national action plan against racism and intolerance focused on addressing hate crimes, empowering minorities, and eliminating discrimination based on various characteristics. One key initiative was the guide for victims on reporting hate crimes, which had been translated into nine languages and distributed to migrant reception centres and published online. Several training activities had been held to improve State authorities\\' response to hate crimes.\\n\\nThe National Council against Racism and Intolerance had held meetings with civil society to develop the second national action plan on addressing racism and intolerance. It had secured funding to improve victims\\' access to State services. The Council would review the Committee\\'s recommendations and include them in the second national action plan, which would focus on strengthening data collection on hate crimes and developing more services for victims.\\n\\nThe Skills Lab initiative had been piloted nationwide. New curricula promoted human rights education and intercultural communication. Training courses were offered for teachers on human rights and inclusion. A digital platform for reporting school bullying and violence had been launched. As of April 2024, over 700 reports had been received, 10 per cent of which related to racism.\\n\\nVarious actions had been taken to provide education about the Holocaust. Greece was one of the first countries to return the property of victims of the Holocaust. The State collected data on vandalism of religious sites. In 2015, 147 cases were recorded.\\n\\nThe procedure for applying for free legal aid was very simple. Applicants needed only to supply documents proving that they had low income. Victims of almost all crimes could apply for this aid. Lawyers could be appointed for defendants in serious crimes with punishments of five years imprisonment or more.\\n\\nOn some occasions, victims of racist violence went to the Racist Violence Reporting Network but not to public authorities. In 2023, 115 cases had been opened by authorities. There was not a big gap between the number of cases collected by authorities and by the Network. More than half of the population lived in Attica. This was why most racist crimes were reported in this region.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said 18 per cent of asylum camp residents did not enjoy basic material conditions, including food and financial assistance. There were only 29 doctors, 92 nurses and 69 interpreters deployed across all the camps, some of which had more than 1,000 residents. What measures were in place to improve the situation in the camps and ensure that the detention of foreign nationals was only done as a last resort? How was the State party ensuring access to interpretation services for foreign nationals? What efforts had been made to develop a statelessness establishment procedure? How was the State party addressing barriers to refugees accessing official documents?\\n\\nWhat steps had been taken to investigate alleged violations of human rights in the context of border management and to prevent such violations? Was there regular independent surveillance of border forces and efforts to strengthen their capacity? Since March 2020, a significant deterioration had been noted in the security and safety of persons from third countries seeking asylum in the east of Greece. There had been reports of summary forced return of persons who had entered from Türkiye, secret detention without sufficient safeguards, confiscation of personal effects, and intrusive searches. There were also reports of private individuals towing and removing engines from asylum seekers\\' boats, and assisting officials in carrying out forced returns.\\n\\nGreece had not signed the statelessness convention and the Presidential decree on the statelessness determination procedure had not been promulgated. Around 3,740 people in Greece had stated that they had no nationality. What measures would the State party take to better address the issue of statelessness?\\n\\nThe Committee had previously expressed concern regarding low salaries and long working hours for migrant workers, particularly in the agricultural sector. What measures were in place to improve the situation of migrant workers? Was there a safe and accessible way of filing complaints related to workplace discrimination? What measures were in place to support undocumented migrants and protect them from trafficking and forced labour?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said seminars on human rights and diversity had been provided for over 1,600 public servants. Seminars had been held on the Holocaust for members of the Orthodox Church of Greece and on the basic principles of Islam for prison officers. Over 160 integrity advisors had also been trained and certified to support integrity in the public service. The national school of the judiciary provided mandatory training on human rights, gender-based violence and other topics. In 2024, 15 seminars had been planned for judges and 12 for court staff.\\n\\nGreece directly implemented the Convention in domestic law, which was why court decisions did not directly reference the Convention.\\n\\nIf infringements of labour laws were found, labour inspectors could impose administrative sanctions and fines, and file serious cases of non-compliance with the Prosecutor.\\n\\nRefugee children could enrol in reception classes without documentation. Language classes were offered for students after school hours. Educational guides assisted teachers in making refugee students feel welcome and safe.\\n\\nGreece was facing challenges with the arrival of third country nationals seeking to enter Europe through Türkiye. It had accelerated asylum procedures through the digitisation of asylum procedures. Health care insurance and tax identification numbers were provided to asylum seekers, who could access employment and healthcare throughout the State.\\n\\nOne of the main priorities of Greece\\'s migration policy was to improve asylum conditions. Case managers carried out rapid assessments of new arrivals\\' needs. Vulnerable persons were provided with specialised protection. More interpreters were being provided in collaboration with various public and private organizations and civil society. The \"HELIOS\" integration system offered support to refugees to access the labour market, health and education. Another initiative was specifically focused on providing language, vocational and intercultural training to refugees seeking to enter the job market.\\n\\nMigration legislation had been amended to reduce the number of migrants in informal employment. An agreement had been reached with Egypt on the provision of temporary employment to Egyptian citizens in the agricultural sector. An agreement was also reached with Bangladeshi citizens to improve access to formal employment. These agreements reenforced legal pathways to migration.\\n\\nThe average time taken to process asylum applications was now 100 days; formerly processing took years. Greece collaborated with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to develop a new system of naturalisation that was fairer for refugees and stateless persons. Around 55 applications for Greek citizenship had been received; only 16 were still pending, citizenship had been granted for the rest.\\n\\nPolice had circulated guidelines on the protection of the fundamental rights of refugees arriving in the State. No third country national was to be returned until their asylum application had been processed.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said violence and excessive use of force had been reported in asylum centres. Could the delegation comment on this? Mr. Diaby congratulated the State party on efforts to formalise the status of stateless persons. Did the State party intend to ratify the statelessness convention? How was the State party responding to racist incidents in sport?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert asked about the results of the human rights education strategies implemented by the State.\\n\\nFAITH DIKELEDI PANSY TLAKULA, Committee Expert and Follow-Up Rapporteur, said the Committee had previously recommended that the State party provide training to teachers on providing education to migrant children, ensure individual assessment of asylum applications, and protect against refoulement. What efforts had been made to improve migrants\\' access to asylum procedures and education?\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert said that in recent years, there had been a rise in hate speech across the world, including in Greece. What measures were in place to tackle racist hate speech targeting migrants and minorities, and xenophobia?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the State was proud of improvements that had been made in the situation on the State\\'s islands. The Hellenic Coast Guard\\'s practices followed international law. All allegations of pushbacks were appropriately investigated by monitoring bodies. From 2015 to the present, the Coast Guard had rescued over 250,000 persons at sea. From 2013, Coast Guard officers had been trained in basic human rights principles.\\n\\nGreece was stepping up efforts to prevent trafficking in persons through legal and policy instruments. The national action plan on trafficking in persons was being updated to address financial and labour exploitation. The State party had organised seminars and created standards on the financial aspects of these crimes. New forms of exploitation had been added to legislation. Accommodation, medical care and legal counselling were provided to victims of trafficking in persons. A leaflet on human trafficking had been produced in several languages.\\n\\nThe State party was prioritising the ratification of International Labour Organization convention 29 on forced labour. This process was expected to be completed soon. A plan for the prevention of labour exploitation was formulated by the State each year and preventative inspections were carried out twice a year in vulnerable sectors. Employees could file complaints through an online anonymous complaints service, by email or a telephone hotline. The State provided migrant workers with information about their rights.\\n\\nA programme was in place to increase access to medical staff in asylum centres through measures such as the temporary transfer of medical personnel. Around 16,200 refugee students from 70 different countries were enrolled in Greek educational institutions. Case managers trained in the best interests of the child monitored age assessment procedures, which would soon be harmonised across all European Union Member States.\\n\\nGreece had ratified the regional conventions on safety in sport matches and had implemented legislation that prohibited banners at sporting matches with racist or sexist content.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said Greece only formally recognised one minority, Thrace Muslims. Why were other minority groups not recognised as minorities? What data was collected on minorities? How well represented was the Muslim minority in public bodies and in elected roles at national and local levels?\\n\\nWhat outcomes had been achieved by the last national strategy on the inclusion of the Roma and what progress had been made in implementing the current strategy? Were the Roma consulted about policies and strategies that affected them? Roma people reportedly continued to be victims of discrimination in Greece when trying to access healthcare, housing and employment. Many Roma people lived below the poverty threshold and struggled to access basic services. What measures were in place to ensure equal access for Roma children to education and schooling? What measures were in place to improve access to paid employment and quality healthcare for the Roma? Roma often lacked access to heating, running water and toilets. How was the State party preventing forced evictions and fines for illegal construction? Roma people faced long, costly judicial procedures to acquire Greek nationality. How was the State party promoting their access to nationality?\\n\\nThe Committee noted the adoption of several laws and the national strategy in favour of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. However, this community continued to be subjected to discrimination in schools and public services. What measures were in place to tackle such discrimination? What results had the national strategy achieved?\\n\\nThere were reports of migrant women, including pregnant women, having been assaulted by Greek Coast Guards. Greece had the highest rate of femicide in Europe. What measures were in place to address violence against women?\\n\\nWhat statistics did the State party have on people of African descent and their integration in public life? What activities had been undertaken as part of the International Decade for People of African Descent? How was the State party combatting the multiple forms of discrimination faced by this group? What measures were in place to implement the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action? Was there a formal mechanism in place to assess its implementation?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the term \"minority\" in Greece was understood under stricter criteria than those of the Committee. The State party respected the principle of self-identification. Groups of people who were not recognised as a minority enjoyed all rights under the Convention. Four members of the Hellenic Parliament were Muslims, and more than 100 Muslims had been elected to public bodies.\\n\\nThe Roma had expressed the will not to be considered as an ethnic minority. Authorities paid particular attention to this vulnerable group. The State had made the civil registry process easier and more efficient for the Roma. The previous strategy on Roma inclusion provided specific interventions to address early school dropouts and support access to health and housing. Implementation of this strategy was independently reviewed. There were also 85 local action plans on Roma support elaborated with the Roma population. There was an open, independent consultation platform with 13 Roma organizations that met every three months to devise strategies for Roma inclusion.\\n\\nRoma people were eligible for all State welfare benefits. The State party was promoting the Roma\\'s participation in education and the labour market. The public employment service implemented targeted programmes for the Roma, such as 15,000-euro subsidies for Roma who started a business and training and certification in technical jobs.\\n\\nThe Government had taken measures to facilitate the inclusion of Roma children in education. Psychosocial support was provided to vulnerable students in schools. Roma children could be enrolled in schools without official documentation. Teacher training programmes were provided on combatting early school dropouts and supporting Roma children.\\n\\nThe State party did not have records of complaints against Coast Guard officials regarding sexual assault of pregnant women. This year, there had been 12 victims of femicide. The State party had ratified the Istanbul Convention and was collecting data on violence against women and conducting training in schools to raise awareness of the issue. There was a large network of structures for supporting women victims, who had access to emergency accommodation.\\n\\nThe national strategy on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons aimed to combat discrimination and promote equality for these people. All ministries carried out actions supporting these people.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said there were gaps between policies for the Roma and practices. What was the size of the Roma population? What were the causes of femicides in the State party and the ethnic origins of the victims? Had the State party considered making a law on femicide?\\n\\nA Committee Expert said Roma children were being segregated in Greek schools. How many Roma children were participating in and graduating from inclusive public education?\\n\\nFAITH DIKELEDI PANSY TLAKULA, Committee Expert and Follow-Up Rapporteur, said the Committee had previously expressed concern about the poor working conditions of migrant workers in the agricultural sector and the informal economy. What investigations had been carried out into the exploitation of migrant workers and what compensation was provided to victims? Were employers who imposed abusive labour conditions subjected to criminal sanctions? What training was provided to labour inspectors on identifying victims of human trafficking?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said Greece\\'s efforts to preserve its historical monuments were commendable.\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece was home to a vibrant community of people of African descent, many of whom held leading roles in civil society and public organizations. Greece fully supported the pending General Assembly resolution to declare a second International Decade for People of African DescentOpens in new window. The National Council against Racism and Intolerance was implementing measures to support the rights of people of African descent.\\n\\nThere were 120,000 Roma people in Greece, 20,000 of whom received guaranteed minimum income support. To encourage school attendance, families whose children did not attend school did not receive welfare benefits. Investments had been made to improve housing infrastructure in Roma communities.\\n\\nAround 1,600 labour inspections were carried out this year and fines were issued in around 700 cases. Twenty cases had been reported to the Public Prosecutor regarding potential victims of trafficking in persons. Standards had been developed for seasonal housing for migrant workers. The labour inspectorate\\'s staff had been increased recently. All inspectors participated in training on preventing and identifying human trafficking.\\n\\nClosing Remarks\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, thanked the delegation for the dialogue, which had been intensive, fruitful, frank and necessary. The questions raised by the Committee aimed to assess progress in the implementation of the Convention to help the Committee to develop recommendations that were helpful to Greece.\\n\\nIOANNIS GHIKAS, Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said the dialogue had been intense but constructive, identifying issues that the State party needed to address. Greece was proud of the Greek Committee Expert Stamatia Stavrinaki, who was an excellent representative of the tradition of human rights scholarship in Greece. The strong representation of women in the delegation was a representation of the reality in Greece, where promoting women\\'s representation was a high priority. The State was proud of the progress it had made since the last review, including in protecting the rights of asylum seekers and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons.'}\n",

Her students\\' comments and questions opened her eyes to the complexities of racialization within the school system. She recalls the challenges of navigating these moments, feeling the weight of her responsibility as an educator to address these issues thoughtfully.\\n\\nChavez-Moreno\\'s new book, \"How Schools Make Race: Teaching Latinx Racialization in America,\" draws from these formative experiences, blending them with years of academic research to unpack how schools subtly shape racial identities, especially for Latinx students.\\n\\nThe book addresses sensitive issues, like the limitations placed on teachers in discussing race openly, the diversity (or lack thereof) within bilingual teaching staff, and the challenges faced by Latinx students in predominantly white school systems.\\n\\nChavez-Moreno\\'s decision to avoid naming specific schools or states in her research highlights the universal nature of racialization in education. As she points out, the underlying process of racial identity formation is a nationwide phenomenon, not confined to any particular region. This broad perspective underscores the pervasiveness of racialization in shaping students\\' identities, an issue Chavez-Moreno believes requires urgent attention from educators, administrators, and policymakers alike.\\n\\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nThis book essentially covers the time when Donald Trump was elected president in 2016 and fast forward to now. The book is out and we live in a reality where Trump will be president again. So I simply want to ask you, what does the re-election of Donald Trump mean for this type of research and future work?\\n\\nI\\'m not really sure how I could answer that because it\\'s still... I was walking yesterday, and I was trying to process, thinking, \"I can\\'t believe this is happening again and worse.\" It\\'s not going to be the same. It\\'s going to be worse. I really don\\'t know how to answer that, besides the fact that, like you mentioned, I was in classrooms in a Midwest swing state [in 2016] and heard things like students saying, \"Miss, I\\'m not coming tomorrow; I\\'m going to be deported.\" It\\'s interesting because last week, I was in Arizona doing a research study, and exactly the same phrase was used. So, it\\'s deeply saddening, and I haven\\'t fully processed it.\\n\\nCould I add, though, being in the classrooms in Arizona versus being in the classrooms in the previous study in the Midwestern state, I feel like, can I go back to the other classrooms? Because in Arizona, teachers were basically forbidden. One of the teachers told me we were muzzled to talk to our students about the election. So there was a lot of fear, and that fear wasn\\'t addressed, so there was this stifling silence in the schools.\\n\\nWhen I began reading the book, I thought this was going to be a message to teachers and their pedagogy and what things should and shouldn\\'t be done in the classroom. But I found that your book isn\\'t just about teacher pedagogy but rather how institutions shape these racial identities and social structures.\\n\\nThanks for noticing that the book isn\\'t trying to dictate what teachers should or shouldn\\'t do. It is about showing how, often in hidden ways, schooling institutions create these ideas about racial categories. But to clarify, I\\'m less focused on individual identity formation and more on the formation of groups. That\\'s a key distinction.\\n\\nIn the book, you spend a significant portion defining terms like race, ethnicity and racialization. Why was it necessary to invest so much time in clarification?\\n\\nThat\\'s kind of the business of academia. As scholars, we need to explain what we mean by terms instead of assuming shared understanding. For example, if I use the term \"Latinx\" without explanation, readers might misinterpret its meaning. Being explicit about concepts helps guide understanding, especially when dealing with theory. It\\'s interesting that you notice that because that\\'s actually something that I also advocate in my other work, for scholars to be clear about how they conceptualize specific terms and concepts.\\n\\n\"I was in classrooms in a Midwest swing state [in 2016] and heard things like students saying, \"Miss, I\\'m not coming tomorrow; I\\'m going to be deported.\" It\\'s interesting because last week, I was in Arizona doing a research study, and exactly the same phrase was used.\"\\n\\nIn the book, you mentioned using \"Latinx\" for political reasons.\\n\\nSo, I first heard Latinx when I was a doctoral student, and I liked it because I saw it as a gift from the queer and trans communities to challenge the gender binary and patriarchy. As time went on, I started hearing people use \"Latine,\" but the reasons I heard for using \"Latine\" weren\\'t very appealing to me. As I kept reading other authors and their interpretations of the \"X\" in Latinx, I came across Claudia Milian\\'s book \"LatinX.\" In that book, she mentions that one of the meanings of the \"X\" could be crossing out \"Latin,\" a word rooted in colonialism and Europe. I loved that idea.\\n\\nThis distinction is crucial because racialization is highly context-specific. For example, in Guatemala, there is a racialized group called Ladino (not Latino). If someone who identifies as Ladino in Guatemala moves to the U.S., that label doesn\\'t translate or hold the same meaning here. Similarly, someone from Latin America identifying as \"Latino\" might find that the U.S. context racializes the term differently, and it doesn\\'t carry the same understanding.\\n\\nSo, when I use \"Latinx,\" it signals to my readers that I\\'m talking about a racialized group within the specific context of the U.S., not about Latin Americans as a whole. That\\'s why the \"X\" is meaningful -- it serves as a marker of this distinction.\\n\\nDoes your use of \"Latinx\" come up in your teaching?\\n\\nOh, definitely. I\\'ve noticed a trend among my students where they often use \"Latine,\" and they\\'re curious about why I use \"Latinx.\" I explain my reasons to them, but I make it clear: I\\'m not trying to convince or convert them to use \"Latinx.\" I tell them, \"This is why I use it, but it\\'s totally fine if you choose to use something else in your work.\" It\\'s something I bring up to share my perspective, but I emphasize that they\\'re free to have their own reasons and use whichever term they prefer.\\n\\nYou obviously speak to educators and students but something I found particularly interesting is that you also address parents. I see this text as not only essential for educators but also potentially valuable for parents. What should parents know about how schools shape racial identities?\\n\\nI did interview parents for the study, and I noticed that parents had different ideas about what should be taught in schools -- which, of course, isn\\'t surprising. But for teachers to engage in this kind of work, there needs to be community support and parents are a key part of that community. It\\'s crucial to remember their role in supporting teachers as they undertake this work. By \"this type of work,\" I mean helping students develop critical racial consciousness and addressing questions about race explicitly. Schools, as I argue in the book, already teach about race in implicit ways. However, we must also engage with race explicitly, advancing anti-racist thinking and critically examining race as a construct. Parents\\' support is essential in fostering this kind of education.\\n\\nHow can parents advocate for a more equitable and inclusive education for their children?\\n\\nOne of the things I noticed in my study was a meeting, maybe \"Town Hall\" is too formal a term, between parents, students, and teachers of the bilingual program. They met on a Saturday morning to discuss the program\\'s history, importance and challenges, as well as to hear from both students and parents. What struck me most was that parents were very adamant about teachers needing to be 100% bilingual and highly proficient in Spanish. Their focus was entirely on language proficiency. I also heard similar sentiments from students I interviewed, some of whom chose not to participate in the program. For example, one student said, \"I don\\'t want to be in the program because my teacher pollutes my Spanish.\"\\n\\nI mention this example because, during that meeting, no parent brought up the importance of teachers developing students\\' critical consciousness. The focus was solely on language -- ensuring students learned English and spoke perfect Spanish. I think this emphasis stems from a stigma about students being viewed as \"pocho\" or not having perfect Spanish.\\n\\nTo answer your question about how parents can advocate, they should show up at these meetings and expand the conversation. Of course, they can express the importance of bilingualism, but they should also emphasize the need for teachers to develop student awareness of societal injustices and their critical consciousness. That would be a significant step forward.\\n\\nI was also intrigued by the makeup of the teachers you chose, or who were selected, and the very interesting group of people that emerged. One seemed almost overtly racist, and it was fascinating to see how race shaped their perspective. The gender makeup of the educators was also notable.\\n\\nOne of the things I found interesting was the very small number of Latino, Latina or Latinx teachers in the program. The program had 15 teachers across two schools that I observed. Not all of them participated in the study, but I believe it was around 12 or 13 who did. However, the majority of the teachers were white or self-identified as white, which stood out to me. It was notable that, in a bilingual program in a Midwestern state, the teaching staff was still predominantly white. I say \"still\" because this pattern was consistent with what I observed outside the program as well.\\n\\nAnother interesting point was who was leading lessons that challenged racism and addressed social justice. As I mentioned, there were very few Latinx teachers in my study, so I didn\\'t have many opportunities to observe whether they would approach these topics differently. There was also an immigrant teacher from Spain who incorporated some of these ideas in their classroom.\\n\\nThis study wasn\\'t designed to assess whether white teachers are more critically conscious than Latinx teachers. What I did notice, in terms of patterns, was that the teachers leading critical lessons were mostly white. That\\'s why I don\\'t find that particular observation especially compelling.\\n\\nWhy did you avoid naming specific schools or states in the book?\\n\\nThere are very few bilingual programs at the secondary level, especially in middle and high schools. That\\'s why I didn\\'t name the state but it\\'s also something I realized after the fact. I also appreciate that choice because I wasn\\'t just focusing on one specific place; I\\'m talking about something that happens in schools everywhere. All schools in the U.S., in my opinion, contribute to shaping ideas about race. Because schools are central in our racialized society, they maintain and sometimes challenge ideas about race. They can reinforce these ideas or offer new perspectives, but they shape how we think about racial groups. So, while I don\\'t specify the state, school or city, I wanted to provide an example that helps us think about how this process works more broadly. It may not look exactly the same in every place, but if we think about how schools make race, it\\'s helpful to recognize that this isn\\'t just something that happens in one city. It could be anywhere in the U.S.\\n\\nWould that at all be influenced by the fact that, to me, it\\'s interesting you say this can happen anywhere in the U.S., regardless of the specific makeup of a city or state? The immediate question that comes to mind is that not all cities and states are the same, and not all educators have the same demographic makeup. So, I\\'m kind of challenging that idea: what does it say about the institutions pushing for a more diverse group of educators and students? When you say this can happen anywhere, does that mean the work being done to increase diversity has a broader significance?\\n\\nWhat I mean by saying this can happen anywhere is not that the specifics are the same, but that the process of racialization happens everywhere. The making of race and the teaching of race occur everywhere. It\\'s not about the particulars; it\\'s about the broader process. I assume we live in a racialized society, so even if this were Alaska, Hawaii or Florida, the U.S. has undergone a process of racializing its groups. The specifics could vary, different states might have different laws or approaches, but schools are teaching about race, whether implicitly or explicitly. The lessons may differ, but they\\'re still about race.\\n\\nFor example, a school that offers ethnic studies and takes an anti-colonial, anti-imperialist stance is still teaching about race, even if the content and perspective differ. So, when I say this process happens everywhere, I\\'m talking about the underlying similarity, not the exact details.\\n\\n\"...in Arizona, teachers were basically forbidden. One of the teachers told me we were muzzled to talk to our students about the election. So there was a lot of fear, and that fear wasn\\'t addressed, so there was this stifling silence in the schools.\"\\n\\nI noticed that your educational background highlighted the importance of culturally relevant, race-conscious teaching. Why did your educational journey become so important to you that you wrote about it?\\n\\nMy background as an educator is shaped by political events in the U.S. For example, the banning of bilingual education in California and Arizona had a significant impact on me during my time as both a high school and undergraduate student. I had always planned to become a teacher, but at that point, I wasn\\'t sure whether I wanted to teach history or Spanish. When bilingual education was banned in Arizona, it really solidified my decision to become a Spanish teacher. I saw the ban as an attack on immigrants and the Latinx community, and that made it clear to me which path I wanted to pursue.\\n\\nI saw language as a very important issue for the community, which is why I chose to teach Spanish. Even from that point, it was something that mattered deeply to me. But being a teacher also had a major influence on how I think about the book. When I was teaching, my students talked about race all the time, through jokes and casual comments, it was something that came up constantly. However, as a teacher, I didn\\'t always know how to address it in a productive or helpful way. Sometimes, I felt like I was teaching concepts but not scaffolding my students\\' thinking effectively. I\\'d either move too slowly or too quickly, and I wasn\\'t prepared to teach about these complex issues. As many people know, these are very sensitive and taboo topics, and you can get into a lot of trouble if you don\\'t handle them correctly. It takes a lot of bravery as a teacher, and sometimes I made big mistakes. But these experiences were also formative for me and helped shape how I think about these issues.\\n\\nI want to focus on the recommendations you make in the conclusion of your book, particularly when you discuss embracing theory. I found it insightful when you mention that individual teachers don\\'t have all the answers. This really resonated with me because it highlights the vulnerability of educators and how that can be an asset.\\n\\nOne teacher I really admired shared that she knew she didn\\'t have all the answers, but she wanted to explore the issues with her students, and I truly admired that. It takes a lot of courage, and she was a very brave educator. Many of her lessons were meaningful to her students. I believe teachers can support each other by collaborating and sharing ideas for these kinds of lessons. I\\'m a strong advocate for taking an inquiry stance in teaching, which helps educators improve their own practices. I learned this approach from Professor Marilyn Cochran-Smith and her work with Susan Lytle. It involves teachers being systematic and intentional about examining their teaching in collaboration with others, looking at student work, discussing how to challenge students and exploring ways to expand their thinking.\\n\\nThe best teacher preparation, in my opinion, focuses on helping teachers feel supported and confident enough to take risks in the classroom. Vulnerability in teaching often means taking risks, so to foster this, teachers need ample support and proper training.\\n\\nYou can buy a copy of \"How Schools Make Race: Teaching Latinx Racialization in America\" here.'}\n",

By contrasting the prohibition of prayer in secular systems with the tolerance of this slur, the paper critiques the inadequacies of current structural frameworks in addressing systemic injustice. It further explores how language shapes societal norms and proposes a framework for rethinking linguistic accountability, with a focus on scientific and sociological research. The paper concludes by recommending legislative, cultural, and educational strategies to eradicate this term, emphasizing its potential to serve as a precedent for combating other forms of hate speech.\\n\\nLanguage is a powerful tool for constructing reality. Words have the ability to heal, inspire, harm, or dehumanize. Few words encapsulate this duality as starkly as the racial slur \"nigger.\" Originating in colonial times as a means of dehumanizing African-descended individuals, this word persists as a vestige of slavery and systemic racism. While the global community recognizes hate speech as a moral and legal offense, this particular term remains paradoxically present in cultural and societal contexts. This paper explores why its abolition is necessary, examining systemic contradictions such as the prohibition of prayer in secular institutions, which reflects inconsistent applications of societal norms.\\n\\nThe word \"nigger\" is not merely a slur; it is a linguistic artifact of oppression. Its use was instrumental in the transatlantic slave trade, serving to justify inhuman treatment and the commodification of Black individuals. Even post-slavery, its usage perpetuated psychological trauma and reinforced systemic segregation. This section will:\\n\\nDiscuss its transition into contemporary usage, including its appropriation in some cultural contexts.\\n\\n2.1 Psychological and Sociological Impacts\\n\\nNumerous studies document the detrimental effects of slurs on mental health, self-perception, and societal cohesion. This section will review research on how such language perpetuates stereotypes, normalizes violence, and undermines equality.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3. The Structural Contradictions of Language and Law\\n\\n3.1 Prohibition of Prayer vs. Tolerance of Slurs\\n\\nModern secular systems often prohibit religious expression, such as prayer, in public spaces to maintain neutrality. However, the tolerance or legal protection of hate speech like \"nigger\" reveals a profound inconsistency. This section will:\\n\\nAnalyze legal frameworks governing free speech and hate speech.\\n\\nContrast the treatment of spiritual expressions and harmful language.\\n\\nExamine the ethical implications of these inconsistencies.\\n\\n3.2 Systemic Inadequacies\\n\\nThe persistence of this slur highlights structural failures in addressing racism. These include:\\n\\nEducational deficits in teaching about historical racism.\\n\\n4.1 Linguistic Accountability and Societal Health\\n\\nLanguage shapes cultural norms and individual behaviors. Allowing derogatory terms like \"nigger\" to persist undermines societal progress. Abolition serves not only as a symbolic act but as a practical step toward dismantling systemic racism.\\n\\n4.2 International Precedents\\n\\nCountries like Germany have outlawed Nazi symbols and hate speech to prevent the perpetuation of oppressive ideologies. This section will analyze these precedents and their applicability to abolishing the word \"nigger.\"\\n\\n4.3 Practical Strategies for Abolition\\n\\nLegislation: Enacting laws to classify the word as hate speech subject to penalties.\\n\\nCultural Transformation: Promoting alternative narratives and redefining societal values through media and art.\\n\\nEducation: Developing curricula that address the history and harm of this word.\\n\\nPrayer, often prohibited in secular systems, represents spiritual and personal empowerment. Its suppression contrasts sharply with the permissibility of language that dehumanizes. This section examines:\\n\\nThe role of prayer in fostering social cohesion and personal resilience.\\n\\nThe systemic bias in prioritizing secular neutrality over human dignity.\\n\\nHow addressing such contradictions can strengthen structural justice.\\n\\nThis paper proposes a unified framework to address linguistic and structural inequities:\\n\\nRestorative Justice: Encouraging reparative dialogue and reconciliation.\\n\\nLegislative Reform: Balancing free speech with protections against harm.\\n\\nGlobal Solidarity: Collaborating across cultures to combat hate speech.\\n\\nThe abolition of the word \"nigger\" represents a critical step in addressing systemic racism and linguistic harm. By treating its usage as a form of societal profligation subject to severe penalties, we signal a commitment to justice and equity. Contrasting this with the prohibition of prayer reveals deep systemic contradictions, underscoring the need for comprehensive reform. A future free of such dehumanizing language is possible through legislative action, cultural transformation, and education.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe word \"nigger\" holds a unique and deeply traumatic position in the history of racial oppression, symbolizing systemic racism and violence. Despite occasional reappropriation within Black communities, its continued use outside these contexts perpetuates harm, discrimination, and psychological trauma. This paper contrasts the societal prohibition of \"prayer\" in certain public or governmental spaces with the tolerated use of racial slurs, highlighting structural inconsistencies. By drawing from historical, psychological, and legal perspectives, this study advocates for the abolition of such language through strict societal and legal frameworks.\\n\\nHistorical Context and Systemic Impacts\\n\\nThe n-word\\'s origin as a tool of dehumanization dates back to slavery and segregation, where it was a prelude to violence, including lynching and other atrocities. Its persistence symbolizes a system that normalizes anti-Blackness and undermines societal equity. Scholars have identified the word as \"the atomic bomb of racial slurs,\" reflecting its uniquely destructive psychological and societal impact. The term reinforces systemic racism by perpetuating stereotypes and fostering environments where discrimination thrives (sources: ADL, Psychology Today).\\n\\nLegal and Psychological Perspectives\\n\\nThe legal system inconsistently addresses hate speech and racial slurs. While hate crimes laws penalize acts motivated by bias, proving intent remains challenging. The n-word often functions as a trigger for violence, demonstrating its potent psychological effects. Studies show that exposure to racial slurs can cause enduring trauma, influencing behaviors and mental health over time (sources: OHCHR, OJP, Psychology Today).\\n\\nStructural Inadequacies: Prayer vs. Hate Speech\\n\\nContrasting the restriction of prayer in public institutions with the leniency towards racial slurs highlights systemic contradictions. Prayer is often prohibited in contexts aiming to uphold neutrality and prevent marginalization. However, the tolerance of racial epithets undermines this neutrality by tacitly endorsing harm against marginalized groups. This inconsistency reveals a structural failure to equitably protect individual dignity and safety.\\n\\nRecommendations\\n\\n1. Abolition Through Legislation: Strengthen hate speech laws to explicitly include the prohibition of racial slurs, with penalties reflecting their societal harm.\\n\\n2. Education and Awareness: Implement educational initiatives to address the history and impact of such language, emphasizing its role in systemic oppression.\\n\\n3. Community Empowerment: Support the reappropriation of language within marginalized communities while discouraging its use by others to prevent perpetuation of harm.\\n\\n4. Structural Reforms: Address systemic biases in policy-making that tolerate harmful language while restricting other forms of expression.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe systemic tolerance of racial slurs like the n-word is a manifestation of structural racism that undermines societal progress. Abolishing such language requires a comprehensive approach involving legal, educational, and social reforms. Addressing this issue not only honors the dignity of those affected but also strengthens the moral and ethical fabric of society.\\n\\nIn the sprawling labyrinth of systemic governance, where laws claim to safeguard dignity and equality, a glaring hypocrisy festers. On one hand, institutions silence prayer -- a quiet invocation of hope, unity, and introspection -- under the guise of secular neutrality. On the other, these same systems shield hate speech, particularly the visceral linguistic weaponry of the word \"nigger,\" cloaking its use in the sanctity of \"free expression.\" This contradiction is not a mere oversight but a seismic failure of moral and structural integrity. The persistence of this slur serves as an indictment of the inadequacies of modern systems, exposing their complicity in perpetuating oppression while masquerading as bastions of liberty.\\n\\n1. Prayer: Silenced Benevolence\\n\\nPrayer, an act of spiritual alignment and communal solace, is systematically expunged from public spaces to uphold secularism. This prohibition is framed as essential to protecting inclusivity, yet it suppresses a harmless, often uplifting practice. The rationale behind this exclusion betrays a fear of offense, yet paradoxically, it allows offensive language -- rooted in hate -- to flourish unchecked.\\n\\n2. The N-Word: Protected Oppression\\n\\nThe n-word, a verbal relic of slavery\\'s barbarity, survives as a cultural anomaly: a word so potent in its dehumanization that it continues to wound across generations. Protected by laws intended to defend expression, it has become a totem of systemic hypocrisy. By tolerating its usage, societies tacitly endorse its underlying ideology -- one that denies humanity and perpetuates racial hierarchies.\\n\\nSanctifying Harm, Criminalizing Hope\\n\\nThe double standard between prayer and slurs unmasks a systemic prioritization of abstract ideals over tangible harm. Prayer, which often fosters connection and resilience, is suppressed as potentially divisive, while slurs, which undeniably fracture the social fabric, are tolerated. This prioritization reveals a skewed moral compass, where the avoidance of ideological discomfort supersedes the protection of human dignity.\\n\\nLegal Contradictions as a Disgrace\\n\\nSecular laws punish expressions of spirituality to preserve neutrality, yet they fail to curtail language explicitly designed to oppress. This contradiction underscores the inadequacy of frameworks that claim to champion equality while upholding structural inequities.\\n\\n1. Legislative Abolition of Hate Speech\\n\\nSocieties must confront their linguistic relics with unflinching clarity. Laws should eradicate racial slurs from public lexicons, treating them as instruments of psychological violence. This abolition would signal a decisive rejection of systemic racism.\\n\\n2. Cultural Renaissance\\n\\nA cultural movement is needed to reclaim linguistic spaces from the shadows of oppression. Through art, education, and public discourse, society must dismantle the normalized violence of slurs while redefining speech as a tool for justice, not harm.\\n\\n3. Reframing Freedom\\n\\nTrue freedom lies not in the unchecked license to harm but in the empowerment of individuals to coexist with dignity. Reframing freedom as responsibility would enable societies to prioritize collective well-being over the preservation of outdated and oppressive norms.\\n\\nThe systemic tolerance of the n-word, juxtaposed with the prohibition of prayer, symbolizes a deep moral chasm. This inconsistency is not just a structural flaw but a betrayal of justice itself. To reclaim societal integrity, we must uproot these double standards and construct frameworks that honor the intrinsic worth of every individual. The abolition of hateful language is not an attack on freedom but its ultimate affirmation -- a visionary step toward a future where words heal rather than harm.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Hefner First Amendment Award in Book Publishing in 2013, and \"Not in Front of the Children: Indecency, Censorship, and the Innocence of Youth,\" which won the American Library Association\\'s Eli Oboler Award for Best Published Work in the Field of Intellectual Freedom in 2002.\\n\\nHer most recent book is \"Ironies and Complications of Free Speech: News and Commentary From the Free Expression Policy Project.\" She has written three other books and scores of popular and scholarly articles on free speech, censorship, constitutional law, copyright, and the arts. She has taught at New York University, the University of California - San Diego, Boston College Law School, and the American University of Paris. Since 2015, she has been a volunteer tour guide at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\\n\\nGreene: Can you introduce yourself and the work you\\'ve done on free speech and how you got there?\\n\\nHeins: I\\'m Marjorie Heins, I\\'m a retired lawyer. I spent most of my career at the ACLU. I started in Boston, where we had a very small office, and we sort of did everything -- some sex discrimination cases, a lot of police misconduct cases, occasionally First Amendment. Then, after doing some teaching and a stint at the Massachusetts Attorney General\\'s office, I found myself in the national office of the ACLU in New York, starting a project on art censorship. This was in response to the political brouhaha over the National Endowment for the Arts starting around 1989/ 1990.\\n\\nCulture wars, attacks on some of the grants made by the NEA, became a big hot button issue. The ACLU was able to raise a little foundation money to hire a lawyer to work on some of these cases. And one case that was already filed when I got there was National Endowment for the Arts vs Finley. It was basically a challenge by four theater performance artists whose grants had been recommended by the peer panel but then ultimately vetoed by the director after a lot of political pressure because their work was very much \"on the edge.\" So I joined the legal team in that case, the Finley case, and it had a long and complicated history. Then, by the mid-1990s we were faced with the internet. And there were all these scares over pornography on the internet poisoning the minds of our children. So the ACLU got very involved in challenging censorship legislation that had been passed by Congress, and I worked on those cases.\\n\\nI left the ACLU in 1998 to write a book about what I had learned about censorship. I was curious to find out more about the history primarily of obscenity legislation -- the censorship of sexual communications. So it\\'s a scholarly book called \"Not in front of the Children.\" Among the things I discovered is that the origins of censorship of sexual content, sexual communications, come out of this notion that we need to protect children and other \"vulnerable beings.\" And initially that included women and uneducated people, but eventually it really boiled down to children -- we need censorship basically of everybody in order to protect children. So that\\'s what Not in front of the Children was all about.\\n\\nAnd then I took my foundation contacts -- because at the ACLU if you have a project you have to raise money -- and started a little project, a little think tank which became affiliated with the National Coalition Against Censorship called the Free Expression Policy Project. And at that point we weren\\'t really doing litigation anymore, we were doing a lot of friend of the court briefs, a lot of policy reports and advocacy articles about some of the values and competing interests in the whole area of free expression. And one premise of this project, from the start, was that we are not absolutists. So we didn\\'t accept the notion that because the First Amendment says \"Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech,\" then there\\'s some kind of absolute protection for something called free speech and there can\\'t be any exceptions. And, of course, there are many exceptions.\\n\\nSo the basic premise of the Free Expression Policy Project was that some exceptions to the First Amendment, like obscenity laws, are not really justified because they are driven by different ideas about morality and a notion of moral or emotional harm rather than some tangible harm that you can identify like, for example, in the area of libel and slander or invasion of privacy or harassment. Yes, there are exceptions. The default, the presumption, is free speech, but there could be many reasons why free speech is curtailed in certain circumstances.\\n\\nThe Free Expression Policy Project continued for about seven years. It moved to the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law School for a while, and, finally, I ran out of ideas and funding. I kept up the website for a little while longer, then ultimately ended the website. Then I thought, \"okay, there\\'s a lot of good information on this website and it\\'s all going to disappear, so I\\'m going to put it into a book.\" Oh, I left out the other book I worked on in the early 2000s - about academic freedom, the history of academic freedom, called \"Priests of Our Democracy: The Supreme Court, Academic Freedom, and the Anti-Communist Purge.\" This book goes back in history even before the 1940s and 1950s Red Scare and the effect that it had on teachers and universities. And then this last book is called \"Ironies and Complications of Free Speech: News and Commentary From the Free Expression Policy Project,\" which is basically an anthology of the best writings from the Free Expression Policy Project.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s me. That\\'s what I did.\\n\\nGreene: So we have a ton to talk about because a lot of the things you\\'ve written about are either back in the news and regulatory cycle or never left it. So I want to start with your book \"Not in Front of the Children\" first. I have at least one copy and I\\'ve been referring to it a lot and suggesting it because we\\'ve just seen a ton of efforts to try and pass new child protection laws to protect kids from online harms. And so I\\'m curious, first there was a raft of efforts around Tik Tok being bad for kids, now we\\'re seeing a lot of efforts aimed at shielding kids from harmful material online. Do you think this a throughline from concerns back from mid-19th Century England. Is it still the same debate or is there something different about these online harms?\\n\\nBoth are true I think. It\\'s the same and it\\'s different. What\\'s the same is that using the children as an argument for basically trying to suppress information, ideas, or expression that somebody disapproves of goes back to the beginning of censorship laws around sexuality. And the subject matters have changed, the targets have changed. I\\'m not too aware of new proposals for internet censorship of kids, but I\\'m certainly aware of what states -- of course, Florida being the most prominent example -- have done in terms of school books, school library books, public library books, and education from not only k-12 but also higher education in terms of limiting the subject matters that can be discussed. And the primary target seems to be anything to do with gay or lesbian sexuality and anything having to do with a frank acknowledgement of American slavery or Jim Crow racism. Because the argument in Florida, and this is explicit in the law, is because it would make white kids feel bad, so let\\'s not talk about it. So in that sense the two targets that I see now -- we\\'ve got to protect the kids against information about gay and lesbian people and information about the true racial history of this country -- are a little different from the 19th century and even much of the 20th century.\\n\\nGreene: One of the things I see is that the harms motivating the book bans and school restrictions are the same harms that are motivating at least some of the legislators who are trying to pass these laws. And notably a lot of the laws only address online harmful material without being specific about subject matter. We\\'re still seeing some that are specifically about sexual material, but a lot of them, including the Kids Online Safety Act really just focus on online harms more broadly.\\n\\nI haven\\'t followed that one, but it sounds like it might have a vagueness problem!\\n\\nGreene: One of the things I get concerned about with the focus on design is that, like, a state Attorney General is not going to be upset if the design has kids reading a lot of bible verses or tomes about being respectful to your parents. But they will get upset and prosecute people if the design feature is recommending to kids gender-affirming care or whatever. I just don\\'t know if there\\'s a way of protecting against that in a law.\\n\\nWell, as we all know, when we\\'re dealing with commercial speech there\\'s a lot more leeway in terms of regulation, and especially if ads are directed at kids. So I don\\'t have a problem with government legislation in the area of restricting the kinds of advertising that can be directed at kids. But if you get out of the area of commercial speech and to something that\\'s kind of medical, could you have constitutional legislation that prohibited websites from directing kids to medically dangerous procedures? You\\'re sort of getting close to the borderline. If it\\'s just information then I think the legislation is probably going to be unconstitutional even if it\\'s related to kids.\\n\\nGreene: Let\\'s shift to academic freedom. Which is another fraught issue. What do you think of the current debates now over both restrictions on faculty and universities restricting student speech?\\n\\nAcademic freedom is under the gun from both sides of the political spectrum. For example, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, although they seem well-intentioned, have led to some pretty troubling outcomes. So that when those college presidents were being interrogated by the members of Congress (in December 2023), they were in a difficult position, among other reasons, because at least at Harvard and Penn it was pretty clear there were instances of really appalling applications of this idea of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion - both to require a certain kind of ideological approach and to censor or punish people who didn\\'t go along with the party line, so to speak.\\n\\nThe other example I\\'m thinking of, and I don\\'t know if Harvard and Penn do this - I know that the University of California system does it or at least it used to - everybody who applies for a faculty position has to sign a diversity statement, like a loyalty oath, saying that these are the principles they agree with and they will promise to promote.\\n\\nAnd you know you have examples, I mean I may sound very retrograde on this one, but I will not use the pronoun \"they\" for a singular person. And I know that would mean I couldn\\'t get a faculty job! And I\\'m not sure if my volunteer gig at the Met museum is going to be in trouble because they, very much like universities, have given us instructions, pages and pages of instructions, on proper terminology - what terminology is favored or disfavored or should never be used, and \"they\" is in there. You can have circumlocutions so you can identify a single individual without using he or she if that individual - I mean you can\\'t even know what the individual\\'s preference is. So that\\'s another example of academic freedom threats from I guess you could call the left or the DEI establishment.\\n\\nThe right in American politics has a lot of material, a lot of ammunition to use when they criticize universities for being too politically correct and too \"woke.\" On the other hand, you have the anti-woke law in Florida which is really, as I said before, directed against education about the horrible racial history of this country. And some of those laws are just - whatever you may think about the ability of state government and state education departments to dictate curriculum and to dictate what viewpoints are going to be promoted in the curriculum - the Florida anti-woke law and don\\'t say gay law really go beyond I think any kind of discretion that the courts have said state and local governments have to determine curriculum.\\n\\nGreene: Are you surprised at all that we\\'re seeing that book bans are as big of a thing now as they were twenty years ago?\\n\\nWell, nothing surprises me. But yes, I would not have predicted that there were going to be the current incarnations of what you can remember from the old days, groups like the American Family Association, the Christian Coalition, the Eagle Forum, the groups that were \"culture warriors\" who were making a lot of headlines with their arguments forty years ago against even just having art that was done by gay people. We\\'ve come a long way from that, but now we have Moms for Liberty and present-day incarnations of the same groups. The homophobia agenda is a little more nuanced, it\\'s a little different from what we were seeing in the days of Jesse Helms in Congress. But the attacks on drag performances, this whole argument that children are going to be groomed to become drag queens or become gay -- that\\'s a little bit of a different twist, but it\\'s basically the same kind of homophobia. So it\\'s not surprising that it\\'s being churned up again if this is something that politicians think they can get behind in order to get elected. Or, let me put it another way, if the Moms for Liberty type groups make enough noise and seem to have enough political potency, then politicians are going to cater to them.\\n\\nAnd so the answer has to be groups on the other side that are making the free expression argument or the intellectual freedom argument or the argument that teachers and professors and librarians are the ones who should decide what books are appropriate. Those groups have to be as vocal and as powerful in order to persuade politicians that they don\\'t have to start passing censorship legislation in order to get votes.\\n\\nGreene: Going back to the college presidents and being grilled on the hill, you wrote that maybe there was, in response to the genocide question, which I think they were most sharply criticized there, that there was a better answer that they could have given. Could you talk about that?\\n\\nI think in that context, both for political reasons and for reasons of policy and free speech doctrine, the answer had to be that if students on campus are calling for genocide of Jews or any other ethnic or religious group that should not be permitted on campus and that amounts to racial harassment. Of course, I suppose you could imagine scenarios where two antisemitic kids in the privacy of their dorm room said this and nobody else heard it -- okay, maybe it doesn\\'t amount to racial harassment. But private colleges are not bound by the First Amendment. They all have codes of civility. Public colleges are bound by the First Amendment, but not the same standards as the public square. So I took the position that in that circumstance the presidents had to answer, \"Yes, that would violate our policies and subject a student to discipline.\" But that\\'s not the same as calling for the intifada or calling for even the elimination of the state of Israel as having been a mistake 75 years ago. So I got a little pushback on that little blog post that I wrote. And somebody said, \"I\\'m surprised a former ACLU lawyer is saying that calling for genocide could be punished on a college campus.\" But you know, the ACLU has many different political opinions within both the staff and Board. There were often debates on different kinds of free speech issues and where certain lines are drawn. And certainly on issues of harassment and when hate speech becomes harassment -- under what circumstances it becomes harassment. So, yes, I think that\\'s what they should have said. A lot of legal scholars, including David Cole of the ACLU, said they gave exactly the right answer, the legalistic answer, that it depends on the context. In that political situation that was not the right answer.\\n\\nGreene: It was awkward. They did answer as if they were having an academic discussion and not as if they were talking to members of Congress.\\n\\nWell they also answered as if they were programmed. I mean Claudine Gay repeated the exact same words that probably somebody had told her to say at least twice if not more. And that did not look very good. It didn\\'t look like she was even thinking for herself.\\n\\nGreene: I do think they were anticipating the followup question of, \"Well isn\\'t saying \\'From the River to the Sea\\' a call for genocide and how come you haven\\'t punished students for that?\" But as you said, that would then lead into a discussion of how we determine what is or is not a call for genocide.\\n\\nWell they didn\\'t need a followup question because to Elise Stefanik, \"Intifada\" or \"from the river to the sea\" was equivalent to a call for genocide, period, end of discussion. Let me say one more thing about these college hearings. What these presidents needed to say is that it\\'s very scary when politicians start interrogating college faculty or college presidents about curriculum, governance, and certainly faculty hires. One of the things that was going on there was they didn\\'t think there were enough conservatives on college faculties, and that was their definition of diversity. You have to push back on that, and say it is a real threat to academic freedom and all of the values that we talk about that are important at a university education when politicians start getting their hands on this and using funding as a threat and so forth. They needed to say that.\\n\\nGreene: Let\\'s pull back and talk about free speech principles more broadly. Why is, after many years of work in this area, why do you think free expression is important?\\n\\nWhat is the value of free expression more globally? [laughs] A lot of people have opined on that.\\n\\nGreene: Why is it important to you personally?\\n\\nWell I define it pretty broadly. So it doesn\\'t just include political debate and discussion and having all points of view represented in the public square, which used to be the narrower definition of what the First Amendment meant, certainly according to the Supreme Court. But the Court evolved. And so it\\'s now recognized, as it should be, that free expression includes art. The movies -- it doesn\\'t even have to be verbal -- it can be dance, it can be abstract painting. All of the arts, which feed the soul, are part of free expression. And that\\'s very important to me because I think it enriches us. It enriches our intellects, it enriches our spiritual lives, our emotional lives. And I think it goes without saying that political expression is crucial to having a democracy, however flawed it may be.\\n\\nGreene: You mentioned earlier that you don\\'t consider yourself to be a free speech absolutist. Do you consider yourself to be a maximalist or an enthusiast? What do you see as being sort of legitimate restrictions on any individual\\'s freedom of expression?\\n\\nWell, we mentioned this at the beginning. There are a lot of exceptions to the First Amendment that are legitimate and certainly, when I started at the ACLU I thought that defamation laws and libel and slander laws violate the first amendment. Well, I\\'ve changed my opinion. Because there\\'s real harm that gets caused by libel and slander. As we know, the Supreme Court has put some First Amendment restrictions around those torts, but they\\'re important to have. Threats are a well-recognized exception to the freedom of speech, and the kind of harm caused by threats, even if they\\'re not followed through on, is pretty obvious. Incitement becomes a little trickier because where do you draw the lines? But at some point an incitement to violent action I think can be restricted for obvious reasons of public safety. And then we have restrictions on false advertising but, of course, if we\\'re not in the commercial context, the Supreme Court has told us that lies are protected by the First Amendment. That\\'s probably wise just in terms of not trying to get the government and the judicial process involved in deciding what is a lie and what isn\\'t. But of course that\\'s done all the time in the context of defamation and commercial speech. Hate speech is something, as we know, that\\'s prohibited in many parts of Europe but not here. At least not in the public square as opposed to employment contexts or educational contexts. Some people would say, \"Well, that\\'s dictated by the First Amendment and they don\\'t have the First Amendment over there in Europe, so we\\'re better.\" But having worked in this area for a long time and having read many Supreme Court decisions, it seems to me the First Amendment has been subjected to the same kind of balancing test that they use in Europe when they interpret their European Convention on Human Rights or their individual constitutions. They just have different policy choices. And the policy choice to prohibit hate speech given the history of Europe is understandable. Whether it is effective in terms of reducing racism, Islamophobia, antisemitism... is there more of that in Europe than there is here? Hard to know. It\\'s probably not that effective. You make martyrs out of people who are prosecuted for hate speech. But on the other hand, some of it is very troubling. In the United States Holocaust denial is protected.\\n\\nGreene: Can you talk a little bit about your experience being a woman advocating for first amendment rights for sexual expression during a time when there was at least some form of feminist movement saying that some types of sexualization of women was harmful to women?\\n\\nThat drove a wedge right through the feminist movement for quite a number of years. There\\'s still some of that around, but I think less. The battle against pornography has been pretty much a losing battle.\\n\\nGreene: Are there lessons from that time? You were clearly on one side of it, are there lessons to be learned from that when we talk about sort of speech harms?\\n\\nOne of the policy reports we did at the Free Expression Policy Project was on media literacy as an alternative to censorship. Media literacy can be expanded to encompass a lot of different kinds of education. So if you had decent sex education in this country and kids were able to think about the kinds of messages that you see in commercial pornography and amateur pornography, in R-rated movies, in advertising -- I mean the kind of sexist messages and demeaning messages that you see throughout the culture -- education is the best way of trying to combat some of that stuff.\\n\\nGreene: Okay, our final question that we ask everyone. Who is your free speech hero?\\n\\nWhen I started working on \"Priests of our Democracy\" the most important case, sort of the culmination of the litigation that took place challenging loyalty programs and loyalty oaths, was a case called Keyishian v. Board of Regents. This is a case in which Justice Brennan, writing for a very slim majority of five Justices, said academic freedom is \"a special concern of the First Amendment, which does not tolerate laws that cast a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom.\" Harry Keyishian was one of the five plaintiffs in this case. He was one of five faculty members at the University of Buffalo who refused to sign what was called the Feinberg Certificate, which was essentially a loyalty oath. The certificate required all faculty to say \"I\\'ve never been a member of the Communist Party and if I was, I told the President and the Dean all about it.\" He was not a member of the Communist Party, but as Harry said much later in an interview - because he had gone to college in the 1950s and he saw some of the best professors being summarily fired for refusing to cooperate with some of these Congressional investigating committees - fast forward to the Feinberg Certificate loyalty oath: he said his refusal to sign was his \"revenge on the 1950s.\" And so he becomes the plaintiff in this case that challenges the whole Feinberg Law, this whole elaborate New York State law that basically required loyalty investigations of every teacher in the public system. So Harry became my hero. I start my book with Harry. The first line in my book is, \"Harry Keyishian was a junior at Queen\\'s College in the Fall of 1952 when the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee came to town.\" And he\\'s still around. I think he just had his 90th birthday!'}\n",

      "filtered article =  {'topic': 'Race Bilingual', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech and racial issues in bilingual communities', 'title': \"Manchester's Train Deportation of Gypsy Children Sparks Protest in London\", 'url': 'https://www.vice.com/en/article/gypsy-roma-traveller-protest-london/', 'published_date': '2024-12-04T12:51:12Z', 'source': 'VICE', 'content': 'Last month in Manchester saw the latest incident highlighting the discrimination that Gypsies, Roma, and Travellers (GRT) have faced for centuries in the UK.\\n\\nWhile traveling to a Christmas market on November 30th, Greater Manchester Police forced children from these communities -- some aged as young as ten -- onto trains carrying them far from the city center. Some claim they ended up 100 miles away in Grimsby. According to reports in The Travellers\\' Times and national press, children were assaulted in the process.\\n\\nThe police have been criticized for \"racial profiling,\" violating children\\'s physical safety, and undermining their dignity and human rights. Despite public outcry after videos of the train deportation and other flare-ups between police and the GRT communities surfaced on social media, no justification has been provided, and the officers involved remain in their posts.\\n\\nBy many metrics the most marginalized communities in the UK, the incident has been framed by GRT people as part of a broader, ingrained targeting of them by authorities, society, and the media -- some of whom took the extra step of organizing a protest in London this past weekend.\\n\\n\"Seeing the police brutality -- the boy held down, with pressure on his neck -- was horrifying,\" said Laura Collins, a GRT activist who organized the demonstration in Parliament Square last Saturday, November 30. \"For any mother, regardless of being a Traveller, you should be outraged.\" Her words resonated with the small but impassioned crowd in front of Westminster.\\n\\nStephanie McDonagh, a prominent advocate for GRT rights, stated, \"What happened in Manchester is not just a one-off. It\\'s part of a long history of mistreatment and prejudice against our people.\"\\n\\nResearch by The Traveller Movement reveals that Gypsies, Roma, and Travellers are more likely to face racial assaults than any other ethnic group in the UK. In 2023 alone, 62 percent of Gypsies and Travellers, and 47 percent of Roma people, reported experiencing a racial assault. Yet, less than 15 percent of these hate crimes are ever reported, reflecting a deep mistrust of law enforcement.\\n\\nThis mistrust is not unwarranted. \"There have been other cases where members of our community were brutally treated by those in authority, even losing their lives, and yet the CPS won\\'t act,\" Collins said. In the case of the Manchester incident, the failure to suspend or investigate the officers involved only reinforces perceptions of impunity.\\n\\nMary K. Foy -- the chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Gypsies, Travellers, and Roma -- has written to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper MP, calling for a full investigation. Yet, as of now, the police officers involved have not been held to account.\\n\\nIn fact, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham defended GMP\\'s actions during a BBC Radio Manchester phone-in, citing intelligence on potential anti-social behavior. \"Everyone has got a place in our city-region as long as people are coming to abide by the law,\" he said, denying accusations of racism. However, community members argue his justification ignores the discriminatory targeting of a specific group based on stereotypes rather than evidence.\\n\\nHistorically, GRT people have been pushed to the fringes of society, denied basic rights, and subjected to violent persecution. They have often been framed as a \"problem\" in media that must be \"managed,\" further entrenching prejudices.\\n\\nOne protester, \\'JR,\\' founder of the Gypsy Traveller League, reflected on this issue: \"[The TV show] Big Fat Gypsy Weddings destroyed us. It was a big downfall. These types of programs are not helping -- they\\'re just looking for money.\" Such portrayals distort public perception, reinforcing prejudice and fueling discrimination.\\n\\nJR\\'s own children shared his experiences. His young daughter said, \"It makes me feel sad because it\\'s not really nice for us... not serving people who\\'s having family-time stuff because they hear our voices and what we sound like.\"\\n\\nDespite these challenges, grassroots movements are fighting back. The #StopTravellerHate campaign, launched by The Traveller Movement, is calling for an end to the online hate speech that disproportionately targets GRT communities. Online hate speech against GRT people accounts for 15 percent of all racist or discriminatory slurs in the UK, and this figure is growing. Activists are working tirelessly to challenge these hate-filled narratives and demand greater protections for GRT individuals both online and offline.\\n\\nAdvocates are pushing for stronger hate crime reporting mechanisms, as GRT people often avoid the police out of distrust. Bias is pervasive; an ex-pub chain employee at the protest revealed, \"They\\'ve got a code word for us. They call us \\'Jelly Babies.\\'\" As JR put it, \"We\\'re constantly fighting against these stereotypes that have been put on us, and it\\'s exhausting. But we keep fighting, because that\\'s all we can do.\"\\n\\nFor many, the Manchester incident was a painful reminder of the past. \"Seven security attacked Michael McDonagh because he was an Irish Traveller,\" recalled Stephanie McDonagh, speaking powerfully about her father\\'s own experiences with police brutality. \"He was targeted. They held him to the ground and put a restraint on his neck. Over 150 witnesses came forward. Many said they heard Dad call out that he couldn\\'t breathe, but they didn\\'t lift the restraint from his neck.\" Despite the overwhelming evidence, no one has been charged or prosecuted for his death at Parkdean holiday resort in Camber Sands in 2022.\\n\\nMcDonagh claims that when she and her siblings tried to hand out leaflets asking for witnesses to come forward, staff at the resort tried to prevent them from doing so. (A spokesman for the resort said they \"do not recognize\" these allegations.) This suppression of evidence and refusal to hold those responsible to account underscores the systemic nature of anti-Traveller oppression in the UK. \"If this happened to anyone else, it would be all over the media. But when it\\'s Travellers, it\\'s ignored,\" she added.\\n\\nThese personal accounts highlight the deep emotional and psychological toll that racial discrimination takes on individuals within the GRT community. The trauma of being constantly targeted, dehumanized, and denied basic rights is an inescapable part of their lived reality.\\n\\nAs protest organizers and community leaders have argued, it isn\\'t enough to acknowledge the discrimination facing the GRT community. \"There\\'s an embedded institutional prejudice that\\'s not being addressed at the root,\" Collins said. \"We need people from our community in leadership roles -- not as tokens but as actual contributors -- to teach, reform, and add to the policies that impact us.\" Another protester summed up the urgency: \"We need society to listen to our people, to imprint our voices in policies and laws. We need to be trained and supported to access leadership roles, to be in the rooms where decisions are made.\"\\n\\nFor the GRT community, the fight is ongoing, the struggle far from over. \"We need more people to stand with us, to speak out, and not just when it\\'s convenient. This fight is for everyone, not just for us. We\\'re all in this together,\" one protester urged.\\n\\nIn the words of grandmother and protester, Noreen Ward, \"We are all human. We come into this world the same way, and we leave it the same way. We all need to respect one another.\"\\n\\nThe events in Manchester, and the painful stories shared by members of the GRT community, highlight the urgent need for real change to come. Until it does, the voices of the GRT community will continue to demand justice, respect, and equality.'}\n",

The force dropped the case on Thursday.\\n\\nWhile Pearson was being investigated for an alleged crime, she initially thought an NCHI was being recorded against her. The case prompted criticism of NCHIs, which do not meet the criminal threshold but are recorded by police regardless.\\n\\nSpeaking on Radio 4\\'s PM, Pearson said: \"The issue here is these non-crime hate incidents are out of control. Nobody with great knowledge of the law has ever suggested that there was any basis for charging me with anything.\\n\\n\"And we have to ask the question, why did Essex police persist in this? Why did they escalate it with me? I did not incite racial hate, nobody thinks I incited racial hate.\\n\\n\"I feel I was bullied and threatened, and this was wholly disproportionate. I won\\'t censor myself, but I will be more watchful in future.\"\\n\\nThe plans to expand the recording of NCHI were first revealed in the summer but have recently come under fresh scrutiny.\\n\\nFree speech campaigners are also threatening to take legal action against the Home Office if it goes ahead with plans to unpick rules laid down by the former home secretary Suella Braverman to stop police recording incidents just because someone was offended.\\n\\nThe rules, introduced last year, limited officers to recording personal data for NCHIs only where there was a \"real risk of significant harm\" to individuals or groups and a real risk that a future criminal offence could be committed against them.\\n\\nHowever, a report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in September found many forces were still failing to correctly apply the guidance.\\n\\nIt uncovered evidence that confusion over the rules meant officers were taking a risk-averse approach summed up as \"if in doubt, record\". As a result, NCHIs were too often being logged for complaints that amounted to little more than people\\'s \"hurt feelings\".\\n\\nPolice have recorded a non-crime hate incident after a person refused to shake hands, which the victim \"perceived to be hate related due to gender identity\".\\n\\nThey also logged a \"rough\" haircut reported by a customer who claimed his barber was \"aggressive\" following a discussion about the Ukraine war.\\n\\nMs Cooper has urged police to use \"common sense\" when recording non-crime hate incidents and has pointed to recommendations by the HM inspectorate for improved training and clearer direction for officers.\\n\\nA Home Office source said: \"We support the Inspectorate and College of Policing assessment that there needs to be a common sense and consistent approach - that means that trivial, irrational or malicious cases should not be recorded.\\n\\n\"The Inspectorate has been clear that guidance is not being followed consistently and we\\'ll be working with them and the College of Policing to make sure that the recommendations are implemented.\\n\\n\"Over the past 12 months there has been a big increase in anti-Semitism and Islamophobia and it\\'s really important that police forces are able to track and monitor that so that action can be taken to prevent harassment, crime or serious threats.\"\\n\\nLabour believes it can amend the guidelines to boost the recording of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia without changing the wider requirements to follow a common sense approach and not to record trivial or irrational incidents.\\n\\n\"Squaring the circle is what we are looking at mechanisms to do,\" said a Home Office source, although they added that it was not being actively pursued at the moment.\\n\\nA No 10 spokesman said Sir Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister, was clear that the police should be spending their time protecting the public and keeping streets safe.\\n\\n\"When it comes to those incidents we\\'ve also said that it\\'s vital we carefully consider how we balance the fundamental right to free speech and how police can gather information where relevant. We\\'re looking at how we can best ensure this is the case and will set out next steps in due course,\" said the spokesman.\\n\\nThe Free Speech Union (FSU) and former police officer Harry Miller, chief executive of campaign group Fair Cop, have written to Ms Cooper threatening legal action if there is any loosening of the guidance on NCHIs.\\n\\nThe guidance was re-written by the Home Office and College of Policing under Mrs Braverman after Mr Miller won a Court of Appeal challenge over a police investigation into his tweets. The judges ruled the old NCHI guidance had been wrongly used and had a \"chilling effect\" on his freedom of speech.\\n\\nToby Young, director of the FSU, said: \"The reason Suella Braverman tried to circumscribe the recording and retention of NCHIs isn\\'t because, as a Tory, she has more tolerance for anti-Semitic and Islamophobic hatred than the lovely and caring Yvette Cooper.\\n\\n\"It\\'s because the Court of Appeal in Miller vs College of Policing ruled that the guidance devised by the College, and the behaviour of the police in their efforts to comply with it, was unlawful.\\n\\n\"If Yvette Cooper scraps the statutory guidance and encourages the police to record even more NCHIs, she will be ordering them to go back to breaking the law. That\\'s not a great look for the Home Secretary.'}\n",
      "filtered article =  {'topic': 'Race Bilingual', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech and racial issues in bilingual communities', 'title': \"The bleak future for India's minorities\", 'url': 'https://muslimmirror.com/the-bleak-future-for-indias-minorities/', 'published_date': '2024-12-03T11:55:12Z', 'source': 'Muslim Mirror', 'content': 'India has over 700 ethnic groups and six primary religions, and the country\\'s Constitution affirms that India is a secular country, not a Hindu, Christian, or Muslim one. Despite this diversity, the Hindu majority has made life for everyone else very uncomfortable. Minorities such as Dalits, Muslims, and Christians face discrimination in employment, education, and access to essential services. This has led to a lack of economic and social opportunities for these communities, contributing to poverty and marginalization.\\n\\nAnother significant issue is the rise of communal violence and religious hatred. In recent years, there has been a surge in violence and religious clashes, mainly targeting minorities. This has led to widespread fear and insecurity among these communities and has caused significant harm to their homes, businesses, and places of worship.\\n\\nMuslims make up roughly 13 per cent of India\\'s population of 1.1 billion, and their numbers are nearly equal to the entire population of Pakistan, which was carved out of British India almost 60 years ago as the homeland of the subcontinent\\'s Muslims. Soul-searching about Muslim rights and well-being in India, which has witnessed periodic outbreaks of religious violence, has been a leitmotif ever since.\\n\\nTensions between Hindus and Muslims in India are not new, but they have gotten worse under Modi, whose ruling Bharatiya Janata Party touts a Hindu-nationalist ideology. And with Modi seemingly on the cusp of a third five-year term, the outlook for Muslim politicians - and citizens - is bleak.\\n\\nIt\\'s not just that Modi has ramped up anti-Muslim rhetoric in campaign speeches. Ever since the BJP began its rise as a political force in the mid-1980s, the proportion of Muslim lawmakers in parliament and state legislatures has shrunk.\\n\\nMuslim representation has fallen in the ruling BJP and in opposition parties, too. When Modi assumed power in 2014, the outgoing parliament had 30 Muslim lawmakers - and just one was a member of the BJP. Muslims now hold 25 out of 543 seats, and none belong to the BJP.\\n\\nIndia has gone from being a country where it marginalized Muslims but who are now slowly they are being \"actively excluded,\"\\n\\n\"Without representation, you are unable to ask the state for resources and articulate the kind of needs the community has in order to progress, whether its education, jobs, health or basic infrastructure,\" Mahmudabad said.\\n\\nIn the mid-1980s, Muslims accounted for 11% of India\\'s population and had 9% of seats in parliament; today, they are 14% of the population and have less than 5% of seats in parliament.\\n\\nNine out of 10 members of parliament are Hindus, who make up 80 per cent of India\\'s population of 1.4 billion. The political representation of Muslims at the state level is only slightly better. India has more than 4,000 lawmakers in state legislatures across 28 states, and Muslim lawmakers hold roughly 6% of these seats.\\n\\nA government report in 2006 found Muslims lagged Hindus, Christians and people from India\\'s lower castes in literacy, income and access to education. They have made some gains since then but are still at a significant disadvantage, according to multiple independent studies.\\n\\nUnder Modi\\'s decade in power, the BJP has enacted or proposed various laws that Muslim leaders consider discriminatory.\\n\\n- Some states ruled by the BJP passed laws restricting interfaith marriage as a way to address what they claim is the threat posed by Hindu women marrying Muslim men and then converting.\\n\\n- One state formerly ruled by the BJP banned girls from wearing hijabs in school. (The law was reversed after the BJP lost political control.)\\n\\n- The BJP is advocating a standard legal code that would affect some religious practices by changing some laws in India\\'s Constitution that deal with matters ranging from marriage to divorce and inheritance.\\n\\nViolence against Muslims is commonplace, and Modi has said little to deter it. Muslims have been lynched by Hindu mobs over allegations of eating beef or smuggling cows, an animal considered holy to Hindus. Their homes and businesses have been bulldozed, and their places of worship set on fire.\\n\\nAt recent campaign rallies, Modi has said Muslims are \"infiltrators\" and that they \"have too many children.\" Without evidence, he has accused the BJP\\'s main rival, the Congress party, of planning to redistribute the wealth of Hindus to Muslims. Many Muslims believe Modi is stoking divisions as a campaign strategy. But who will speak up? If they do, they may be picked up (by police), or a bulldozer will be sent to their homes,\" said Khatri. \"So out of fear, nobody speaks up.\" Not one of India\\'s 28 states has a Muslim as chief minister; the BJP and its allies have chief ministers in 19 states.\\n\\nIn Uttar Pradesh, the country\\'s most populous state and where roughly 16% of residents are Muslim, just 7% of state lawmakers are Muslim. As the BJP becomes ever more powerful, India\\'s opposition parties have become increasingly reluctant to nominate Muslim candidates for fear of alienating Hindu voters, experts say.\\n\\nWhile Hindus overwhelmingly rally around the BJP, Muslims have struggled to form a cohesive political agenda, in part because of how diverse their community is across sects, ethnicities, languages, customs, and cultures.\\n\\nAnalysts say the BJP has made some outreach efforts to Muslims, such as seeking their help as volunteers and at the polls. The party fielded just 13 Muslim candidates combined in the 2014 and 2019 elections, and none were elected. The BJP denies discriminating against Muslim people.\\n\\nThe party \"permits accommodation of all kinds of people, not just the Hindus,\" said M Abdul Salam, the only Muslim out of some 430 BJP candidates running for parliament this year. If he wins, he will become the first Muslim member of the BJP since 2014 in India\\'s lower house of the parliament.\\n\\nSalam, who is from the Muslim-majority southern city of Malappuram, said Muslim politicians from other parties could gain power by joining the BJP\\'s alliance in parliament. But Muslims\\n\\n.Fair representation of every community is suitable for democracy, but one community is gradually being pushed out of the mainstream,\\n\\nThe treatment of Muslims has been a matter of concern in recent years, with reports of discrimination, hate crimes, and violence against this community. There are several reasons why this is the case, including the rise of extremism and the spread of communal hatred.\\n\\nOne reason is the rise of Hindu nationalism, which has led to a toxic political environment where religious and ethnic minorities are a threat to the dominant Hindu majority. This has resulted in the spread of anti-Muslim sentiment and the proliferation of hate speech and violence against Muslims.\\n\\nAnother factor is the spread of misinformation and propaganda, which often reinforces negative stereotypes about Muslims and portrays them as a threat to national security and the Hindu way of life. This has contributed to a hostile and dangerous environment for Muslims and has led to widespread fear and insecurity.\\n\\nExtremism is also a significant factor contributing to the mistreatment of Muslims. The presence of extremist groups who promote hate and violence against religious and ethnic minorities has created an environment of fear and insecurity for these communities. These groups often use hate speech, propaganda, and violence to spread their message, further exacerbating tensions and leading to an increase in hate crimes and violence against Muslims.\\n\\nRight-wing extremist organizations like the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are promoting fascist and authoritarian tendencies through their policies and actions. Indian democracy is eroding over time as a result of widespread public misunderstanding and the suppression of debate over Hindutva\\'s fascist roots. The Bharatiya Janata Party, India\\'s governing party, has never been able to distance itself from debates over the rights of minorities, particularly Muslims.\\n\\nWhile Hindutva organizations have mainly targeted Muslims, they are regrettably not the only ones. Because of pro-Hindu propaganda, Muslims, Christians, and Sikhs are left at the mercy of an authoritarian government to protect their fundamental rights. With the dubious assistance of Hindutva organizations, Narendra Modi\\'s government has consistently repressed the proponents of Khalistan in India.\\n\\nSome BJP leaders have made controversial remarks and statements that suggest a preference for Hindu culture and traditions over other religious traditions. Even the media is often censored, while Article 19 of India\\'s Constitution, which deals with freedom of speech, is ignored. Following the horrific anti-Muslim riots that took place in New Delhi in February 2020, when Muslims protesting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) had to undergo torture at the hands of Hindu gangs, the government suspended a television channel and another for 48 hours following the riots.\\n\\nAfter the BBC ran stories that painted the BJP government and Modi in a negative light, the government raided their offices. The Guardian reports: \"BBC offices in India have been raided by tax department officials, just weeks after the release of a documentary critical of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, which the government later blocked. According to those working at the broadcaster, more than a dozen officials from the country\\'s income tax department turned up at the BBC offices in Delhi and Mumbai, where hundreds of employees are based, to conduct a \\'survey.\\n\\nThe BJP is actively cracking down on free speech and dissent, particularly on social media. There have been cases of journalists being arrested or harassed for reporting critical stories, and there have been efforts to control the narrative in mainstream media.\\n\\nThe BJP is implementing policies that target Muslims, such as the controversial CAA, which fast-tracks citizenship for non-Muslim immigrants from neighbouring countries. The party has also been accused of being complicit in anti-Muslim violence, particularly in the state of Gujarat in 2002. The BJP primarily seeks to control institutions such as the judiciary, media, and educational institutions to further its political agenda. This has led to concerns about the erosion of democratic norms and the independence of these institutions.\\n\\nInstances of mob violence and lynching have been carried out by individuals associated with or influenced by these organizations. For example, in September 2015, Mohammad Akhlaq, a Muslim man, was lynched by a mob in Dadri, Uttar Pradesh, over allegations of slaughtering a cow. Some of the accused individuals were associated with local RSS-affiliated organizations. Moreover, in June 2017, six men were lynched in 2016 in Jharkhand on suspicions of being child kidnappers. Some of the individuals were reportedly associated with the BJP or its youth wing.\\n\\nIn July 2018, Rakbar Khan, a Muslim man, was lynched by a mob in Alwar, Rajasthan, over allegations of cow smuggling. Some of the accused were reportedly associated with a local cow protection group with links to the BJP. In December 2018, a police officer and a civilian were killed in violent clashes in Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh, after a mob attacked a police team over allegations of cow slaughter. Some of the accused individuals were reportedly associated with the BJP.\\n\\nThe mistreatment of Muslims is a complex issue with multiple contributing factors, including the rise of extremism and Hindu nationalism, the spread of misinformation and propaganda, and the presence of extremist groups. the government needs to take action to address these issues, promote religious tolerance, and protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their religion or ethnicity.\\n\\nAn ethnic group is a collection of people who share a culture, a language, and a set of customs. Some ethnic communities banded together in the nineteenth century and declared their nation-states over the areas they occupied. These communities may be ethnically distinct from the rest of society, yet they seek to maintain their identity. They are a small group of people who are clearly different and unusual from the majority.\\n\\nIndia is a multi-religious, multicultural, multi-lingual, and multi-racial society with a unifying theme of peaceful coexistence and ethnic peace that binds us together. India\\'s social plurality is strengthened by the country\\'s unique constitutional ideas of secularism and tolerance. These ideas are enshrined under Article 30 and Article 29, which provide legal protection and promotion of any minority population\\'s rights. The Preamble of the Indian Constitution later defined secularism as its integral part. All minorities in the country are guaranteed fundamental rights. These rights are protected and promoted by independent institutions such as the judiciary, the Human Rights Commission, and the Minorities Commission.\\n\\nReservation of Minority Communities in the Indian Society 一\\n\\nThe protection of religious and ethnic minorities rights is fundamental to India\\'s secular ethos. One of the several clauses in the Indian Constitution that promotes minority rights reserving is Article 30. Article 30 provides guarantees to minorities\\' rights \"to construct and operate educational institutions,\" which aids the government in formulating policies for the success of the education of minorities. The advantage provided to Christian students\\' colleges was challenged in St. Stephen\\'s College v. University of Delhi. The court said that half of the seats would be designated for minorities in the selection process while the other half would be filled on the basis of merit.\\n\\nHowever, the TMA Pai Foundation lawsuit overturned this decision. The Apex Court ruled that unassisted establishments of institutions are not entitled to the state\\'s admission procedures since they do not receive any public funding from the state fund. It meant that schools might follow their admission policy, including administering their entrance exam, as long as the admission was on performance and the system was open and transparent. Similarly, they will the state\\'s fee systems should not restrain them as long as they do not solicit capitation fees. According to the court, the state now has the authority to set quotas for minority pupils. This decision distinguished between government involvement of private entities that are supported and independent.\\n\\nTime again, the Supreme Court ruled in P.A. Inamdar v. State of Maharashtra that the principle of student reservation does not apply to minority establishments of institutions. The government does not have the authority to make reservations in educational establishments. The admissions procedure may be based on an examination or upon merit. The Supreme Court concluded in Azeez Basha v. Union of India (Aligarh Muslim University Case) that a segment of the population has no authority to direct an educational institution that they did not create. According to the Act of Parliament, AMU is not really a minority institution. The terms \\'established\\' and \\'administered\\' must be interpreted carefully. In the case of Dr Naresh Agarwal v. UOI, the court overturned -- the status of minority to AMU.\\n\\nSum & Substance of Minority Groups in India\\n\\nA heritage of confrontations, as well as a dynamic staging ground for sectarian tensions and dissent, have rendered India susceptible to minorities on several grounds and chances. As a result, there is a need to protect their identity and minority rights on social, economic, and political levels. The Indian Constitution gives several avenues for minorities to preserve their rights. In order to maintain its democratic character, it also grants specific rights and freedoms to minorities. Minorities, on the other hand, are responsible for a slew of issues.\\n\\nSupreme Court and minority rights\\n\\nIndia has avowed itself to be a secular state. As a result, our Constitution\\'s spirit is secular. In India, all political leaders profess to be secular, but none of them actually implement it. In India, political parties play a prominent part in delegitimizing religious issues in order to get votes. Despite the fact that there are several difficulties of this nature, the answer lies in approaching with due consideration. Even yet, the court seems to be unable to define minority and has relied on the interpretation of the court based on the facts. Article 30 and Article 29 of the Indian Constitution have a widespread impact, and they must offer the minority portion of their entire freedom. The Supreme Court of India has always done its best to offer minorities the guarantees provided by the Constitution. The Constitution affords the country\\'s minorities ample safeguards for the safety and advancement of the minorities and minority institutions, all of which are guaranteed as fundamental rights. The rights supposedly conferred on the minorities are no more than rights aimed at making India a genuinely democratic secular country and to secure to its citizen\\'s justice -- social, economic, and political; liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship; equality of status and opportunity; and to promote fraternity among them all, assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation, so proudly proclaimed in the Constitution. Religion, language, and culture were the essential elements to be considered with reference to each state to determine the question of whether any section of the population was a minority. This chapter also discusses the constitutional rights accorded to minority educational institutions, including those related to reservations, admissions, appointment of teachers, and disciplinary control. They can run any institution that they see fit.\\n\\nIndia\\'s slide into fascism\\n\\nIndia is slowly sliding into fascism. The problem with \"fascism\" as a description of any modern political tendency is that the term is a weapon of mass destruction that flattens the landscapes that it wants to describe. Fascism is so freighted with historically specific meaning that using it for other times and places can seem sloppy and excessive. And yet, juxtaposing the politics of contemporary South Asia with fascism, in its Nazi variant, serves a double purpose: it connects modern Indian majoritarianism with one of its ideological ancestors, and it helps us name and identify the ideological kernel of fascism that survived to fight another day.\\n\\nIndia\\'s ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is the political arm of a Hindu militia, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), founded in 1925, around the time Adolf Hitler began to find his political bearings in a routed, angry Germany. The RSS is a nationalist militia that defines India as a Hindu nation; only Hindus can be members. While there are many similarities between the RSS and the fascist paramilitary organizations of the prewar decades, from uniformed drills and distinctive salutes to persistent anxiety about masculinity, at the core of both is a feral ethnic nationalism that aims to mobilize a racial or religious majority against an allegedly infringing minority.\\n\\nWe have become familiar with violence and discrimination directed at minority religious groups in India, particularly Muslims, through this last decade of majoritarian rule. Lynchings connected to the cattle trade, riots, the bulldozing of Muslim homes, and the criminalization of love between Hindu women and Muslim men via the bogey of \"love jihad\" have been features of Narendra Modi\\'s tenure as prime minister. But the German inspiration for the BJP\\'s short way with minorities goes back to the 1930s.'}\n",

Above all, peace!\\n\\nPeace in Ukraine - a just peace in line with the UN Charter, international law and General Assembly resolutions.\\n\\nPeace in Gaza -- with an immediate cease-fire, the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, the effective and unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid, and the beginning of an irreversible process towards a two-State solution.\\n\\nPeace in Lebanon -- with an immediate cessation of hostilities, and the full implementation of Security Council resolutions.\\n\\nPeace in Sudan -- with all parties silencing their guns and committing to a path towards sustainable peace.\\n\\nEverywhere, we must uphold the values of the UN Charter and International Law, including the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence of all States.\\n\\nExcellencies,\\n\\nThe absence of peace is leading to an erosion of trust.\\n\\nIn the multilateral system, in societies, and in one another.\\n\\nRebuilding trust is our essential task.\\n\\nAnd this makes the work of the Alliance of Civilizations more important than ever.\\n\\nI see four crucial areas where we must expand our efforts -- in communities, online, across cultures and institutions.\\n\\nFirst, we need to build communities of trust and belonging.\\n\\nThese are the foundation of more peaceful, just and resilient societies, based on human rights and dignity for all.\\n\\nBuilding trust and cohesion cannot be done by governments or institutions alone.\\n\\nWe need voices and action across all levels, including grassroots organisations, marginalised communities, local authorities and religious groups.\\n\\nThe role of religious leaders is especially crucial.\\n\\nWe need meaningful participation of women in decision-making, including in leadership positions.\\n\\nAnd we need to spotlight the vital voices of young people.\\n\\nI commend you for pioneering initiatives on strengthening the role of women as peacemakers.\\n\\nAnd I welcome the many alumni of your youth programs here today -- including from the Youth Solidarity Fund and the Intercultural Innovation Hub.\\n\\nSecond, we must reign in hate speech and disinformation spreading online.\\n\\nHate-filled frenzies are perpetuating stereotypes and misconceptions.\\n\\nMisinformation and outright lies are fueling repulsive antisemitism, anti-Muslim bigotry and attacks on minority Christian communities, among others.\\n\\nThese are old tactics with a new medium.\\n\\nUnchecked digital platforms and Artificial Intelligence have endowed hate speech with a speed and reach unseen before.\\n\\nThe worst impulses of humanity are given a megaphone, and many times they lead to violence.\\n\\nWith the proliferation of deepfakes, the impossible and the unverified become credible in an instant.\\n\\nBut we do have constructive ways to address these and other challenges.\\n\\nFor example, through the United Nations Global Principles for Information Integrity which have put forward recommendations for a more humane information ecosystem.\\n\\nCountries also adopted a major new initiative -- the Global Digital Compact -- which is aimed at fostering a safe and secure digital space that respects and protects human rights.\\n\\nI also welcome the Alliance\\'s \"Plural Plus\" joint initiative with the International Organization for Migration.\\n\\nThrough the initiative, young media and filmmakers explore the topic of migration and social inclusion, and provide a counter narrative to the negative portrayal of migrants and refugees.\\n\\nBut the buck does not stop with these efforts.\\n\\nBig tech companies, advertisers, and media outlets must take responsibility for their role.\\n\\nThe Global Digital Compact also emphasizes the importance of supporting cultural diversity in the digital space.\\n\\nThat leads me to the third area - working harder to fully embrace the role of culture and cultural diversity to advance all our goals.\\n\\nSocieties today are multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural.\\n\\nThis diversity is a richness and our greatest strength, not a threat.\\n\\nRespecting and representing all cultures builds trust in society.\\n\\nAnd at a time of spreading hatred and intolerance, we must not only defend diversity but we must invest in it.\\n\\nHarnessed effectively, cultural diversity can be a powerhouse of ideas and innovation.\\n\\nFourth, rebuilding trust calls for institutions that are more representative.\\n\\nMore representative institutions mean more effective institutions.\\n\\nYet today, multilateral peace and security tools, and the global financial architecture, are products of a bygone era.\\n\\nThe Security Council is outdated and frequently paralysed.\\n\\nMeanwhile the International Financial Architecture does not reflect today\\'s economy and has become inadequate and unfair.\\n\\nWe need to keep working to strengthen global governance - and that is precisely the central tenet of the Pact for the Future -- adopted by consensus at the United Nations in September.\\n\\nIt calls for decisive steps towards updating and reforming international cooperation to make it more networked, fair and inclusive.\\n\\nThe Pact also reinforces the call of the Alliance for inclusive, just societies rooted in human rights, respect for religious communities, and intercultural dialogue.\\n\\nExcellencies and friends,\\n\\nIn these turbulent times, too many people are convinced that differences must define us.\\n\\nBut the most powerful force of all is the recognition that we are more united by our common fate than divided by our distinct identities.\\n\\nThat is the essence of the United Nations - and the raison d\\'être of the Alliance of Civilizations.\\n\\nLet\\'s stand together with our shared faith in humanity.\\n\\nOne planet.\\n\\nOne human family.\\n\\nRich in diversity.\\n\\nEqual in dignity and rights.\\n\\nAnd united in solidarity.\\n\\nI thank all of you for your leadership and commitment.'}\n",

This climate of hostility is characterized by systemic discrimination, violent assaults, and state-sanctioned actions against Muslim communities.\\n\\nRecently, Muslim victims have urged the Indian Supreme Court to intervene against the arbitrary demolition of properties owned by Muslims, a practice dubbed \"Bulldozer Justice\" that targets alleged illegal structures under the pretext of urban development. This trend reflects a broader pattern of violence and discrimination including the recent sentencing of Muslim converts under anti-conversion laws which stifles their religious freedom and autonomy.\\n\\nExperts from the third ministerial conference of Justice for All (JFA) have warned that rising Islamophobia could lead to genocide against Muslims in India. This sentiment is echoed in various protests such as those against housing for Muslim single mothers which reveal deep rooted institutionalized bigotry within Modi\\'s regime. The violent assaults on Muslims during Ramadan prayers at Gujarat University further illustrate their vulnerability in a country that claims to uphold secular values.\\n\\nIn Gujarat, Muslims face exclusion from housing in Hindu dominated areas, perpetuating a form of modern-day apartheid. The Indian government has suppressed dissenting voices from religious minorities through surveillance and harassment, often utilizing laws like the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) to stifle advocacy efforts. High profile BJP member Gyan Dev Ahuja have incited violence against Muslims by calling for the killing of anyone involved in slaughter of cow, which exacerbated communal tensions across states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\nViolent assaults on Muslims during Ramadan prayers at Gujarat University illustrate their vulnerability in a country that claims to uphold secular values.\\n\\nRenowned Bollywood actor turned BJP leader Mithun Chakraborty made ferocious statements cum threats against Muslims. He made a statement against a Muslim TMC leader stating \"If you throw in the Bhagirathi, we will also one day... not in the Bhagirathi because it is our mother... but we will bury you on the other side. Aap hamare jhaad ka ek fal todoge toh hum aapke jhaad ka char fal tod denge\"\\n\\nFurther he stated, \"In 2026 (the next Assembly elections), the masnad (throne) will be ours (the BJP\\'s) and we will do everything to achieve the goal... Kuch bhi karenge, kuch bhi. Main Home Minister sahab ke saamne bol raha hoon. Kuch bhi ke andar bahut sara matlab chupa hua hai\"\\n\\nRecent reports indicate a troubling rise in hate speech incidents against Muslims in India, particularly linked to the ruling Baharatiya Janata Party (BJP). A report by Hindutva Watch documented 255 incidents of hate speech targeting Muslims with approximately 80 percent of these incidents occurring in states governed by the BJP during the first half of 2023. A significant portion of documented hate speech incidents, approximately one-third, has been attributed to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and the Bajrang Dal.\\n\\nCIA has categorized both these groups as \"religious militant organizations\". Both VHP & Bajran Dal are linked to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) which serves as the ideological foundation for the Baharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This alarming situation highlights a significant trend in the politicization of communal tensions under Modi\\'s administration which has been criticized for fostering an environment where such rhetoric is increasingly normalized. Later on, BJP government has blocked platforms tracking hate crimes like Hindutva Watch and India Hate Lab under controversial IT act, 2000.\\n\\nSocial media plays a significant role in fueling Islamophobia with platforms facilitating the spread of hate speech and disinformation. Reports indicate that nearly two anti-Muslim hate speech incidents occur daily, with many linked to political campaigns led by the BJP. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) further marginalize Muslims by putting hundreds of thousands at risk of statelessness, particularly in Assam.\\n\\nThe destruction of property in predominantly Muslim neighborhoods has intensified under BJP rule, contributing to increased religious tensions. Civil society organizations have approached the Supreme Court to halt these demolitions and protect minority rights.\\n\\nThe international community is urged to demand action against rising Islamophobia and advocate for protective measures for minority communities in India. Furthermore, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) must organize campaigns addressing housing discrimination against Muslim single mothers and promote inclusive policies. World governing bodies should compel the Indian government to ensure protection for minorities during religious observances.\\n\\nThe plight of Muslim women illustrates an intersection of gender and religious discrimination as they face harassment at both local and state levels. The ongoing violence not only threatens their safety but also fuels existing inequalities within society.\\n\\nIn short, Islamophobia in India manifests through systemic discrimination, violent acts against Muslims, and state-supported initiatives that undermine their rights. The urgent need for civil society mobilization against discriminatory laws like the CAA and NRC is paramount to safeguarding citizenship rights for Muslims. As tensions rise, it is crucial for both domestic and international actors to advocate for justice and equality for all religious communities in India.'}\n",

The complaints highlight hate speech delivered by habitual hate offenders during the election period, urging the Chief Election Officer (CEO) S. Chockalingam to direct registration of FIRs under Sections 123(2), 123(3), and 123(3A) of the Representation of People\\'s Act, 1951. Three of the complaints were filed against Suresh Chavhanke, the editor-in-chief of Sudarshan News, for his inflammatory speeches in Jalgaon (Nov 8), Akola (Nov 13), and Pathanpura (Nov 11). Another complaint accuses Harsha Thakur of making divisive comments in Delgur (Nanded) on October 29, while the fifth complaint involves BJP Rajya Sabha MP Dhananjay Mahadik for his communal speech during an election rally in Kolhapur. These actions, CJP claims, violated MCC guidelines and electoral laws.\\n\\nOn November 15, 2024, CJP filed a complaint before the CEO Maharashtra regarding the gross violation of MCC in Jalgaon, Maharashtra, due to the hate-filled rhetoric of Suresh Chavhanke. Chavhanke\\'s speech at the Janata-NRC event blatantly violated the MCC and undermined the principles of free and fair elections as pleaded by the CJP in its complaint. The said speech was delivered by Suresh Chavhanke at the Janta-NRC event on November 8, 2024, in Jalgaon, Maharashtra.\\n\\nIn his address, Chavhanke explicitly targeted Muslim citizens by misrepresenting Islamic symbols, falsely claiming that the crescent and star, often associated with Islam, belonged not to Islam but to the Muslim League, and linking it to the creation of Pakistan. He further propagated misinformation by associating the true Islamic flag with extremist ideologies. Referring to Muslims as \"infiltrators\" and calling for their removal to \"save Maharashtra,\" he sought to fuel communal tensions. Additionally, he promoted the baseless \"Vote Jihad\" conspiracy, accusing Muslims of using elections to wage a religious war, inciting division and hostility.\\n\\nCJP mentioned in its complaint that \"This statement is highly provocative and anti-Muslim because it labels Muslims as \"infiltrators\" and associates them with a threat to India\\'s integrity. The call to \"drive out the infiltrators\" implies that Muslims are unwelcome outsiders, fostering fear and hatred. The comparison of the saffron flag to the Tricolor and the assertion that without saffron, the Tricolor will \"turn green\" insinuates that Muslims, symbolized by green, pose a threat to national unity. Furthermore, the term \"vote Jihad\" equates Muslim political participation to religious warfare, encouraging communal hostility and framing elections as a religious battle, thus deepening divisions.\\n\\nThe video can be accessed through this link: https: https://t.me/hindutvawatchin/802\\n\\n2. Akola [November 13, 2024] & 3. Pathanpura (Mangrulpir) [November 11, 2024]\\n\\nSpeaker - Suresh Chavhanke\\n\\nOn November 21, 2024, CJP filed a complaint regarding the hate-filled speeches delivered by Suresh Chavhanke, editor-in-chief of Sudarshan News, in Akola and Pathanpura (Mangrulpir), Maharashtra. Chavhanke\\'s speeches, delivered on November 13, 2024, in Akola and November 11, 2024, in Pathanpura, contained clear examples of hate speech, particularly targeting the Muslim community. Throughout his speeches, Chavhanke used derogatory terms like \"love jihad,\" \"intruders,\" and \"jihadists,\" portraying Muslims as a threat to national security and fueling fear by labeling them as \"infiltrators\" from neighboring countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Myanmar.\\n\\nFurthermore, Chavhanke invoked historical figures such as \"Aurangzeb\" and \"Tipu Sultan\" to vilify Muslims, manipulating religious sentiments to create division. He also urged voters to support laws targeting Muslims, including \"cow protection\" and the baseless \"love jihad\" conspiracy. This inflammatory rhetoric was designed to incite hatred and polarize communities. CJP\\'s complaint highlighted that Chavhanke\\'s speeches violated the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) and sections 123(2), 123(3), and 123(3A) of the Representation of the People Act (RP Act), 1951, which prohibit hate speech and the incitement of religious division during election periods, as per CJP\\'s complaint.\\n\\nCJP said in its complaint that, \"By linking political choices to religious identity and inciting voters to act against Muslim communities, the speaker attempts to polarize the election along religious lines. The call to vote based on laws like \"love jihad\" or \"cow protection\" further encourages discrimination, suggesting that the Muslim community is responsible for crimes against Hindu women or society. This creates a hostile, divisive atmosphere, undermining the principles of free and fair elections.\"\\n\\nOn November 21, 2024, CJP filed a complaint regarding the anti-Muslim and communal hate speech delivered by right-wing leader Harsha Thakur at a public event in Delgur, Nanded, Maharashtra. Thakur, campaigning for independent Hindu nationalist candidate Dr. Virupaksha Maharaj, made inflammatory remarks that blatantly violated the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) and undermined free and fair elections. On October 29, 2024, Thakur\\'s speech contained divisive rhetoric, calling for Hindus to avoid supporting those who allegedly sided with other religious communities.\\n\\nShe warned that if Sharia law were implemented, valuable land would be transferred to the Waqf Board, inciting fear and communal tension. Thakur further urged voters to prioritize religious unity over caste-based voting. Her comments, intended to stoke division, violated MCC provisions by inciting religious hatred and manipulating religious sentiments for electoral gain. CJP emphasized that these statements contravened Sections 123(2), 123(3), and 123(3A) of the Representation of the People Act (RP Act), 1951.\\n\\nAccording to CJP\\'s complaint in her speech, Thakur urged voters that, \"Don\\'t vote for a candidate who gives employment to Muslims!\" and further stated, \"India will never work on Sharia law,\" while also spreading unfounded fears about the Waqf Board. This rhetoric is not only inflammatory but also divisive, promoting religious intolerance and fear-mongering. By appealing to voters on religious lines and stoking fear about Muslims and their institutions, Thakur\\'s speech creates a dangerous environment of communal polarization.\"\\n\\nThe video can be accessed through this link: https: https://t.me/hindutvawatchin/825\\n\\nOn November 15, 2024, CJP approached the CEO Maharashtra with a complaint against BJP Rajya Sabha MP Dhananjay Mahadik, following his controversial remarks at a rally in Kolhapur, Maharashtra. In a video that surfaced, Mahadik was seen instructing party workers to target women beneficiaries of the Ladki Bahini Yojana attending Congress rallies. He directed his supporters to photograph or film these women and report back to him. His statement, \"I will teach those women a lesson,\" was a clear attempt to intimidate and surveil women based on their political affiliations. These actions were seen as an explicit violation of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) and the Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1951.\\n\\nCJP argued that Mahadik\\'s directive not only threatened women\\'s rights to political participation but also used a government welfare scheme intended for empowerment as a tool for political control. The complaint called for immediate action under electoral laws to address this form of intimidation.\\n\\nThe video can be accessed through this link: https://x.com/HateDetectors/status/1856274208646672512\\n\\nNotably, CJP played a pivotal role in monitoring the assembly elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, vigilantly flagging complaints of hate speech and violations of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC). Their persistent efforts resulted in the registration of FIRs against Suresh Chavhanke and Kajal Hindustani in Maharashtra for delivering inflammatory speeches that breached MCC guidelines.\\n\\nRelated:\\n\\nCJP files 3 MCC violation complaints with CEO Maharashtra against Suresh Chavhanke for hate speech\\n\\nCJP\\'s fight against Hate: FIR filed against Suresh Chavhanke for Hate Speech at Karad event'}\n",

The complaint, submitted on November 11, accused Chavhanke of delivering a hate-filled, anti-Muslim speech at the Janata-NRC event on October 22, 2024. CJP\\'s complaint highlighted how the speech violated the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) by inciting religious hatred and political division. Chavhanke has been booked under Section 123(3A) of the Representation of People Act, 1951, for violating MCC during the event, with FIR No. 1544 of 2024 filed.\\n\\nThe Event and the Complaint\\n\\nThe Janata-NRC event, organized on October 22, 2024 by the right-wing outfit Sakal Hindu Samaj in Karad, was the venue for Chavhanke\\'s controversial address. The CJP complaint highlighted that Chavhanke\\'s speech, laden with Islamophobic and divisive content, not only violated ethical standards of political discourse but also breached the MCC, which governs the conduct of political leaders during the election period.\\n\\nIn the speech, Chavhanke allegedly claimed that Europe would soon cease to exist due to a Muslim takeover, making inflammatory statements about the growing Muslim population in India. He further propagated the debunked \"love jihad\" conspiracy theory and stated that India was at risk from \"10 crore infiltrators,\" referring to Muslims as a threat to Hindu culture and suggesting that they should be expelled from the country. These remarks, according to the CJP, were designed to create fear, manipulate public sentiment, and divide communities along religious lines.\\n\\nCJP\\'s complaint, while condemning the hate speech, also referenced a recent FIR filed in Thane against another individual, Kajal Hindustani, for delivering a similar hate speech.\\n\\nKey Allegations in the Speech\\n\\nThe complaint provides an in-depth analysis of Chavhanke\\'s speech, citing several excerpts that they argued violated the legal framework meant to ensure a fair and peaceful election process. The speech, according to the complaint, sought to create a sense of insecurity among Hindus by presenting Muslims as a demographic threat, manipulating fears about rising Muslim populations, and linking this to supposed threats like \"Love Jihad\" and \"Land Jihad.\"\\n\\nOne of the most controversial claims made by Chavhanke was the assertion that India faced a crisis of \"infiltrators,\" with an estimated 10 crore illegal Muslim immigrants in the country. He further suggested that the growing Muslim population would soon make Hindus a minority in several states by 2048. His remarks regarding Muslims being an \"economic burden\" on the nation and his demand for their expulsion were, according to the CJP, an incitement to religious hatred.\\n\\nChavhnake said in his speech that, \"There are 10 crore intruders sitting in India. 1 crore in Maharashtra. 40 lakhs in Mumbai. 3.5 lakhs in your district. Infiltrators, those who came into the country without permission. Illegal citizens. Get this illegal citizen out now. Is it legal to say so or not? Is it morally right or not? Practical or not? Because all this money is a burden on this country from an economic point of view. It is also from a cultural point of view. From a social point of view, India is also burdened by this.

Several training activities had been held to improve State authorities\\' response to hate crimes.\\n\\nPolice personnel were obliged to respect human rights and perform their duties based on respect for individuals, the delegation said. Over 1,000 cases of police misdemeanours had been conveyed to the Ombudsman, and around 660 disciplinary sanctions had been implemented.\\n\\nThe delegation said the Hellenic Coast Guard\\'s practices followed international law. Protecting human life at sea and aiding those in distress, without any form of discrimination, was the highest duty of the Coast Guard. All allegations of pushbacks were appropriately investigated by monitoring bodies. The Coast Guard had saved and continued to save thousands of lives at sea. From 2013, Coast Guard officers had been trained in basic human rights principles.\\n\\nIn concluding remarks, Mr. Diaby thanked the delegation for the dialogue, which had been intensive, fruitful, frank and necessary. The questions raised by the Committee aimed to assess progress in the implementation of the Convention to help the Committee to develop recommendations that were helpful to Greece.\\n\\nIn his concluding remarks, Ioannis Ghikas, Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said the dialogue had been intense but constructive, identifying issues that the State party needed to address. The State was proud of the progress it had made since the last review, including in protecting the rights of asylum seekers and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons.\\n\\nThe delegation of Greece consisted of representatives of the Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family Affairs; Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Ministry of Interior; Ministry of Education, Religious Affairs and Sports; Ministry of Health; Ministry of Citizen Protection; Ministry of Labour and Social Security; Ministry of Justice; Ministry of Migration and Asylum; Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Insular Policy; Hellenic Labour Inspectorate; Presidency of the Government; and the Permanent Mission of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva.\\n\\nThe Committee will issue its concluding observations on the report of Greece after the conclusion of its one hundred and fourteenthOpens in new window session on 13 December.

Summaries of the public meetings of the Committee can be found here, while webcasts of the public meetings can be found hereOpens in new window.\\n\\nThe Committee will next meet in public on Wednesday, 4 December at 3 p.m. to consider the combined eighth and ninth periodic report of Kenya (CERD/C/KEN/8-9Opens in new window).\\n\\nReport\\n\\nThe Committee has before it the combined twenty-third and twenty-fourth periodic report of Greece (CERD/C/GRC/23-24Opens in new window).\\n\\nPresentation of Report\\n\\nIOANNIS GHIKAS, Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said the dialogue would highlight the progress Greece had made. The State party had taken significant initiatives to combat racial discrimination, including by implementing the national action plan on preventing racism and intolerance, laws combatting hate speech, and training programmes for law enforcement officials. The State party had also adopted a national action plan on preventing anti-Semitism and had made efforts to promote the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, including by implementing legislation on same-sex marriage.\\n\\nProgress had been made despite the decade-long economic crisis that Greece had been facing. The racist \"Golden Dawn\" organization had been banned from participating in political activities and its leaders had been imprisoned. Civil society continued to support the State party\\'s efforts to prevent racism and intolerance. There was much work to be done, but Greece was committed to addressing the issues it faced, and looked forward to the recommendations of the Committee.\\n\\nAIKATERINI PATSOGIANNI, Secretary General of Equality and Human Rights, Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family Affairs of Greece and head of the delegation, said that since the last review, Greece had been advancing toward long-term sustainable economic progress, supporting its human rights and anti-racism framework. In the fight against racism, police authorities had developed standards and guidance in areas such as training and capacity building of law enforcement, improved recording and collection of data on hate crimes, as well as cooperation between law enforcement and civil society organizations, and ways to address underreporting. The judicial system responded to organizations that exploited the economic crisis and the resulting fractures to the social fabric to commit criminal racist acts, while the legislature took measures to protect and safeguard the democratic electoral process from such criminal organizations.\\n\\nThe National Council against Racism and Intolerance, in which independent bodies also participated, adopted its first national action plan in December 2020. Efforts for the second action plan were underway, with funding secured for a results-driven agenda. In this regard, the State party was ready to work with relevant stakeholders, including the Racist Violence Recording Network.\\n\\nGreece was actively implementing the National Strategy on the Roma 2021-2030, guided by the principle of \"for the Roma, with the Roma.\" Key committees, including the independent Roma Forum, were fully operational. All available European Union funding was used to enhance the Roma\\'s employment, education, healthcare and housing.\\n\\nOn migration, modernised reception facilities ensured dignified conditions and targeted care for vulnerable groups, while a robust system supported unaccompanied minors. The Asylum Service had significantly improved in efficiency. The \"HELIOS\" project and legal reforms promoted integration and labour market access. Enhanced international cooperation also provided pathways for organised, legal migration.\\n\\nBorder protection was carried out in line with domestic, European and international law. Protecting human life at sea and aiding those in distress, without any form of discrimination, was the highest duty of the Hellenic Coast Guard. Allegations of violations of the principle of non-refoulement were inconsistent with the operational activities of the competent agencies. The State had put in place a multi-level policy for the effective monitoring of fundamental rights. The Hellenic Coast Guard had saved and continued to save thousands of lives at sea.\\n\\nGreece had ratified International Labour Organization Convention 190 to create a work environment free from violence and harassment. Public authorities detected and protected all trafficking victims, without discrimination, in line with the principles of the Office of the National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings and the National Referral Mechanism.\\n\\nInclusive education was promoted through various initiatives and teacher training programmes. Key efforts included the \"Active Citizens\\' Actions\" curriculum supporting the Sustainable Development Goals, a 2023 anti-bullying law with a reporting platform, a mobile phone ban to reduce cyberbullying, and the introduction of \"Digital School\" and \"Skills Lab\" to enhance digital learning.\\n\\nThe State party had also established an independent Committee of Deontology, aimed at countering all types of expression in printed and electronic media that incited, promoted, spread or justified violence, hatred or discriminatory speech. Human rights education, training and awareness-raising activities, including for law enforcement personnel and members of the judiciary, remained top priorities.\\n\\nQuestions by a Committee Expert\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, thanked Greece for supporting the candidacy of Greek Expert Stamatia Stavrinaki to the Committee, who made remarkable contributions to its work.\\n\\nCould the delegation provide information on the ethnic makeup of the population and of asylum seekers and refugees living in the State party? The Committee was concerned by the general lack of disaggregated data on racial discrimination. What measures were in place to implement a comprehensive data collection system?\\n\\nWhat measures had the State party taken to address excessive use of force by the police? There had been several allegations of such excessive use of force against minorities. How was the State party ensuring that all allegations were properly investigated, perpetrators punished, and victims granted reparations?\\n\\nThere was a limited number of convictions for cases involving racial discrimination and official data on cases reported to the police was not accessible to the public. The Committee was concerned that the new anti-racist law was not fully in line with the requirements of article four of the Convention as it did not criminalise the dissemination of ideas of racial superiority or prohibit racist organizations. What measures were in place to revise legislation to ensure that all incitement to racial, ethnic and religious hatred was criminalised and that perpetrators were punished? How had the police\\'s capacity to investigate racist crimes and to combat racist violence been increased? State services reportedly did not provide appropriate, timely support to victims of racist violence, who relied on support from civil society. Was a referral system for victims to State services being developed?\\n\\nOver the reporting period, there had been 89 reported cases of racism targeting asylum seekers and refugees. The Committee welcomed the various legislative measures undertaken to address racism. Were there gaps in the implementation of legislation on racism? Was there a media regulatory body that held journalists to account when they disseminated racist notions?\\n\\nWas the State party drafting a new national action plan to combat racism and intolerance? What results had the last action plan achieved? The National Council against Racism and Intolerance had been reactivated in 2024. What measures were in place to ensure that the Council could work effectively?\\n\\nWhy had there been delays in the registration of civil society organizations claiming to have minority status? Some minority associations had been dissolved; could the delegation comment on this?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece did not collect statistical data based on race and religious affiliations due to its protection of the right to privacy. Statistical data was collected on specific categories of beneficiaries of State policies, such as policies for the Roma. Data was also collected on the demographics of prison inmates, and on migrants, asylum seekers and refugees according to European Union regulations. A unified information system for reception and asylum was being developed. Data on migrants\\' gender, ethnicity and religion was collected.\\n\\nAfter 2015, there was an amendment to legislation concerning the punishment of hate crimes that facilitated the investigation and prosecution of cases by eliminating the need to prove the standard of \"hate\". Data from the judiciary and the Public Prosecutor showed that there had been better implementation of hate crime legislation in recent years. The State party also had legislation on hate speech and incitement to hatred that addressed speech inciting racial superiority.\\n\\n\"Golden Dawn\" was not allowed to participate in elections and State funding to it had been suspended. All political parties that acted as proxies for persons who had committed racist hate crimes were prohibited, and on this basis two political parties had recently been banned from participating in elections.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said human rights defenders were sometimes accused and condemned without having the opportunity to defend themselves. Did the State party intend to adopt special legislation to protect human rights defenders? Several dozens of cases of refoulement involving Greece had been examined by the European Court of Human Rights. Were border police trained on the handling of migrants? What aid had been provided to victims of police violence?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said that although the European Union directive on victim support had been incorporated into national legislation, there were allegations that the directive was not sufficiently applied, leading to impunity for perpetrators of racist acts. How did the State party collect data on foreign nationals in the prison system? What recommendations had been provided by the Racist Violence Reporting Network to the State and had these been implemented?\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert asked about the effectiveness of State policies. How many of the cases of police misconduct reported had resulted in sanctions? How many committees reviewing journalistic ethics had members of racial minority groups?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece had permitted the reopening of domestic court proceedings after decisions on three cases by the European Court of Human Rights. A committee of independent experts had been established to develop strategies for the implementation of the European Court\\'s decisions.\\n\\nPolice personnel were obliged to respect human rights and perform their duties based on respect for individuals. They needed to avoid prejudice based on distinguishing characteristics. The Hellenic Police transmitted relevant information to an independent Ombudsman concerning cases involving discrimination. Over 1,000 cases of police misdemeanours had been conveyed to the Ombudsman, and around 660 disciplinary sanctions had been implemented. Several cases related to racist actions by the police.\\n\\nThe law on audiovisual media services prohibited the dissemination of hate speech based on race and other characteristics. The National Media Advisory Authority had the competence to impose sanctions for disseminating hate speech through online and offline media. All print and online media needed to meet requirements related to the Journalistic Code of Ethics, which included prohibitions of hate speech. The Journalistic Ethics Committee was mandated to investigate all allegations of discriminatory speech. Its members were not appointed based on their ethnicity or sex but were journalists and academics.\\n\\nIn Greece, persons with low income could apply for free legal aid. Legal aid was also provided to victims in trafficking cases and to female victims of violence. Measures were in place to protect victims from secondary victimisation in legal proceedings. All victims were informed of their rights, including the right to compensation.\\n\\nThe Greek legislative framework did not have a specific law for the protection of human rights defenders; all persons were equal before the law.\\n\\nPrivate funding of political parties was strictly forbidden in Greece. Only State funding was legal for political parties. This was why State funding had been suspended for parties that engaged in hate crimes and hate speech.\\n\\nQuestions by a Committee Expert\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said not all incidents of racism were reported by victims, allegedly due to a lack of confidence in the authorities. What measures were in place to strengthen confidence in the justice system among citizens? Did the State party intend to establish an efficient data collection system on racist violence? How would it promote access to justice for victims of racial discrimination? How many complaints of racist hate speech and hate crimes had been received by the State and how many perpetrators had been prosecuted? In how many court cases had the Convention been cited? What measures had the State party taken to encourage the participation of civil society in the implementation of the Convention? Racism continued to be prevalent in the Attica region and in centres where refugees and asylum seekers were located. Did the State party intend to accept the Committee\\'s communications procedure?\\n\\nDiscrimination against minorities by authorities persisted. What recent educational initiatives had been implemented to combat intolerance and prejudice and promote intercultural dialogue? The State party had received the Global Education Award for establishing the Skills Lab, which promoted ethnic tolerance. Was this implemented in all regions of the State party and at all levels?\\n\\nThe Committee commended the State party for its efforts to create memorials of the Holocaust. There were 158 attacks based on religion recorded in 2023. What measures were in place to ensure efficient investigations of these incidents and to develop protection measures? There had also been an increase in cases of vandalism of religious sites and profanation in recent years. What measures were in place to put an end to these practices?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the police code of conduct required police to act with empathy toward vulnerable people. The State party collected data on hate speech and hate crimes, including data on racially motivated crimes.\\n\\nIn Greek prisons, data was collected on nationality. Foreigners from 101 nationalities made up 50 per cent of the prison population. These were persons who were convicted and serving these sentences in Greek prisons. Greece was on the crossroads of many routes, and many people in prisons in Greece were engaged in cross-border criminal activity.\\n\\nThe Ombudsperson received discrimination complaints. Racial discrimination complaints made up seven per cent of complaints received in 2023, up from two per cent in 2022. The labour inspectorate examined complaints of workplace discrimination. The inspectorate was empowered to instigate administrative sanctions. Three cases it investigated in 2023 involved discrimination on the grounds of nationality.\\n\\nThe police had established specialised departments to address violent hate crimes and hate speech and provide support to victims in Attica and the Eastern Aegean region. A hotline and online form for reporting hate crimes had been implemented, and several campaigns were underway on online hate speech. The police force was cooperating with civil society, which provided training to upgrade the capacities of police staff.\\n\\nThe Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure had been revised to make them more victim centred. Courts had been redistributed to improve citizens\\' access across the State. Domestic violence legislation had also been modernised.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, asked for statistics on victims of discrimination who had benefitted from free legal aid. There was a large gap between the records of racist violence of the Racist Violence Reporting NetworkOpens in new window and the Government. Why was this? On what basis was the second national action plan on addressing racism being devised?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said that it was quite shocking that 50 per cent of prisoners in Greece were non-nationals.\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert said that the State\\'s regulations on the provision of legal aid appeared to limit access to it. Would it consider implementing a system of reviewing all requests for legal aid, regardless of the type of crime?\\n\\nA Committee Expert asked whether the labour inspectorate assigned fines for workplace discrimination. Why were non-nationals in Attica most impacted by racist crimes? How did the State party apply the recommendations of the Racist Violence Reporting Network? The Expert welcomed the guide on reporting hate crimes. Were victims made aware of this guide?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the national action plan against racism and intolerance focused on addressing hate crimes, empowering minorities, and eliminating discrimination based on various characteristics. One key initiative was the guide for victims on reporting hate crimes, which had been translated into nine languages and distributed to migrant reception centres and published online. Several training activities had been held to improve State authorities\\' response to hate crimes.\\n\\nThe National Council against Racism and Intolerance had held meetings with civil society to develop the second national action plan on addressing racism and intolerance. It had secured funding to improve victims\\' access to State services. The Council would review the Committee\\'s recommendations and include them in the second national action plan, which would focus on strengthening data collection on hate crimes and developing more services for victims.\\n\\nThe Skills Lab initiative had been piloted nationwide. New curricula promoted human rights education and intercultural communication. Training courses were offered for teachers on human rights and inclusion. A digital platform for reporting school bullying and violence had been launched. As of April 2024, over 700 reports had been received, 10 per cent of which related to racism.\\n\\nVarious actions had been taken to provide education about the Holocaust. Greece was one of the first countries to return the property of victims of the Holocaust. The State collected data on vandalism of religious sites. In 2015, 147 cases were recorded.\\n\\nThe procedure for applying for free legal aid was very simple. Applicants needed only to supply documents proving that they had low income. Victims of almost all crimes could apply for this aid. Lawyers could be appointed for defendants in serious crimes with punishments of five years imprisonment or more.\\n\\nOn some occasions, victims of racist violence went to the Racist Violence Reporting Network but not to public authorities. In 2023, 115 cases had been opened by authorities. There was not a big gap between the number of cases collected by authorities and by the Network. More than half of the population lived in Attica. This was why most racist crimes were reported in this region.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said 18 per cent of asylum camp residents did not enjoy basic material conditions, including food and financial assistance. There were only 29 doctors, 92 nurses and 69 interpreters deployed across all the camps, some of which had more than 1,000 residents. What measures were in place to improve the situation in the camps and ensure that the detention of foreign nationals was only done as a last resort? How was the State party ensuring access to interpretation services for foreign nationals? What efforts had been made to develop a statelessness establishment procedure? How was the State party addressing barriers to refugees accessing official documents?\\n\\nWhat steps had been taken to investigate alleged violations of human rights in the context of border management and to prevent such violations? Was there regular independent surveillance of border forces and efforts to strengthen their capacity? Since March 2020, a significant deterioration had been noted in the security and safety of persons from third countries seeking asylum in the east of Greece. There had been reports of summary forced return of persons who had entered from Türkiye, secret detention without sufficient safeguards, confiscation of personal effects, and intrusive searches. There were also reports of private individuals towing and removing engines from asylum seekers\\' boats, and assisting officials in carrying out forced returns.\\n\\nGreece had not signed the statelessness convention and the Presidential decree on the statelessness determination procedure had not been promulgated. Around 3,740 people in Greece had stated that they had no nationality. What measures would the State party take to better address the issue of statelessness?\\n\\nThe Committee had previously expressed concern regarding low salaries and long working hours for migrant workers, particularly in the agricultural sector. What measures were in place to improve the situation of migrant workers? Was there a safe and accessible way of filing complaints related to workplace discrimination? What measures were in place to support undocumented migrants and protect them from trafficking and forced labour?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said seminars on human rights and diversity had been provided for over 1,600 public servants. Seminars had been held on the Holocaust for members of the Orthodox Church of Greece and on the basic principles of Islam for prison officers. Over 160 integrity advisors had also been trained and certified to support integrity in the public service. The national school of the judiciary provided mandatory training on human rights, gender-based violence and other topics. In 2024, 15 seminars had been planned for judges and 12 for court staff.\\n\\nGreece directly implemented the Convention in domestic law, which was why court decisions did not directly reference the Convention.\\n\\nIf infringements of labour laws were found, labour inspectors could impose administrative sanctions and fines, and file serious cases of non-compliance with the Prosecutor.\\n\\nRefugee children could enrol in reception classes without documentation. Language classes were offered for students after school hours. Educational guides assisted teachers in making refugee students feel welcome and safe.\\n\\nGreece was facing challenges with the arrival of third country nationals seeking to enter Europe through Türkiye. It had accelerated asylum procedures through the digitisation of asylum procedures. Health care insurance and tax identification numbers were provided to asylum seekers, who could access employment and healthcare throughout the State.\\n\\nOne of the main priorities of Greece\\'s migration policy was to improve asylum conditions. Case managers carried out rapid assessments of new arrivals\\' needs. Vulnerable persons were provided with specialised protection. More interpreters were being provided in collaboration with various public and private organizations and civil society. The \"HELIOS\" integration system offered support to refugees to access the labour market, health and education. Another initiative was specifically focused on providing language, vocational and intercultural training to refugees seeking to enter the job market.\\n\\nMigration legislation had been amended to reduce the number of migrants in informal employment. An agreement had been reached with Egypt on the provision of temporary employment to Egyptian citizens in the agricultural sector. An agreement was also reached with Bangladeshi citizens to improve access to formal employment. These agreements reenforced legal pathways to migration.\\n\\nThe average time taken to process asylum applications was now 100 days; formerly processing took years. Greece collaborated with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to develop a new system of naturalisation that was fairer for refugees and stateless persons. Around 55 applications for Greek citizenship had been received; only 16 were still pending, citizenship had been granted for the rest.\\n\\nPolice had circulated guidelines on the protection of the fundamental rights of refugees arriving in the State. No third country national was to be returned until their asylum application had been processed.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said violence and excessive use of force had been reported in asylum centres. Could the delegation comment on this? Mr. Diaby congratulated the State party on efforts to formalise the status of stateless persons. Did the State party intend to ratify the statelessness convention? How was the State party responding to racist incidents in sport?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert asked about the results of the human rights education strategies implemented by the State.\\n\\nFAITH DIKELEDI PANSY TLAKULA, Committee Expert and Follow-Up Rapporteur, said the Committee had previously recommended that the State party provide training to teachers on providing education to migrant children, ensure individual assessment of asylum applications, and protect against refoulement. What efforts had been made to improve migrants\\' access to asylum procedures and education?\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert said that in recent years, there had been a rise in hate speech across the world, including in Greece. What measures were in place to tackle racist hate speech targeting migrants and minorities, and xenophobia?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the State was proud of improvements that had been made in the situation on the State\\'s islands. The Hellenic Coast Guard\\'s practices followed international law. All allegations of pushbacks were appropriately investigated by monitoring bodies. From 2015 to the present, the Coast Guard had rescued over 250,000 persons at sea. From 2013, Coast Guard officers had been trained in basic human rights principles.\\n\\nGreece was stepping up efforts to prevent trafficking in persons through legal and policy instruments. The national action plan on trafficking in persons was being updated to address financial and labour exploitation. The State party had organised seminars and created standards on the financial aspects of these crimes. New forms of exploitation had been added to legislation. Accommodation, medical care and legal counselling were provided to victims of trafficking in persons. A leaflet on human trafficking had been produced in several languages.\\n\\nThe State party was prioritising the ratification of International Labour Organization convention 29 on forced labour. This process was expected to be completed soon. A plan for the prevention of labour exploitation was formulated by the State each year and preventative inspections were carried out twice a year in vulnerable sectors. Employees could file complaints through an online anonymous complaints service, by email or a telephone hotline. The State provided migrant workers with information about their rights.\\n\\nA programme was in place to increase access to medical staff in asylum centres through measures such as the temporary transfer of medical personnel. Around 16,200 refugee students from 70 different countries were enrolled in Greek educational institutions. Case managers trained in the best interests of the child monitored age assessment procedures, which would soon be harmonised across all European Union Member States.\\n\\nGreece had ratified the regional conventions on safety in sport matches and had implemented legislation that prohibited banners at sporting matches with racist or sexist content.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said Greece only formally recognised one minority, Thrace Muslims. Why were other minority groups not recognised as minorities? What data was collected on minorities? How well represented was the Muslim minority in public bodies and in elected roles at national and local levels?\\n\\nWhat outcomes had been achieved by the last national strategy on the inclusion of the Roma and what progress had been made in implementing the current strategy? Were the Roma consulted about policies and strategies that affected them? Roma people reportedly continued to be victims of discrimination in Greece when trying to access healthcare, housing and employment. Many Roma people lived below the poverty threshold and struggled to access basic services. What measures were in place to ensure equal access for Roma children to education and schooling? What measures were in place to improve access to paid employment and quality healthcare for the Roma? Roma often lacked access to heating, running water and toilets. How was the State party preventing forced evictions and fines for illegal construction? Roma people faced long, costly judicial procedures to acquire Greek nationality. How was the State party promoting their access to nationality?\\n\\nThe Committee noted the adoption of several laws and the national strategy in favour of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. However, this community continued to be subjected to discrimination in schools and public services. What measures were in place to tackle such discrimination? What results had the national strategy achieved?\\n\\nThere were reports of migrant women, including pregnant women, having been assaulted by Greek Coast Guards. Greece had the highest rate of femicide in Europe. What measures were in place to address violence against women?\\n\\nWhat statistics did the State party have on people of African descent and their integration in public life? What activities had been undertaken as part of the International Decade for People of African Descent? How was the State party combatting the multiple forms of discrimination faced by this group? What measures were in place to implement the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action? Was there a formal mechanism in place to assess its implementation?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the term \"minority\" in Greece was understood under stricter criteria than those of the Committee. The State party respected the principle of self-identification. Groups of people who were not recognised as a minority enjoyed all rights under the Convention. Four members of the Hellenic Parliament were Muslims, and more than 100 Muslims had been elected to public bodies.\\n\\nThe Roma had expressed the will not to be considered as an ethnic minority. Authorities paid particular attention to this vulnerable group. The State had made the civil registry process easier and more efficient for the Roma. The previous strategy on Roma inclusion provided specific interventions to address early school dropouts and support access to health and housing. Implementation of this strategy was independently reviewed. There were also 85 local action plans on Roma support elaborated with the Roma population. There was an open, independent consultation platform with 13 Roma organizations that met every three months to devise strategies for Roma inclusion.\\n\\nRoma people were eligible for all State welfare benefits. The State party was promoting the Roma\\'s participation in education and the labour market. The public employment service implemented targeted programmes for the Roma, such as 15,000-euro subsidies for Roma who started a business and training and certification in technical jobs.\\n\\nThe Government had taken measures to facilitate the inclusion of Roma children in education. Psychosocial support was provided to vulnerable students in schools. Roma children could be enrolled in schools without official documentation. Teacher training programmes were provided on combatting early school dropouts and supporting Roma children.\\n\\nThe State party did not have records of complaints against Coast Guard officials regarding sexual assault of pregnant women. This year, there had been 12 victims of femicide. The State party had ratified the Istanbul Convention and was collecting data on violence against women and conducting training in schools to raise awareness of the issue. There was a large network of structures for supporting women victims, who had access to emergency accommodation.\\n\\nThe national strategy on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons aimed to combat discrimination and promote equality for these people. All ministries carried out actions supporting these people.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said there were gaps between policies for the Roma and practices. What was the size of the Roma population? What were the causes of femicides in the State party and the ethnic origins of the victims? Had the State party considered making a law on femicide?\\n\\nA Committee Expert said Roma children were being segregated in Greek schools. How many Roma children were participating in and graduating from inclusive public education?\\n\\nFAITH DIKELEDI PANSY TLAKULA, Committee Expert and Follow-Up Rapporteur, said the Committee had previously expressed concern about the poor working conditions of migrant workers in the agricultural sector and the informal economy. What investigations had been carried out into the exploitation of migrant workers and what compensation was provided to victims? Were employers who imposed abusive labour conditions subjected to criminal sanctions? What training was provided to labour inspectors on identifying victims of human trafficking?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said Greece\\'s efforts to preserve its historical monuments were commendable.\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece was home to a vibrant community of people of African descent, many of whom held leading roles in civil society and public organizations. Greece fully supported the pending General Assembly resolution to declare a second International Decade for People of African DescentOpens in new window. The National Council against Racism and Intolerance was implementing measures to support the rights of people of African descent.\\n\\nThere were 120,000 Roma people in Greece, 20,000 of whom received guaranteed minimum income support. To encourage school attendance, families whose children did not attend school did not receive welfare benefits. Investments had been made to improve housing infrastructure in Roma communities.\\n\\nAround 1,600 labour inspections were carried out this year and fines were issued in around 700 cases. Twenty cases had been reported to the Public Prosecutor regarding potential victims of trafficking in persons. Standards had been developed for seasonal housing for migrant workers. The labour inspectorate\\'s staff had been increased recently. All inspectors participated in training on preventing and identifying human trafficking.\\n\\nClosing Remarks\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, thanked the delegation for the dialogue, which had been intensive, fruitful, frank and necessary. The questions raised by the Committee aimed to assess progress in the implementation of the Convention to help the Committee to develop recommendations that were helpful to Greece.\\n\\nIOANNIS GHIKAS, Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said the dialogue had been intense but constructive, identifying issues that the State party needed to address. Greece was proud of the Greek Committee Expert Stamatia Stavrinaki, who was an excellent representative of the tradition of human rights scholarship in Greece. The strong representation of women in the delegation was a representation of the reality in Greece, where promoting women\\'s representation was a high priority.

Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC) recently held in Cascais, Portugal, Additional Foreign Secretary, Imran Ahmed Siddiqui, reaffirmed Pakistan\\'s \"unwavering commitment\" to combating this scourage, according to a press release issued in NewYork on Tuesday.\\n\\nAt the same time, he reiterated Pakistan\\'s deep concern over the continued rise of Islamophobia, as manifested in the continued desecration of religious symbols, demolition of mosques and other Islamic religious and heritage sites, hate speech and disturbing attacks on Muslims, \"particularly in the territories under foreign occupation\".\\n\\nThe UN Alliance of Civilizations was established in 2005 to galvanize international action against extremism through fostering of international, intercultural and interreligious dialogue and cooperation.\\n\\nThe Alliance benefits from a political support of the Group of Friends, a community of countries and international organizations which actively promotes its objectives and work at the global, regional and local levels, as well as worldwide. The Group is a driving force of UNAOC and plays a vital role in its strategic planning and implementation process.\\n\\nThe group currently includes 153 members, with 124 UN member states, 1 non-member state, and 28 international organizations, representing all continents, societies and cultures.\\n\\nIn his remarks, Imran Siddiqui said commended the Alliance\\'s contributions over the past two decades in fostering dialogue and mutual respect among religions.\\n\\nAs regards Islamophobia, he cited Pakistan\\'s leadership in tabling two General Assembly resolutions on behalf of the OIC on the subject, with the most recent resolution, adopted in March 2024, calling for the appointment of a UN Special Envoy on Islamophobia.\\n\\nA Global Conference on safeguarding religious sites was also held on the margins of the Forum, where Pakistan highlighted the alarming trend of deliberate attacks on mosques, often carried out with impunity and state sanction, the press release said. In this regard, Pakistan urged the UNAOC to prioritize the protection of mosques and other Islamic religious and heritage sites that are at immediate risk of destruction in the mapping of religious sites under the 2019 Action Plan for safeguarding of the religious site.\\n\\nMeanwhile, world leaders attending the forum adopted a bold, forward-looking declaration to advance peace as war rages on, from Gaza and Lebanon to Sudan and Ukraine.\\n\\nHarnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and combatting hate speech and mis- and disinformation are part of the plan to bolster peace and mutual understanding as Heads of State and Government, including kings, presidents and prime ministers from Cabo Verde, Senegal and Spain, unanimously adopted the Cascais Declaration.\\n\\nNamed for the city hosting the UN Alliance for Civilizations 10th Global Forum from 25 to 27 November, the declaration outlines a range of actions and focuses on solutions to a current landscape of eroding trust and rising antisemitism, nationalism and online hate.\\n\\n\"These are very difficult times,\" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the forum\\'s opening session. \"In such a scenario, we need peace\" now, in Gaza, Lebanon, Sudan and Ukraine and beyond.\\n\\nThe adoption of the declaration is the centre-piece of the 10th Global Forum, which included a dynamic youth forum and film festival on Monday, its Intercultural Innovation Hub ceremony on Tuesday and vibrant panels throughout, tackling current challenges, from a spike in antisemitism to the power of young people.\\n\\n\"We need voices and actions across all levels,\" including in communities, online and across cultures and institutions, using all tools available, Guterres said.\\n\\nThe 25-paragraph declaration spotlighted a set of innovative actions and keys to unleashing this badly needed peace. It noted the potential use of AI as a tool to advance intercultural and inter-religious dialogue and stressed the importance of combatting disinformation, misinformation and hate speech while strengthening information integrity.\\n\\nThe Cascais Declaration also stressed the importance of intergenerational dialogue for peace, sustainable development and human rights; noted the contribution of \"sports diplomacy\" as a tool for promoting dialogue and emphasized the need to support and strengthen the role of women as negotiators, mediators and peacemakers.\\n\\nBy its provisions, world leaders and partners pledged to:\\n\\n-- Emphasise the need to combat all forms of religious intolerance;\\n\\n-- Acknowledge the central role of inclusive, quality and transformative education in promoting dialogue, peace and human rights;\\n\\n-- Recognise the role that religious leaders can play in conflict mediation and development cooperation;\\n\\n-- Underline the positive impact that safe, orderly and regular migration can have on countries of origin and destination, including through promoting cultural pluralism and encourage the creative vision of young people to prevent xenophobia and highlight positive narratives about cultural diversity, social inclusion and mobility, and,\\n\\n-- Take note of the adoption of the Pact for the Future, which recognizes the role of reinvigorated multilateralism and the importance of the voice of religious leaders and faith-based organizations in promoting a culture of peace\\n\\nAhead of the declaration\\'s adoption, the UN chief and world leaders took the floor, including Prime Minister Aminata Touré of Senegal, who drew attention to the ongoing devastating war in Gaza.\\n\\n\"As we witness what is happening in Gaza, with more than 42,000 victims, mostly civilians, what does civilization mean in such context?\" she asked. \"Is civilization about \\'you kill one of mine, I\\'ll kill 34.16 of yours,\\' which is, so far, the retaliation rate of Israel against the unacceptable, widely condemned attacks of October 2023. Don\\'t the unbearable scenes we see on television make any discussion on civilization look out of touch?\"\\n\\nShe said there is no other way to deal with civilization than discussion based on equal rights embedded in the UN Charter and international framework.\\n\\nKing Don Felipe VI of Spain told delegates that \"in the 21st century, diplomacy is a tool of peace, but its traditional tools are outdated and must be supplemented with new spheres of action, more boldness, creativity and pragmatism.\"\\n\\n\"We must raise our vision to more deeply understand what unites us,\" King Don Felipe VI said. \"The Alliance of Civilizations is the implementation of what is known as the diplomacy of values, tearing down walls and building bridges,\" he added. \"Our actions must go beyond conference rooms, to school, places where people gather and the marketplace.\"\\n\\nIn this regard, he said, social media is potential as a catalyst in this regard, he said, pointing to the Alliance\\'s Youth Solidarity Fund, which was featured on day one of the 10th Global Forum.\\n\\nStill, a great deal more needs to be done, he said. At a time when dehumanisation is a growing problem, he emphasised that efforts must aim at eliminating stereotypes and ensuring that the wealth of human diversity is beneficial for everyone.\\n\\nIn a similar vein, UN Secretary-General Guterres said that the absence of peace is leading to an erosion of trust, making the Alliance of Civilizations\\'s work more important than ever before.\\n\\n\"Rebuilding trust is our essential task,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Hate-filled frenzies are perpetuating stereotypes and misconceptions,\" the UN chief said. Unchecked digital platforms and AI have endowed hate speech with a speed and reach unseen before. We must rein in hate speech and disinformation spreading online.\"\\n\\nThe Alliance\\'s High Representative Miguel Ángel Moratinos renewed a call for an alliance for peace to put an end to violence and extremism and wars in the 21st century.\\n\\n\"Biodiversity needs to be protected, but what about human diversity?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"We need to make peace with nature, and we need to make peace with ourselves,\" he said, emphasizing that the Alliance is the best platform to do so.'}\n",

At the conference, Emilie Kao, the group\\'s senior counsel and vice president of advocacy strategy, took the floor to express her outrage that a Finnish doctor was put on trial for referring to homosexuality as \"a developmental disorder,\" \"a shame and a sin\" and as a form of \"genetic degeneration.\"\\n\\n\"Thank God she was unanimously acquitted,\" said Kao.\\n\\nAustin Ruse, president of the Center for Family and Human Rights (otherwise known as C-Fam), who has supported laws that would criminalise homosexual behaviour and has also said that hard left people that run modern universities should be \"taken out and shot,\" spoke about some of his group\\'s recent accomplishments. \"There is no redefinition of the family because we stopped them. Sexual orientation and gender identity has never become a category of nondiscrimination in international law, because we have stopped them,\" he said.\\n\\nKao, C-Fam and ADF did not respond to requests for comment. Ruse disputed that he called for the criminalization of gay sex, saying that he was only offering \"a hypothetical.\" He added that he has \"never advocated that anyone be taken out and shot.\"\\n\\nThe access and influence of these anti-LGBTQIA+ groups inside the UN isn\\'t limited to this summit. Both hold what\\'s known as Special Consultative status at the UN. And they\\'re not the only ones.\\n\\nIn a months-long investigation, Uncloseted Media found that at least six Southern Poverty Law Center-designated anti-LGBTQIA+ hate groups hold this coveted status, which is granted by the UN\\'s Economic and Social Council.\\n\\n\"What\\'s astounding is I\\'m not sure anybody\\'s ever produced a list,\" says Heidi Beirich, who oversaw SPLC\\'s annual designation of hate groups from 2012 to 2019. \"These organisations have been stealthily inserting themselves into bodies whose beliefs they don\\'t share for years,\" she says.\\n\\n\"Many of these organisations don\\'t even believe in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\" she says.\\n\\nSpecial Consultative Status -- which is held by more than 5000 groups -- gives members unique access to the UN and its subsidiary bodies, to the various human rights mechanisms of the organisation and to special events organised by the President of the General Assembly.\\n\\nThe UN did not respond to repeated interview requests as well as requests for comment.\\n\\n\"You have access to member states, right? So I think the danger of all of this is access to the members who make decisions on resolutions. Who make UN policy,\" says Gillian Kane, director of global policy and research at Ipas, a non-governmental organisation that focuses on advancing gender equity and reducing the harm of U.S. foreign policy.\\n\\nKane, who attended the November Summit, says this status \"legitimises these groups\" who have clear track records that conflict with the core principles of the UN, like the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing subtle about what they do. They hate gays and they\\'re unapologetic to go after it,\" says Kane.\\n\\nMany of these groups have been around for decades, advocating against the LGBTQIA+ community. Kao\\'s group, ADF, published a press release titled \"ADF increases global impact with new status at United Nations\" when they were granted consultative status in 2010. \"ADF can now have a say when UN treaties and conventions are drafted that directly impact religious liberty and important matters related to the sanctity of life, marriage, and the family,\" the release said. It goes on to say that \"ADF will now be able to monitor and provide input on matters\" affecting religious freedoms.\\n\\nThe group, which consists of hundreds of lawyers in the U.S. and around the globe, was founded in 1994 by Alan Sears, who co-authored The Homosexual Agenda: Exposing the Principal Threat to Religious Freedom Today. Since then, they have advocated at the state and federal level for laws that promote conversion therapy and that would ban gays from serving in the military. In addition, they\\'ve testified in favour of laws that would strip transgender folks of the right to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity, that would prevent them from changing the name on their birth certificate and that would ban their access to gender affirming healthcare.\\n\\nIn addition, they have been effective globally through their international arm, ADF International. In 2012 in Jamaica, they advocated for the retention of a a law that criminalises gay sex. That law remains in effect. And in 2013, members of ADF worked to defend a Belize statute that makes anyone engaging in LGBTQIA+ sex subject to a punishment of up to 10 years in prison.\\n\\nThe other groups -- which include the Howard Center for Family Religion and Society (now known as International Organization for Family), Family Research Council, the Association of United Families International and the American Family Association of New York -- all have similar track records.\\n\\nSubscribe now\\n\\nFamily Research Council has advocated in favor of conversion therapy laws and continues to publish articles that falsely assert that \"sexual orientation change efforts\" are effective for gay people. And Tim Wildmon, the President of the American Family Association, is currently advocating for a boycott of Target for allowing trans people to use the bathroom or dressing room that matches their gender identity.\\n\\n\"Please use #BoycottTarget,\" Wildmon wrote in a special update on their website.\\n\\nBecause of these track records, Beirich felt it was \"a no brainer\" to add them to the SPLC\\'s list of hate groups alongside the Ku Klux Klan, the American Defense Skinheads and Aryan Nations.\\n\\n\"We put them on the hate list because they demonise the entire LGBTQIA+ population in derogatory, dehumanising language, just like the Klan would with Black people or Jewish people,\" says Beirich, now the co-founder and chief strategy officer at the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.\\n\\n\"People in the Christian right who have long demonised the LGBTQIA+ community have political power in this country, and it\\'s more normalised to hate queer people than to hate Black people for no damn good reason. Which is what we\\'re talking about. So it\\'s the biblically informed aspect of it that somehow legitimises it,\" says Beirich, who adds that she has \"absolutely no idea\" how these groups secured this status.\\n\\nSo how do these groups get here? While they all conform to basic principles required for Special Consultative Status, such as being a registered nonprofit and having specialised expertise on issues relevant to the UN, they are also expected to act in conformity with \"the spirit, purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,\" which specifically states that members must promote and encourage respect for human rights, take action \"to strengthen universal peace\" and -- specifically for members with consultative status -- must promote policies that encourage \"social progress.\"\\n\\nNeil Datta, the executive director for the European Parliamentary Forum for Sexual and Reproductive Rights, says part of the reason these groups are granted this status is due to overworked civil servants who work for the NGO Branch of the UN and are in charge of a preliminary screening of these applicants.\\n\\n\"The folks reviewing these applications are not necessarily thematic experts on anything. So they\\'re tasked with a very dry job of processing different applications that come in, and very legitimately won\\'t know what all of these different groups are,\" he says. \"Imagine you had 15 climate groups applying and one didn\\'t believe in climate change. It\\'s not necessarily that easy to understand.\"\\n\\nDatta says it can be even harder to identify anti-LGBTQIA+ groups because they often operate under the guise of protecting the family or the rights of the child.\\n\\n\"These groups have very nice names that aren\\'t obviously anti-LGBTQIA+. And so the people reviewing these applications may not be able to pick up on some of the subtleties,\" he says.\\n\\nIn addition, Datta says these groups use \"very clever vocabulary\" that sounds well meaning. But really, they are weaponising this language to penetrate powerful institutions like the UN \"In reality, they\\'re using religious freedom as a fig leaf for hate speech.\"\\n\\n\"But if you know your Catholic social doctrine, then you will recognise [this vocabulary] immediately.\" Datta says common dog whistles such as \"common good\" or \"human dignity\" and \"in favour of life [or] of the family\" are used almost exclusively to limit the human rights of others, \"usually in sexuality and reproduction.\"\\n\\nDatta says these \"codewords\" are another reason these groups go unnoticed within the UN. For example, during a three hour meeting at the November Transatlantic Summit event, participants used the term \"human dignity\" over 30 times.\\n\\nAfter they get through the preliminary screening by UN civil servants, their application is reviewed by the NGO Committee -- which meets twice a year -- to decide who they will recommend for Special Consultative Status. After review, the recommended organisations are presented to ECOSOC for their final decision.\\n\\nThis committee includes 19 countries, including multiple countries that have extremely hostile policies against LGBTQIA+ people, like Algeria, where homosexual activity is punishable by up to two years in prison; and Eritrea, where homosexuality is illegal and can be punished with jail-time.\\n\\n\"It honestly depends on who\\'s sitting on that committee. So if you have countries that already have anti-LGBTQIA+ policies in place, they\\'re going to be friendly to inviting these groups in and approving their status,\" says Kane.\\n\\nOnce these groups officially gain this status, they use religious freedom as a justification for promoting policies and laws that limit the rights of LGBTQIA+ people through the UN apparatus.\\n\\nThe UN Declaration of Human Rights does not yet explicitly protect folks who are discriminated against for their sexual orientation or gender identity. This lack of protection has given anti-LGBTQIA+ groups leverage in their arguments to roll back the rights of LGBTQIA+ folks.\\n\\nInside the UN, there are efforts to change this. For example, in 2019 the Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect published a Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech that outlines what constitutes hate speech and how to combat it. In it, they describe hate speech \"as any kind of communication in speech, writing or behaviour, that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender or other identity factor.\"\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, this new guidance is opposed by the anti-LGBTQIA+ hate groups. At the Political Network for Values Transatlantic Summit in November, ADF\\'s Kao said current hate speech laws protect too many different groups of people and in doing so infringe on religious freedom laws. \"Who can possibly know what would fall under such an expansive definition of hate?\" she said. \"These laws give a veto to any offended person, allowing them to censor their neighbours.\"\\n\\nBeirich strongly disagrees. \"You can\\'t use religion as a foil for harming communities and tearing into their civil and human rights. I don\\'t care,\" she says, adding that the Ku Klux Klan has weaponised religion as a means to discriminate against Black people since it was founded in 1865.\\n\\n\"It\\'s one thing to live your life however you want to live it biblically inspired. It\\'s a different thing to have that affect other people,\" says Beirich. \"Keep your views to yourself.\"\\n\\nAs these groups continue to operate inside the UN, what can be done? Datta says NGOs applying for Special Consultative Status should be subject to more rigorous background checks, where an independent body thoroughly examines the track record of applicants.\\n\\n\"What are the positions...of these organisations and what have they actually done?\" says Datta. \"What other things have they done which could be seen as having undermined human rights -- the UN\\'s Declaration of Human Rights?\"\\n\\nHe says using an independent body for this review would reduce the potential of political influences in the decision-making process.\\n\\nAs for those who already have Special Consultative Status, their status can be revoked if they don\\'t \"conform at all times to the principles governing the establishment.\"\\n\\nBeirich feels strongly that should happen swiftly for all six anti-LGBTQIA+ groups that currently hold this status. \"The United Nations should revoke the consultative status of people who stand opposed to the Universal Declaration. It shouldn\\'t stand for policies that are rolling back human rights -- it\\'s absurd.\"'}\n",

Were victims of hate crimes made aware of this guide?\\n\\nBakri Sidiki Diaby, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said there had been several allegations of excessive use of force against minorities by the police. How was the State party ensuring that all allegations were properly investigated, perpetrators punished, and victims granted reparations?\\n\\nMr. Diaby said that since March 2020, a significant deterioration had been noted in the security of persons from third countries seeking asylum in the east of Greece. There had been reports of summary forced return, secret detention, confiscation of personal effects, and intrusive searches. What steps had been taken to investigate these alleged violations of human rights and to prevent such violations?\\n\\nIntroducing the report, Aikaterini Patsogianni, Secretary General of Equality and Human Rights, Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family Affairs of Greece and head of the delegation, said that, in the fight against racism, police authorities had developed standards and guidance in areas such as training and capacity building of law enforcement, improved recording and collection of data on hate crimes, as well as cooperation between law enforcement and civil society organizations, and ways to address underreporting.\\n\\nThe delegation said one key initiative of the national action plan against racism and intolerance was the guide for victims on reporting hate crimes, which had been translated into nine languages and published online. Several training activities had been held to improve State authorities\\' response to hate crimes.\\n\\nPolice personnel were obliged to respect human rights and perform their duties based on respect for individuals, the delegation said. Over 1,000 cases of police misdemeanours had been conveyed to the Ombudsman, and around 660 disciplinary sanctions had been implemented.\\n\\nThe delegation said the Hellenic Coast Guard\\'s practices followed international law. Protecting human life at sea and aiding those in distress, without any form of discrimination, was the highest duty of the Coast Guard. All allegations of pushbacks were appropriately investigated by monitoring bodies. The Coast Guard had saved and continued to save thousands of lives at sea. From 2013, Coast Guard officers had been trained in basic human rights principles.\\n\\nIn concluding remarks, Mr. Diaby thanked the delegation for the dialogue, which had been intensive, fruitful, frank and necessary. The questions raised by the Committee aimed to assess progress in the implementation of the Convention to help the Committee to develop recommendations that were helpful to Greece.\\n\\nIn his concluding remarks, Ioannis Ghikas, Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said the dialogue had been intense but constructive, identifying issues that the State party needed to address. The State was proud of the progress it had made since the last review, including in protecting the rights of asylum seekers and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons.\\n\\nThe delegation of Greece consisted of representatives of the Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family Affairs; Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Ministry of Interior; Ministry of Education, Religious Affairs and Sports; Ministry of Health; Ministry of Citizen Protection; Ministry of Labour and Social Security; Ministry of Justice; Ministry of Migration and Asylum; Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Insular Policy; Hellenic Labour Inspectorate; Presidency of the Government; and the Permanent Mission of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva.\\n\\nThe Committee will issue its concluding observations on the report of Greece after the conclusion of its one hundred and fourteenthOpens in new window session on 13 December.

The State party had taken significant initiatives to combat racial discrimination, including by implementing the national action plan on preventing racism and intolerance, laws combatting hate speech, and training programmes for law enforcement officials. The State party had also adopted a national action plan on preventing anti-Semitism and had made efforts to promote the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, including by implementing legislation on same-sex marriage.\\n\\nProgress had been made despite the decade-long economic crisis that Greece had been facing. The racist \"Golden Dawn\" organization had been banned from participating in political activities and its leaders had been imprisoned. Civil society continued to support the State party\\'s efforts to prevent racism and intolerance. There was much work to be done, but Greece was committed to addressing the issues it faced, and looked forward to the recommendations of the Committee.\\n\\nAIKATERINI PATSOGIANNI, Secretary General of Equality and Human Rights, Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family Affairs of Greece and head of the delegation, said that since the last review, Greece had been advancing toward long-term sustainable economic progress, supporting its human rights and anti-racism framework. In the fight against racism, police authorities had developed standards and guidance in areas such as training and capacity building of law enforcement, improved recording and collection of data on hate crimes, as well as cooperation between law enforcement and civil society organizations, and ways to address underreporting. The judicial system responded to organizations that exploited the economic crisis and the resulting fractures to the social fabric to commit criminal racist acts, while the legislature took measures to protect and safeguard the democratic electoral process from such criminal organizations.\\n\\nThe National Council against Racism and Intolerance, in which independent bodies also participated, adopted its first national action plan in December 2020. Efforts for the second action plan were underway, with funding secured for a results-driven agenda. In this regard, the State party was ready to work with relevant stakeholders, including the Racist Violence Recording Network.\\n\\nGreece was actively implementing the National Strategy on the Roma 2021-2030, guided by the principle of \"for the Roma, with the Roma.\" Key committees, including the independent Roma Forum, were fully operational. All available European Union funding was used to enhance the Roma\\'s employment, education, healthcare and housing.\\n\\nOn migration, modernised reception facilities ensured dignified conditions and targeted care for vulnerable groups, while a robust system supported unaccompanied minors. The Asylum Service had significantly improved in efficiency. The \"HELIOS\" project and legal reforms promoted integration and labour market access. Enhanced international cooperation also provided pathways for organised, legal migration.\\n\\nBorder protection was carried out in line with domestic, European and international law. Protecting human life at sea and aiding those in distress, without any form of discrimination, was the highest duty of the Hellenic Coast Guard. Allegations of violations of the principle of non-refoulement were inconsistent with the operational activities of the competent agencies. The State had put in place a multi-level policy for the effective monitoring of fundamental rights. The Hellenic Coast Guard had saved and continued to save thousands of lives at sea.\\n\\nGreece had ratified International Labour Organization Convention 190 to create a work environment free from violence and harassment. Public authorities detected and protected all trafficking victims, without discrimination, in line with the principles of the Office of the National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings and the National Referral Mechanism.\\n\\nInclusive education was promoted through various initiatives and teacher training programmes. Key efforts included the \"Active Citizens\\' Actions\" curriculum supporting the Sustainable Development Goals, a 2023 anti-bullying law with a reporting platform, a mobile phone ban to reduce cyberbullying, and the introduction of \"Digital School\" and \"Skills Lab\" to enhance digital learning.\\n\\nThe State party had also established an independent Committee of Deontology, aimed at countering all types of expression in printed and electronic media that incited, promoted, spread or justified violence, hatred or discriminatory speech. Human rights education, training and awareness-raising activities, including for law enforcement personnel and members of the judiciary, remained top priorities.\\n\\nQuestions by a Committee Expert\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, thanked Greece for supporting the candidacy of Greek Expert Stamatia Stavrinaki to the Committee, who made remarkable contributions to its work.\\n\\nCould the delegation provide information on the ethnic makeup of the population and of asylum seekers and refugees living in the State party? The Committee was concerned by the general lack of disaggregated data on racial discrimination. What measures were in place to implement a comprehensive data collection system?\\n\\nWhat measures had the State party taken to address excessive use of force by the police? There had been several allegations of such excessive use of force against minorities. How was the State party ensuring that all allegations were properly investigated, perpetrators punished, and victims granted reparations?\\n\\nThere was a limited number of convictions for cases involving racial discrimination and official data on cases reported to the police was not accessible to the public. The Committee was concerned that the new anti-racist law was not fully in line with the requirements of article four of the Convention as it did not criminalise the dissemination of ideas of racial superiority or prohibit racist organizations. What measures were in place to revise legislation to ensure that all incitement to racial, ethnic and religious hatred was criminalised and that perpetrators were punished? How had the police\\'s capacity to investigate racist crimes and to combat racist violence been increased? State services reportedly did not provide appropriate, timely support to victims of racist violence, who relied on support from civil society. Was a referral system for victims to State services being developed?\\n\\nOver the reporting period, there had been 89 reported cases of racism targeting asylum seekers and refugees. The Committee welcomed the various legislative measures undertaken to address racism. Were there gaps in the implementation of legislation on racism? Was there a media regulatory body that held journalists to account when they disseminated racist notions?\\n\\nWas the State party drafting a new national action plan to combat racism and intolerance? What results had the last action plan achieved? The National Council against Racism and Intolerance had been reactivated in 2024. What measures were in place to ensure that the Council could work effectively?\\n\\nWhy had there been delays in the registration of civil society organizations claiming to have minority status? Some minority associations had been dissolved; could the delegation comment on this?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece did not collect statistical data based on race and religious affiliations due to its protection of the right to privacy. Statistical data was collected on specific categories of beneficiaries of State policies, such as policies for the Roma. Data was also collected on the demographics of prison inmates, and on migrants, asylum seekers and refugees according to European Union regulations. A unified information system for reception and asylum was being developed. Data on migrants\\' gender, ethnicity and religion was collected.\\n\\nAfter 2015, there was an amendment to legislation concerning the punishment of hate crimes that facilitated the investigation and prosecution of cases by eliminating the need to prove the standard of \"hate\". Data from the judiciary and the Public Prosecutor showed that there had been better implementation of hate crime legislation in recent years. The State party also had legislation on hate speech and incitement to hatred that addressed speech inciting racial superiority.\\n\\n\"Golden Dawn\" was not allowed to participate in elections and State funding to it had been suspended. All political parties that acted as proxies for persons who had committed racist hate crimes were prohibited, and on this basis two political parties had recently been banned from participating in elections.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said human rights defenders were sometimes accused and condemned without having the opportunity to defend themselves. Did the State party intend to adopt special legislation to protect human rights defenders? Several dozens of cases of refoulement involving Greece had been examined by the European Court of Human Rights. Were border police trained on the handling of migrants? What aid had been provided to victims of police violence?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said that although the European Union directive on victim support had been incorporated into national legislation, there were allegations that the directive was not sufficiently applied, leading to impunity for perpetrators of racist acts. How did the State party collect data on foreign nationals in the prison system? What recommendations had been provided by the Racist Violence Reporting Network to the State and had these been implemented?\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert asked about the effectiveness of State policies. How many of the cases of police misconduct reported had resulted in sanctions? How many committees reviewing journalistic ethics had members of racial minority groups?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece had permitted the reopening of domestic court proceedings after decisions on three cases by the European Court of Human Rights. A committee of independent experts had been established to develop strategies for the implementation of the European Court\\'s decisions.\\n\\nPolice personnel were obliged to respect human rights and perform their duties based on respect for individuals. They needed to avoid prejudice based on distinguishing characteristics. The Hellenic Police transmitted relevant information to an independent Ombudsman concerning cases involving discrimination. Over 1,000 cases of police misdemeanours had been conveyed to the Ombudsman, and around 660 disciplinary sanctions had been implemented. Several cases related to racist actions by the police.\\n\\nThe law on audiovisual media services prohibited the dissemination of hate speech based on race and other characteristics. The National Media Advisory Authority had the competence to impose sanctions for disseminating hate speech through online and offline media. All print and online media needed to meet requirements related to the Journalistic Code of Ethics, which included prohibitions of hate speech. The Journalistic Ethics Committee was mandated to investigate all allegations of discriminatory speech. Its members were not appointed based on their ethnicity or sex but were journalists and academics.\\n\\nIn Greece, persons with low income could apply for free legal aid. Legal aid was also provided to victims in trafficking cases and to female victims of violence. Measures were in place to protect victims from secondary victimisation in legal proceedings. All victims were informed of their rights, including the right to compensation.\\n\\nThe Greek legislative framework did not have a specific law for the protection of human rights defenders; all persons were equal before the law.\\n\\nPrivate funding of political parties was strictly forbidden in Greece. Only State funding was legal for political parties. This was why State funding had been suspended for parties that engaged in hate crimes and hate speech.\\n\\nQuestions by a Committee Expert\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said not all incidents of racism were reported by victims, allegedly due to a lack of confidence in the authorities. What measures were in place to strengthen confidence in the justice system among citizens? Did the State party intend to establish an efficient data collection system on racist violence? How would it promote access to justice for victims of racial discrimination? How many complaints of racist hate speech and hate crimes had been received by the State and how many perpetrators had been prosecuted? In how many court cases had the Convention been cited? What measures had the State party taken to encourage the participation of civil society in the implementation of the Convention? Racism continued to be prevalent in the Attica region and in centres where refugees and asylum seekers were located. Did the State party intend to accept the Committee\\'s communications procedure?\\n\\nDiscrimination against minorities by authorities persisted. What recent educational initiatives had been implemented to combat intolerance and prejudice and promote intercultural dialogue? The State party had received the Global Education Award for establishing the Skills Lab, which promoted ethnic tolerance. Was this implemented in all regions of the State party and at all levels?\\n\\nThe Committee commended the State party for its efforts to create memorials of the Holocaust. There were 158 attacks based on religion recorded in 2023. What measures were in place to ensure efficient investigations of these incidents and to develop protection measures? There had also been an increase in cases of vandalism of religious sites and profanation in recent years. What measures were in place to put an end to these practices?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the police code of conduct required police to act with empathy toward vulnerable people. The State party collected data on hate speech and hate crimes, including data on racially motivated crimes.\\n\\nIn Greek prisons, data was collected on nationality. Foreigners from 101 nationalities made up 50 per cent of the prison population. These were persons who were convicted and serving these sentences in Greek prisons. Greece was on the crossroads of many routes, and many people in prisons in Greece were engaged in cross-border criminal activity.\\n\\nThe Ombudsperson received discrimination complaints. Racial discrimination complaints made up seven per cent of complaints received in 2023, up from two per cent in 2022. The labour inspectorate examined complaints of workplace discrimination. The inspectorate was empowered to instigate administrative sanctions. Three cases it investigated in 2023 involved discrimination on the grounds of nationality.\\n\\nThe police had established specialised departments to address violent hate crimes and hate speech and provide support to victims in Attica and the Eastern Aegean region. A hotline and online form for reporting hate crimes had been implemented, and several campaigns were underway on online hate speech. The police force was cooperating with civil society, which provided training to upgrade the capacities of police staff.\\n\\nThe Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure had been revised to make them more victim centred. Courts had been redistributed to improve citizens\\' access across the State. Domestic violence legislation had also been modernised.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, asked for statistics on victims of discrimination who had benefitted from free legal aid. There was a large gap between the records of racist violence of the Racist Violence Reporting NetworkOpens in new window and the Government. Why was this? On what basis was the second national action plan on addressing racism being devised?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said that it was quite shocking that 50 per cent of prisoners in Greece were non-nationals.\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert said that the State\\'s regulations on the provision of legal aid appeared to limit access to it. Would it consider implementing a system of reviewing all requests for legal aid, regardless of the type of crime?\\n\\nA Committee Expert asked whether the labour inspectorate assigned fines for workplace discrimination. Why were non-nationals in Attica most impacted by racist crimes? How did the State party apply the recommendations of the Racist Violence Reporting Network? The Expert welcomed the guide on reporting hate crimes. Were victims made aware of this guide?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the national action plan against racism and intolerance focused on addressing hate crimes, empowering minorities, and eliminating discrimination based on various characteristics. One key initiative was the guide for victims on reporting hate crimes, which had been translated into nine languages and distributed to migrant reception centres and published online. Several training activities had been held to improve State authorities\\' response to hate crimes.\\n\\nThe National Council against Racism and Intolerance had held meetings with civil society to develop the second national action plan on addressing racism and intolerance. It had secured funding to improve victims\\' access to State services. The Council would review the Committee\\'s recommendations and include them in the second national action plan, which would focus on strengthening data collection on hate crimes and developing more services for victims.\\n\\nThe Skills Lab initiative had been piloted nationwide. New curricula promoted human rights education and intercultural communication. Training courses were offered for teachers on human rights and inclusion. A digital platform for reporting school bullying and violence had been launched. As of April 2024, over 700 reports had been received, 10 per cent of which related to racism.\\n\\nVarious actions had been taken to provide education about the Holocaust. Greece was one of the first countries to return the property of victims of the Holocaust. The State collected data on vandalism of religious sites. In 2015, 147 cases were recorded.\\n\\nThe procedure for applying for free legal aid was very simple. Applicants needed only to supply documents proving that they had low income. Victims of almost all crimes could apply for this aid. Lawyers could be appointed for defendants in serious crimes with punishments of five years imprisonment or more.\\n\\nOn some occasions, victims of racist violence went to the Racist Violence Reporting Network but not to public authorities. In 2023, 115 cases had been opened by authorities. There was not a big gap between the number of cases collected by authorities and by the Network. More than half of the population lived in Attica. This was why most racist crimes were reported in this region.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said 18 per cent of asylum camp residents did not enjoy basic material conditions, including food and financial assistance. There were only 29 doctors, 92 nurses and 69 interpreters deployed across all the camps, some of which had more than 1,000 residents. What measures were in place to improve the situation in the camps and ensure that the detention of foreign nationals was only done as a last resort? How was the State party ensuring access to interpretation services for foreign nationals? What efforts had been made to develop a statelessness establishment procedure? How was the State party addressing barriers to refugees accessing official documents?\\n\\nWhat steps had been taken to investigate alleged violations of human rights in the context of border management and to prevent such violations? Was there regular independent surveillance of border forces and efforts to strengthen their capacity? Since March 2020, a significant deterioration had been noted in the security and safety of persons from third countries seeking asylum in the east of Greece. There had been reports of summary forced return of persons who had entered from Türkiye, secret detention without sufficient safeguards, confiscation of personal effects, and intrusive searches. There were also reports of private individuals towing and removing engines from asylum seekers\\' boats, and assisting officials in carrying out forced returns.\\n\\nGreece had not signed the statelessness convention and the Presidential decree on the statelessness determination procedure had not been promulgated. Around 3,740 people in Greece had stated that they had no nationality. What measures would the State party take to better address the issue of statelessness?\\n\\nThe Committee had previously expressed concern regarding low salaries and long working hours for migrant workers, particularly in the agricultural sector. What measures were in place to improve the situation of migrant workers? Was there a safe and accessible way of filing complaints related to workplace discrimination? What measures were in place to support undocumented migrants and protect them from trafficking and forced labour?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said seminars on human rights and diversity had been provided for over 1,600 public servants. Seminars had been held on the Holocaust for members of the Orthodox Church of Greece and on the basic principles of Islam for prison officers. Over 160 integrity advisors had also been trained and certified to support integrity in the public service. The national school of the judiciary provided mandatory training on human rights, gender-based violence and other topics. In 2024, 15 seminars had been planned for judges and 12 for court staff.\\n\\nGreece directly implemented the Convention in domestic law, which was why court decisions did not directly reference the Convention.\\n\\nIf infringements of labour laws were found, labour inspectors could impose administrative sanctions and fines, and file serious cases of non-compliance with the Prosecutor.\\n\\nRefugee children could enrol in reception classes without documentation. Language classes were offered for students after school hours. Educational guides assisted teachers in making refugee students feel welcome and safe.\\n\\nGreece was facing challenges with the arrival of third country nationals seeking to enter Europe through Türkiye. It had accelerated asylum procedures through the digitisation of asylum procedures. Health care insurance and tax identification numbers were provided to asylum seekers, who could access employment and healthcare throughout the State.\\n\\nOne of the main priorities of Greece\\'s migration policy was to improve asylum conditions. Case managers carried out rapid assessments of new arrivals\\' needs. Vulnerable persons were provided with specialised protection. More interpreters were being provided in collaboration with various public and private organizations and civil society. The \"HELIOS\" integration system offered support to refugees to access the labour market, health and education. Another initiative was specifically focused on providing language, vocational and intercultural training to refugees seeking to enter the job market.\\n\\nMigration legislation had been amended to reduce the number of migrants in informal employment. An agreement had been reached with Egypt on the provision of temporary employment to Egyptian citizens in the agricultural sector. An agreement was also reached with Bangladeshi citizens to improve access to formal employment. These agreements reenforced legal pathways to migration.\\n\\nThe average time taken to process asylum applications was now 100 days; formerly processing took years. Greece collaborated with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to develop a new system of naturalisation that was fairer for refugees and stateless persons. Around 55 applications for Greek citizenship had been received; only 16 were still pending, citizenship had been granted for the rest.\\n\\nPolice had circulated guidelines on the protection of the fundamental rights of refugees arriving in the State. No third country national was to be returned until their asylum application had been processed.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said violence and excessive use of force had been reported in asylum centres. Could the delegation comment on this? Mr. Diaby congratulated the State party on efforts to formalise the status of stateless persons. Did the State party intend to ratify the statelessness convention? How was the State party responding to racist incidents in sport?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert asked about the results of the human rights education strategies implemented by the State.\\n\\nFAITH DIKELEDI PANSY TLAKULA, Committee Expert and Follow-Up Rapporteur, said the Committee had previously recommended that the State party provide training to teachers on providing education to migrant children, ensure individual assessment of asylum applications, and protect against refoulement. What efforts had been made to improve migrants\\' access to asylum procedures and education?\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert said that in recent years, there had been a rise in hate speech across the world, including in Greece. What measures were in place to tackle racist hate speech targeting migrants and minorities, and xenophobia?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the State was proud of improvements that had been made in the situation on the State\\'s islands. The Hellenic Coast Guard\\'s practices followed international law. All allegations of pushbacks were appropriately investigated by monitoring bodies. From 2015 to the present, the Coast Guard had rescued over 250,000 persons at sea. From 2013, Coast Guard officers had been trained in basic human rights principles.\\n\\nGreece was stepping up efforts to prevent trafficking in persons through legal and policy instruments. The national action plan on trafficking in persons was being updated to address financial and labour exploitation. The State party had organised seminars and created standards on the financial aspects of these crimes. New forms of exploitation had been added to legislation. Accommodation, medical care and legal counselling were provided to victims of trafficking in persons. A leaflet on human trafficking had been produced in several languages.\\n\\nThe State party was prioritising the ratification of International Labour Organization convention 29 on forced labour. This process was expected to be completed soon. A plan for the prevention of labour exploitation was formulated by the State each year and preventative inspections were carried out twice a year in vulnerable sectors. Employees could file complaints through an online anonymous complaints service, by email or a telephone hotline. The State provided migrant workers with information about their rights.\\n\\nA programme was in place to increase access to medical staff in asylum centres through measures such as the temporary transfer of medical personnel. Around 16,200 refugee students from 70 different countries were enrolled in Greek educational institutions. Case managers trained in the best interests of the child monitored age assessment procedures, which would soon be harmonised across all European Union Member States.\\n\\nGreece had ratified the regional conventions on safety in sport matches and had implemented legislation that prohibited banners at sporting matches with racist or sexist content.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said Greece only formally recognised one minority, Thrace Muslims. Why were other minority groups not recognised as minorities? What data was collected on minorities? How well represented was the Muslim minority in public bodies and in elected roles at national and local levels?\\n\\nWhat outcomes had been achieved by the last national strategy on the inclusion of the Roma and what progress had been made in implementing the current strategy? Were the Roma consulted about policies and strategies that affected them? Roma people reportedly continued to be victims of discrimination in Greece when trying to access healthcare, housing and employment. Many Roma people lived below the poverty threshold and struggled to access basic services. What measures were in place to ensure equal access for Roma children to education and schooling? What measures were in place to improve access to paid employment and quality healthcare for the Roma? Roma often lacked access to heating, running water and toilets. How was the State party preventing forced evictions and fines for illegal construction? Roma people faced long, costly judicial procedures to acquire Greek nationality. How was the State party promoting their access to nationality?\\n\\nThe Committee noted the adoption of several laws and the national strategy in favour of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. However, this community continued to be subjected to discrimination in schools and public services. What measures were in place to tackle such discrimination? What results had the national strategy achieved?\\n\\nThere were reports of migrant women, including pregnant women, having been assaulted by Greek Coast Guards. Greece had the highest rate of femicide in Europe. What measures were in place to address violence against women?\\n\\nWhat statistics did the State party have on people of African descent and their integration in public life? What activities had been undertaken as part of the International Decade for People of African Descent? How was the State party combatting the multiple forms of discrimination faced by this group? What measures were in place to implement the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action? Was there a formal mechanism in place to assess its implementation?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the term \"minority\" in Greece was understood under stricter criteria than those of the Committee. The State party respected the principle of self-identification. Groups of people who were not recognised as a minority enjoyed all rights under the Convention. Four members of the Hellenic Parliament were Muslims, and more than 100 Muslims had been elected to public bodies.\\n\\nThe Roma had expressed the will not to be considered as an ethnic minority. Authorities paid particular attention to this vulnerable group. The State had made the civil registry process easier and more efficient for the Roma. The previous strategy on Roma inclusion provided specific interventions to address early school dropouts and support access to health and housing. Implementation of this strategy was independently reviewed. There were also 85 local action plans on Roma support elaborated with the Roma population. There was an open, independent consultation platform with 13 Roma organizations that met every three months to devise strategies for Roma inclusion.\\n\\nRoma people were eligible for all State welfare benefits. The State party was promoting the Roma\\'s participation in education and the labour market. The public employment service implemented targeted programmes for the Roma, such as 15,000-euro subsidies for Roma who started a business and training and certification in technical jobs.\\n\\nThe Government had taken measures to facilitate the inclusion of Roma children in education. Psychosocial support was provided to vulnerable students in schools. Roma children could be enrolled in schools without official documentation. Teacher training programmes were provided on combatting early school dropouts and supporting Roma children.\\n\\nThe State party did not have records of complaints against Coast Guard officials regarding sexual assault of pregnant women. This year, there had been 12 victims of femicide. The State party had ratified the Istanbul Convention and was collecting data on violence against women and conducting training in schools to raise awareness of the issue. There was a large network of structures for supporting women victims, who had access to emergency accommodation.\\n\\nThe national strategy on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons aimed to combat discrimination and promote equality for these people. All ministries carried out actions supporting these people.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said there were gaps between policies for the Roma and practices. What was the size of the Roma population? What were the causes of femicides in the State party and the ethnic origins of the victims? Had the State party considered making a law on femicide?\\n\\nA Committee Expert said Roma children were being segregated in Greek schools. How many Roma children were participating in and graduating from inclusive public education?\\n\\nFAITH DIKELEDI PANSY TLAKULA, Committee Expert and Follow-Up Rapporteur, said the Committee had previously expressed concern about the poor working conditions of migrant workers in the agricultural sector and the informal economy. What investigations had been carried out into the exploitation of migrant workers and what compensation was provided to victims? Were employers who imposed abusive labour conditions subjected to criminal sanctions? What training was provided to labour inspectors on identifying victims of human trafficking?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said Greece\\'s efforts to preserve its historical monuments were commendable.\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece was home to a vibrant community of people of African descent, many of whom held leading roles in civil society and public organizations. Greece fully supported the pending General Assembly resolution to declare a second International Decade for People of African DescentOpens in new window. The National Council against Racism and Intolerance was implementing measures to support the rights of people of African descent.\\n\\nThere were 120,000 Roma people in Greece, 20,000 of whom received guaranteed minimum income support. To encourage school attendance, families whose children did not attend school did not receive welfare benefits. Investments had been made to improve housing infrastructure in Roma communities.\\n\\nAround 1,600 labour inspections were carried out this year and fines were issued in around 700 cases. Twenty cases had been reported to the Public Prosecutor regarding potential victims of trafficking in persons. Standards had been developed for seasonal housing for migrant workers. The labour inspectorate\\'s staff had been increased recently. All inspectors participated in training on preventing and identifying human trafficking.\\n\\nClosing Remarks\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, thanked the delegation for the dialogue, which had been intensive, fruitful, frank and necessary. The questions raised by the Committee aimed to assess progress in the implementation of the Convention to help the Committee to develop recommendations that were helpful to Greece.\\n\\nIOANNIS GHIKAS, Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said the dialogue had been intense but constructive, identifying issues that the State party needed to address. Greece was proud of the Greek Committee Expert Stamatia Stavrinaki, who was an excellent representative of the tradition of human rights scholarship in Greece. The strong representation of women in the delegation was a representation of the reality in Greece, where promoting women\\'s representation was a high priority. The State was proud of the progress it had made since the last review, including in protecting the rights of asylum seekers and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons.'}\n",

      "filtered article =  {'topic': 'Race Identity', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech and racism', 'title': 'The Systemic Abyss', 'url': 'https://djhzeijoyesu.medium.com/the-systemic-abyss-c339ff2b7d74', 'published_date': '2024-12-06T22:02:51Z', 'source': 'Medium', 'content': 'This paper examines the profound historical, psychological, and social implications of the racial slur \"nigger,\" advocating for its abolition as a symbol of systemic oppression and moral degradation. By contrasting the prohibition of prayer in secular systems with the tolerance of this slur, the paper critiques the inadequacies of current structural frameworks in addressing systemic injustice. It further explores how language shapes societal norms and proposes a framework for rethinking linguistic accountability, with a focus on scientific and sociological research. The paper concludes by recommending legislative, cultural, and educational strategies to eradicate this term, emphasizing its potential to serve as a precedent for combating other forms of hate speech.\\n\\nLanguage is a powerful tool for constructing reality. Words have the ability to heal, inspire, harm, or dehumanize. Few words encapsulate this duality as starkly as the racial slur \"nigger.\" Originating in colonial times as a means of dehumanizing African-descended individuals, this word persists as a vestige of slavery and systemic racism. While the global community recognizes hate speech as a moral and legal offense, this particular term remains paradoxically present in cultural and societal contexts. This paper explores why its abolition is necessary, examining systemic contradictions such as the prohibition of prayer in secular institutions, which reflects inconsistent applications of societal norms.\\n\\nThe word \"nigger\" is not merely a slur; it is a linguistic artifact of oppression. Its use was instrumental in the transatlantic slave trade, serving to justify inhuman treatment and the commodification of Black individuals. Even post-slavery, its usage perpetuated psychological trauma and reinforced systemic segregation. This section will:\\n\\nDiscuss its transition into contemporary usage, including its appropriation in some cultural contexts.\\n\\n2.1 Psychological and Sociological Impacts\\n\\nNumerous studies document the detrimental effects of slurs on mental health, self-perception, and societal cohesion. This section will review research on how such language perpetuates stereotypes, normalizes violence, and undermines equality.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3. The Structural Contradictions of Language and Law\\n\\n3.1 Prohibition of Prayer vs. Tolerance of Slurs\\n\\nModern secular systems often prohibit religious expression, such as prayer, in public spaces to maintain neutrality. However, the tolerance or legal protection of hate speech like \"nigger\" reveals a profound inconsistency. This section will:\\n\\nAnalyze legal frameworks governing free speech and hate speech.\\n\\nContrast the treatment of spiritual expressions and harmful language.\\n\\nExamine the ethical implications of these inconsistencies.\\n\\n3.2 Systemic Inadequacies\\n\\nThe persistence of this slur highlights structural failures in addressing racism. These include:\\n\\nEducational deficits in teaching about historical racism.\\n\\n4.1 Linguistic Accountability and Societal Health\\n\\nLanguage shapes cultural norms and individual behaviors. Allowing derogatory terms like \"nigger\" to persist undermines societal progress. Abolition serves not only as a symbolic act but as a practical step toward dismantling systemic racism.\\n\\n4.2 International Precedents\\n\\nCountries like Germany have outlawed Nazi symbols and hate speech to prevent the perpetuation of oppressive ideologies. This section will analyze these precedents and their applicability to abolishing the word \"nigger.\"\\n\\n4.3 Practical Strategies for Abolition\\n\\nLegislation: Enacting laws to classify the word as hate speech subject to penalties.\\n\\nCultural Transformation: Promoting alternative narratives and redefining societal values through media and art.\\n\\nEducation: Developing curricula that address the history and harm of this word.\\n\\nPrayer, often prohibited in secular systems, represents spiritual and personal empowerment. Its suppression contrasts sharply with the permissibility of language that dehumanizes. This section examines:\\n\\nThe role of prayer in fostering social cohesion and personal resilience.\\n\\nThe systemic bias in prioritizing secular neutrality over human dignity.\\n\\nHow addressing such contradictions can strengthen structural justice.\\n\\nThis paper proposes a unified framework to address linguistic and structural inequities:\\n\\nRestorative Justice: Encouraging reparative dialogue and reconciliation.\\n\\nLegislative Reform: Balancing free speech with protections against harm.\\n\\nGlobal Solidarity: Collaborating across cultures to combat hate speech.\\n\\nThe abolition of the word \"nigger\" represents a critical step in addressing systemic racism and linguistic harm. By treating its usage as a form of societal profligation subject to severe penalties, we signal a commitment to justice and equity. Contrasting this with the prohibition of prayer reveals deep systemic contradictions, underscoring the need for comprehensive reform. A future free of such dehumanizing language is possible through legislative action, cultural transformation, and education.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe word \"nigger\" holds a unique and deeply traumatic position in the history of racial oppression, symbolizing systemic racism and violence. Despite occasional reappropriation within Black communities, its continued use outside these contexts perpetuates harm, discrimination, and psychological trauma. This paper contrasts the societal prohibition of \"prayer\" in certain public or governmental spaces with the tolerated use of racial slurs, highlighting structural inconsistencies. By drawing from historical, psychological, and legal perspectives, this study advocates for the abolition of such language through strict societal and legal frameworks.\\n\\nHistorical Context and Systemic Impacts\\n\\nThe n-word\\'s origin as a tool of dehumanization dates back to slavery and segregation, where it was a prelude to violence, including lynching and other atrocities. Its persistence symbolizes a system that normalizes anti-Blackness and undermines societal equity. Scholars have identified the word as \"the atomic bomb of racial slurs,\" reflecting its uniquely destructive psychological and societal impact. The term reinforces systemic racism by perpetuating stereotypes and fostering environments where discrimination thrives (sources: ADL, Psychology Today).\\n\\nLegal and Psychological Perspectives\\n\\nThe legal system inconsistently addresses hate speech and racial slurs. While hate crimes laws penalize acts motivated by bias, proving intent remains challenging. The n-word often functions as a trigger for violence, demonstrating its potent psychological effects. Studies show that exposure to racial slurs can cause enduring trauma, influencing behaviors and mental health over time (sources: OHCHR, OJP, Psychology Today).\\n\\nStructural Inadequacies: Prayer vs. Hate Speech\\n\\nContrasting the restriction of prayer in public institutions with the leniency towards racial slurs highlights systemic contradictions. Prayer is often prohibited in contexts aiming to uphold neutrality and prevent marginalization. However, the tolerance of racial epithets undermines this neutrality by tacitly endorsing harm against marginalized groups. This inconsistency reveals a structural failure to equitably protect individual dignity and safety.\\n\\nRecommendations\\n\\n1. Abolition Through Legislation: Strengthen hate speech laws to explicitly include the prohibition of racial slurs, with penalties reflecting their societal harm.\\n\\n2. Education and Awareness: Implement educational initiatives to address the history and impact of such language, emphasizing its role in systemic oppression.\\n\\n3. Community Empowerment: Support the reappropriation of language within marginalized communities while discouraging its use by others to prevent perpetuation of harm.\\n\\n4. Structural Reforms: Address systemic biases in policy-making that tolerate harmful language while restricting other forms of expression.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe systemic tolerance of racial slurs like the n-word is a manifestation of structural racism that undermines societal progress. Abolishing such language requires a comprehensive approach involving legal, educational, and social reforms. Addressing this issue not only honors the dignity of those affected but also strengthens the moral and ethical fabric of society.\\n\\nIn the sprawling labyrinth of systemic governance, where laws claim to safeguard dignity and equality, a glaring hypocrisy festers. On one hand, institutions silence prayer -- a quiet invocation of hope, unity, and introspection -- under the guise of secular neutrality. On the other, these same systems shield hate speech, particularly the visceral linguistic weaponry of the word \"nigger,\" cloaking its use in the sanctity of \"free expression.\" This contradiction is not a mere oversight but a seismic failure of moral and structural integrity. The persistence of this slur serves as an indictment of the inadequacies of modern systems, exposing their complicity in perpetuating oppression while masquerading as bastions of liberty.\\n\\n1. Prayer: Silenced Benevolence\\n\\nPrayer, an act of spiritual alignment and communal solace, is systematically expunged from public spaces to uphold secularism. This prohibition is framed as essential to protecting inclusivity, yet it suppresses a harmless, often uplifting practice. The rationale behind this exclusion betrays a fear of offense, yet paradoxically, it allows offensive language -- rooted in hate -- to flourish unchecked.\\n\\n2. The N-Word: Protected Oppression\\n\\nThe n-word, a verbal relic of slavery\\'s barbarity, survives as a cultural anomaly: a word so potent in its dehumanization that it continues to wound across generations. Protected by laws intended to defend expression, it has become a totem of systemic hypocrisy. By tolerating its usage, societies tacitly endorse its underlying ideology -- one that denies humanity and perpetuates racial hierarchies.\\n\\nSanctifying Harm, Criminalizing Hope\\n\\nThe double standard between prayer and slurs unmasks a systemic prioritization of abstract ideals over tangible harm. Prayer, which often fosters connection and resilience, is suppressed as potentially divisive, while slurs, which undeniably fracture the social fabric, are tolerated. This prioritization reveals a skewed moral compass, where the avoidance of ideological discomfort supersedes the protection of human dignity.\\n\\nLegal Contradictions as a Disgrace\\n\\nSecular laws punish expressions of spirituality to preserve neutrality, yet they fail to curtail language explicitly designed to oppress. This contradiction underscores the inadequacy of frameworks that claim to champion equality while upholding structural inequities.\\n\\n1. Legislative Abolition of Hate Speech\\n\\nSocieties must confront their linguistic relics with unflinching clarity. Laws should eradicate racial slurs from public lexicons, treating them as instruments of psychological violence. This abolition would signal a decisive rejection of systemic racism.\\n\\n2. Cultural Renaissance\\n\\nA cultural movement is needed to reclaim linguistic spaces from the shadows of oppression. Through art, education, and public discourse, society must dismantle the normalized violence of slurs while redefining speech as a tool for justice, not harm.\\n\\n3. Reframing Freedom\\n\\nTrue freedom lies not in the unchecked license to harm but in the empowerment of individuals to coexist with dignity. Reframing freedom as responsibility would enable societies to prioritize collective well-being over the preservation of outdated and oppressive norms.\\n\\nThe systemic tolerance of the n-word, juxtaposed with the prohibition of prayer, symbolizes a deep moral chasm. This inconsistency is not just a structural flaw but a betrayal of justice itself. To reclaim societal integrity, we must uproot these double standards and construct frameworks that honor the intrinsic worth of every individual. The abolition of hateful language is not an attack on freedom but its ultimate affirmation -- a visionary step toward a future where words heal rather than harm.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

The flyers stated \"USA ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT HUNTING PERMIT, no bag limit, no tagging required\" and \"Trump 2024.\" The papers were placed on bookshelves and inside a book written in Spanish.\\n\\nThe man allegedly behind the distribution, Daniel Embree, was charged with third-degree harassment.

After months of investigation, Tyler Young was arrested in April. The texts called the men the N-word and monkeys and told them to \"go back to Africa.\"\\n\\nYoung was also charged with damaging the men\\'s vehicles. Hall had corrosive acid poured on his work truck while Hart\\'s car was splattered with paint. He\\'s been charged with second-degree criminal mischief - a felony - for the vandalism, stalking and harassment.\\n\\nMost recently, multiple Black residents received anonymous racist text messages referencing slavery.

The persistence of this slur serves as an indictment of the inadequacies of modern systems, exposing their complicity in perpetuating oppression while masquerading as bastions of liberty.\\n\\n---\\n\\n1. Prayer: Silenced Benevolence\\n\\nPrayer, an act of spiritual alignment and communal solace, is systematically expunged from public spaces to uphold secularism. This prohibition is framed as essential to protecting inclusivity, yet it suppresses a harmless, often uplifting practice. The rationale behind this exclusion betrays a fear of offense, yet paradoxically, it allows offensive language -- rooted in hate -- to flourish unchecked.\\n\\n2. The N-Word: Protected Oppression\\n\\nThe n-word, a verbal relic of slavery\\'s barbarity, survives as a cultural anomaly: a word so potent in its dehumanization that it continues to wound across generations. Protected by laws intended to defend expression, it has become a totem of systemic hypocrisy. By tolerating its usage, societies tacitly endorse its underlying ideology -- one that denies humanity and perpetuates racial hierarchies.\\n\\nSanctifying Harm, Criminalizing Hope\\n\\nThe double standard between prayer and slurs unmasks a systemic prioritization of abstract ideals over tangible harm. Prayer, which often fosters connection and resilience, is suppressed as potentially divisive, while slurs, which undeniably fracture the social fabric, are tolerated. This prioritization reveals a skewed moral compass, where the avoidance of ideological discomfort supersedes the protection of human dignity.\\n\\nLegal Contradictions as a Disgrace\\n\\nSecular laws punish expressions of spirituality to preserve neutrality, yet they fail to curtail language explicitly designed to oppress. This contradiction underscores the inadequacy of frameworks that claim to champion equality while upholding structural inequities.\\n\\n1. Legislative Abolition of Hate Speech\\n\\nSocieties must confront their linguistic relics with unflinching clarity. Laws should eradicate racial slurs from public lexicons, treating them as instruments of psychological Terrorism Nexis. This abolition would signal a decisive rejection of systemic racism.\\n\\n2. Cultural Renaissance\\n\\nA cultural movement is needed to reclaim linguistic spaces from the shadows of oppression. Through art, education, and public discourse, society must dismantle the normalized violence of slurs while redefining speech as a tool for justice, not harm.\\n\\n3. Reframing Freedom\\n\\nTrue freedom lies not in the unchecked license to harm but in the empowerment of individuals to coexist with dignity. Reframing freedom as responsibility would enable societies to prioritize collective well-being over the preservation of outdated and oppressive norms.\\n\\nThe systemic tolerance of the n-word, juxtaposed with the prohibition of prayer, symbolizes a deep moral chasm. This inconsistency is not just a structural flaw but a betrayal of justice itself. To reclaim societal integrity, we must uproot these double standards and construct frameworks that honor the intrinsic worth of every individual. The abolition of hateful language is not an attack on freedom but its ultimate affirmation -- a visionary step toward a future where words heal rather than harm.\\n\\nLet me know if you\\'d like a more expansive development of this framework or if you need specific case studies or precedents woven into the argument.\\n\\nAuthor\\'s Note:\\n\\nThis work delves into the mechanisms of human domination and exploitation, examining the scientific, psychological, and social techniques that have historically underpinned systems of enslavement. The purpose is not to glorify these practices but to expose them, offering insights into the systemic nature of oppression and its lingering effects on contemporary society.\\n\\nEnslavement begins with the dehumanization of a group, achieved through pseudoscientific frameworks like phrenology or genetic determinism, which historically justified racial hierarchies.\\n\\nPsychological manipulation involves redefining identities, labeling the oppressed as \"inferior,\" and reinforcing these ideas through media, education, and policy.\\n\\nCognitive dissonance allowed slaveholders to reconcile moral beliefs with inhumane actions.\\n\\nLearned helplessness among the enslaved was cultivated through consistent punishment, restricting autonomy, and dismantling resilience.\\n\\nTechniques like whipping, starvation, and mutilation served as direct tools of control, conditioning enslaved individuals through fear.\\n\\nModern parallels include systemic incarceration and labor exploitation, which replicate patterns of physical domination.\\n\\nPsychological Chains\\n\\n\"Breaking the will\" through the separation of families, destruction of cultural heritage, and denial of education.\\n\\nStockholm Syndrome and internalized oppression: Psychological phenomena that bind the enslaved to their oppressors emotionally and ideologically.\\n\\nEnslavement thrives on economic incentives. The transatlantic slave trade, for example, reduced individuals to units of labor, commodified for profit.\\n\\nToday, exploitative labor practices, human trafficking, and wage slavery echo historical systems.\\n\\nThe Role of Capitalism\\n\\nEnslavement and exploitation are intertwined with capitalistic systems that prioritize profit over human dignity.\\n\\n\"Debt bondage\" as a modern form of slavery demonstrates the seamless adaptation of enslavement into contemporary economic structures.\\n\\nTerms like \"nigger,\" \"boy,\" or \"property\" served to degrade and reinforce power dynamics.\\n\\nLinguistic control is a subtle yet potent tool, shaping collective consciousness and maintaining hierarchical systems.\\n\\nIndoctrination and Propaganda\\n\\nThe use of religion and education to justify slavery, teaching obedience as a divine mandate.\\n\\nMedia and cultural representations continue to perpetuate stereotypes that validate systemic oppression.\\n\\nEpigenetic studies suggest that the trauma of enslavement has biological consequences, affecting descendants of enslaved populations.\\n\\nCultural fragmentation and identity loss remain scars that hinder societal cohesion.\\n\\nSystemic Continuities\\n\\nPolicing, redlining, and unequal education systems mirror historical mechanisms of control.\\n\\nPsychological oppression persists through implicit biases and structural racism, maintaining a legacy of inequality.\\n\\nCultural revival and education as tools to dismantle historical narratives.\\n\\nEmpowerment through community building and fostering resilience against systemic oppression.\\n\\nJustice and Reparations\\n\\nExploring legal frameworks for reparations as a means of rectifying historical injustices.\\n\\nAdvocating for policy reforms to dismantle systemic oppression and rebuild equitable structures.\\n\\nEnslavement, in its many forms, represents humanity\\'s darkest capabilities. Understanding its mechanisms is the first step toward dismantling oppressive systems and fostering a world where freedom and dignity prevail.\\n\\nConference Research Paper: The Cognitive Science of Subjugation\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nThe systematic subjugation of individuals and groups is deeply rooted in psychological manipulation and cognitive conditioning. This paper explores the cognitive mechanisms underlying subjugation, focusing on learned helplessness, dehumanization, cognitive dissonance, and the interplay of authority and obedience. Drawing on historical examples and modern research, we analyze how these techniques maintain power hierarchies and suggest pathways to resilience and liberation.\\n\\nSubjugation is not solely a product of physical domination but relies heavily on psychological mechanisms to ensure compliance and perpetuate inequality. From slavery and colonialism to modern systems of control, the science of subjugation reveals how cognitive processes are exploited to maintain dominance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n2. Learned Helplessness: Conditioning Compliance\\n\\nCoined by Martin Seligman in the 1960s, learned helplessness occurs when individuals repeatedly experience uncontrollable negative events, leading to resignation and inaction.\\n\\nMechanisms:\\n\\nRepeated exposure to trauma diminishes the belief in personal agency.\\n\\nThis was evident in chattel slavery, where brutal punishment reinforced compliance by eroding resistance efforts.\\n\\nModern Contexts:\\n\\nInstitutional racism and systemic poverty create environments that perpetuate feelings of helplessness, hindering social mobility and fostering generational cycles of dependency.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3. Dehumanization: A Cognitive Justification for Oppression\\n\\nDehumanization involves perceiving others as less than human, reducing empathy and enabling moral disengagement.\\n\\nNeurocognitive Insights:\\n\\nStudies show reduced activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (associated with social cognition) when individuals view dehumanized groups, such as stereotyped images of the homeless or oppressed racial groups.\\n\\nHistorical Applications:\\n\\nEnslavers dehumanized African populations through pseudoscientific classifications, portraying them as biologically inferior.\\n\\nNazi propaganda used dehumanization to justify the Holocaust, depicting Jews as vermin.\\n\\n---\\n\\n4. Cognitive Dissonance: Resolving the Moral Conflict\\n\\nCognitive dissonance theory explains how individuals reconcile conflicting beliefs and actions. In the context of subjugation:\\n\\nHistorical Examples:\\n\\nSlaveholders viewed themselves as moral Christians, rationalizing slavery by constructing narratives of \"civilizing savages\" or using religious justifications.\\n\\nColonial powers framed imperialism as a moral obligation (\"the white man\\'s burden\"), masking exploitation as benevolence.\\n\\nModern Implications:\\n\\nDiscrimination is often justified through stereotypes, reducing dissonance for those complicit in systemic inequality.\\n\\nStanley Milgram\\'s experiments demonstrated how individuals obey authority figures even when it conflicts with personal morality.\\n\\nApplication to Subjugation:\\n\\nIn hierarchical systems like slavery or authoritarian regimes, obedience was enforced through fear and legitimized by societal norms.\\n\\nAuthority figures (e.g., overseers, police) serve as enforcers of systemic control, compelling compliance through perceived legitimacy.\\n\\nInsights from Neuroscience:\\n\\nBrain imaging reveals that individuals defer moral decision-making to authority figures, reducing activation in regions associated with autonomous moral reasoning.\\n\\n---\\n\\n6. Resilience and Liberation: Counteracting Subjugation\\n\\nUnderstanding cognitive mechanisms opens pathways for fostering resistance and psychological liberation.\\n\\nEducation and Critical Thinking:\\n\\nTeaching marginalized groups to recognize and deconstruct oppressive narratives empowers autonomy.\\n\\nCognitive behavioral interventions can help mitigate the effects of learned helplessness.\\n\\nRestoring Humanity:\\n\\nInitiatives that promote empathy and humanize oppressed groups counteract the psychological effects of dehumanization.\\n\\nMedia and cultural representation play critical roles in reshaping perceptions.\\n\\nThe cognitive science of subjugation reveals how psychological manipulation sustains systems of oppression. By understanding these mechanisms, we can develop strategies to dismantle entrenched power dynamics and foster societal resilience. The path to liberation begins with unmasking the mental chains of subjugation, empowering individuals to reclaim their agency and humanity.\\n\\n1. Seligman, M. E. (1972). Learned helplessness.

He considers X to be a \"digital town square\". Through his fierce advocacy, Musk has pushed for a powerful yet not much-talked-about idea: citizen journalism. The eccentric billionaire sees X as a replacement for traditional media platforms, and citizen journalists as substitutes for professional journalists.\\n\\nIn the book, The Medium is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects, Marshall McLuhan wrote, \"Societies have always been shaped more by the nature of the media by which men communicate... It is impossible to understand social and cultural changes without a knowledge of the workings of media.\" This certainly holds true for the post-Musk era of X and his advocacy of citizen journalism.\\n\\nIt is hard to define who a citizen journalist is, since the term is loaded and has a diverse set of scholarly definitions and overlapping meanings. In simple terms, a citizen journalist is any person who engages in journalistic activity but is not a trained reporter or professional. As Musk puts it, citizen journalism is \"...a new model of news, which is to gather information from people who are at the scene, who are experts in the field, summarise the experts in the field and people who are at whatever event is being talked about, and aggregate that into a real-time news feed.\"\\n\\nThe idea of citizen journalism is not new. One could argue that during the Indian freedom struggle, many freedom fighters, who were not professional journalists, brought out their newspapers, magazines, pamphlets, and periodicals to raise awareness of the true nature of the British Raj. They were, in fact, \"citizen journalists\". In 1963, Abraham Zapruder filmed a 26-second horrifying video that recorded the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy. In 2008, when Mumbai was rocked by a cowardly terrorist attack, online platforms were flooded with stories and photos from citizens present near the attack sites. In December 2010, in Tunisia, the video of Mohamed Bouazizi\\'s self-immolation triggered the Jasmine Revolution and the Arab Spring. All these instances are emblematic of citizen journalism.\\n\\nThe rise of new technologies has given a boost to citizen journalism. It is challenging traditional media, breaking down the silos and walls that once existed between institutional news dissemination and the roles citizens now play in it. Gone are the days when only journalists and media houses were the gatekeepers of information. Now, for those willing, there are plenty of mediums and platforms to broadcast events, views, and information.\\n\\nTraditional media is competing with two forces. The first is the competition from new technologies and newer mediums. The second is the competition from the \"former\" audience, who have turned into journalists, thanks to mobile cameras and the internet. As Elon Musk tweeted, \"...You are the media now\" and \"...You can do live video easily from your phone.\"\\n\\nThe rise of citizen journalism is also attributed to the reputational damage suffered by serious journalism due to the commercial and other vested interests of media conglomerates. Once a venerable profession, journalism has been tarnished by the insidious rise of yellow-page journalism, where news is used to manipulate public opinion, rather than being a noble pursuit of speaking truth to power. The media has largely ceased to be a profitable business, as advertisers shift to online platforms. Yet, the rich and powerful continue to pour money into it to harness, create, and maintain favourable public opinion and political power.\\n\\nThe people who were supposed to be the vanguard of journalism became fixated on maintaining the status quo, reflected in their complacent attitude and institutional biases. Traditional media today lacks passion. \"Many big-media journalists are now cautious, well-paid conformists, distant from their audiences and more responsive to urban elites, powerful people, and mega-corporations -- especially the ones they work for,\" says journalist James Poniewozik.\\n\\nTake, for example, a survey conducted by the Pew Research Centre, which found that \"about three-quarters of US adults (73 per cent) say they have seen inaccurate news coverage about the election at least somewhat often, including 37 per cent who have seen this kind of information extremely or very often.\" Musk, a product of media glorification, has fiercely criticised mainstream \"legacy\" media and has argued that in citizen journalism \"people are able to disseminate news without an establishment bias.\" He believes that this type of journalism is \"infinitely superior\" and \"breaks the monopoly held by a handful of editors.\"\\n\\nBut the remedy provided by citizen journalism might be worse than the malady. Due to traditional media being run through a centralised structure, it is easier for a willing state to set accountability. This becomes a challenge in a highly decentralised setup. As far as the legacy media\\'s institutional bias is concerned, citizen journalism will also fall victim to individual biases. Online platforms are repositories of confirmation biases, propelled by algorithms, which will also manifest in citizen journalism. Currently, non-traditional platforms are used to call out the recognised biases of legacy media. But when social media itself becomes an echo chamber, recognising bias becomes impossible, and no one is there to call it out.\\n\\nCitizen journalism, despite all its claims of an \\'ideal speech situation\\', degrades into a space of vitriol, racism, bigotry, misinformation, rumours, and hate speech.\\n\\nRecently, The Guardian quit the X platform, citing \"disturbing content\", including racism. The World Bank ceased paid advertising on \\'X\\' after advertisements were shown under a racist post, according to a CBS News report in September 2024. According to a report by CNN, Musk publicly endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jewish communities push \"hatred against Whites.\" Musk called an antisemitic tweet \"the actual truth\", which accused Jewish people of undermining Western civilisation by supporting immigration. Research conducted by ISD and CASM Technology for BBC Panorama revealed that when Elon Musk took over \\'X\\', it fostered an environment that allowed thousands of new accounts to quickly begin following channels known for misogynistic content on the platform.\\n\\nWhat is true for the relationship between legacy media and the rich is also true for citizen journalism and social media. Take the case of X and Elon Musk, for the road to hell is paved with good intentions. He claimed neutrality and a level playing field for all sides. However, as The New York Times reported, \"It has become starkly evident that the left, the Democrats, do not have the same social media platforms to push their agenda... It has left Democrats in a huge deficit.\" Elon Musk, like other billionaires, wanted to have his medium, and he grabbed it at a huge premium.\\n\\nWalter Isaacson, in the authorised biography of Musk, called it out: \"Over the years, whenever he was in a dark place or felt threatened, it took him back to the horrors of being bullied on the playground. Now he had the chance to own the playground.\"\\n\\nJournalism is a professional pursuit requiring special skills, training, and expertise. Though citizens can participate and connect constructively with the news process, they cannot replace journalists and institutionalised journalism.\\n\\nIn 2014, speaking to a digital news publication, senior journalist Shekhar Gupta said, \"I don\\'t believe in citizen journalists. I say give me citizen doctors and citizen lawyers, and I\\'ll give you citizen journalists. We learn the journalistic skill, we come with bullshit detectors, which get better with age and experience.\" Journalism is an exercise in sophistication, requiring an understanding of the system, devouring documents in search of information, conducting investigations, and having the courage to question the newsmakers.\\n\\nHowever, traditional media cannot afford to have a snobbish and disdainful attitude towards the public. It will have to accept that people cannot be excluded, and the process must be made participatory. People need someone who listens to them without arrogance or claiming moral high ground. The onus is on legacy journalists to be passionate and innovative. The letters to editors are one such way of making people feel heard.\\n\\nCitizen journalism, despite its lofty ideals of equality, is also dominated by a privileged few who possess the technical means, educational know-how, and time to spare. The masses remain voiceless and unheard, a vacuum that has also persisted in legacy media. Journalists, newsmakers, and the audience, with a bottom-up approach, need to fill this gap and build an equitable space for those who require the news the most but are also the most ignored in the process. A mob claiming to represent the masses is as harmful as the select few deciding for the masses.\\n\\nIn the past, institutional journalists and journalism have faced many crises head-on. However, due to the velocity of technological changes, the media space is far more fragmented, with more claimants than ever before. It is more contested, as the former audience -- enabled by the pervasiveness of the internet and driven by the faltering credibility of traditional media -- is taking matters into their own hands. The onus is on professional journalists to improve their standing and ensure the restoration of trust in once-revered institutional journalism. People need credible news, but not from sources that disguise avarice behind the gauzy language of objectivity and impartiality, nor from people shouting from soapboxes.'}\n",

They have the capacity and resources to protect an event if they wanted to.\"\\n\\nAnother bookshop that cancelled a few weeks ago after receiving threats has now pulled out of plans to restage the event in December after getting new threats immediately after it was listed online.\\n\\nThreats have been made by email and in phone calls, while extremists from groups angered by Hope Not Hate\\'s work have been publishing numbers on social media and urging supporters to call.\\n\\nPolice were called to a branch of Waterstones in late September when a far-right activist took a seat in the front row and attempted to disrupt the event.\\n\\nThe development has shocked artists and veterans of anti-racist campaigns who had believed the days of venues being in fear of the far right had been consigned to the past.\\n\\nBut the summer violence - described by Keir Starmer as far-right riots - has contributed to a changed atmosphere. It comes after the far right and conspiracy theorists have mobilised aggressive protests against venues hosting shows featuring drag queens reading to young children.\\n\\nBragg, the socialist singer-songwriter whose own anti-fascist activism through music features in Mulhall\\'s book, told the Guardian: \"This reminds me of the 1970s and 80s when we had to do solidarity gigs for people.\\n\\n\"People\\'s safety is so important but we need to stand up to this kind of thing, which really is a freedom of speech issue and in this case there are threats of violence.\"\\n\\nKureishi, whose fiction has drawn from his own experience of the threat posed to British Asians by the National Front in his youth, said he was shocked to hear about Mulhall\\'s experience. Another British writer, Guy Gunaratne, said: \"That these readings are now being conducted clandestinely should concern everyone committed to free speech.\"\\n\\nJemimah Steinfeld, the CEO of Index on Censorship, said she was concerned about what appeared to be a \"worrying trend\". \"If even an organisation like the BFI is afraid then what hope is there for smaller venues and what message does it send out? You have to put the people working at those places first, but we are also seeing a retreat into safer spaces and it\\'s something we as a society will regret.\"\\n\\nDaniel Gorman, the director of English PEN, said: \"English PEN is deeply concerned that threats from the far right have led to venues cancelling planned events with writers and artists. This is part of a worrying trend curtailing the freedom of expression of authors and performers.\"\\n\\nLast month the LFF cancelled the screening of Undercover: Exposing the Far Right, a documentary that followed Hope Not Hate campaigners. It remains unclear whether the BFI was acting in the face of viable threats.\\n\\nKristy Matheson, the director of the LFF, said: \"I took onboard the expert opinion of colleagues around the safety and wellbeing risks that the screening could have created for audiences and the team and that informed our decision.\"\\n\\nThe documentary\\'s director, Havana Marking, said: \"I don\\'t think it as taken seriously enough in London at the beginning and then there was a panic. What needs to really happen now is that there is a conversation to ensure this does not happen again.\"'}\n",

It highlighted online shopping scams as most prevalent and surpassing identity fraud.\\n\\nThere has also been a 12% increase in sextortion reports, with at least 43 cases each week. Deepfake activity is becoming more prevalent, and hate speech and racism is also up.\\n\\nThis aligns with an almost 25% increase in people using Netsafe\\'s harmful digital communications helpline and more than 375,000 unique website visitors seeking tips and tools to navigate online safety challenges.\\n\\nNetsafe CEO Brent Carey says the digital environment is evolving rapidly and changes to the HDCA are required to ensure the country is protected from online harm in the future.\\n\\n\"The advancements in deep fake technology are an example of how New Zealand\\'s legal framework not keeping pace.

Above all, peace!\\n\\nPeace in Ukraine - a just peace in line with the UN Charter, international law and General Assembly resolutions.\\n\\nPeace in Gaza -- with an immediate cease-fire, the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, the effective and unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid, and the beginning of an irreversible process towards a two-State solution.\\n\\nPeace in Lebanon -- with an immediate cessation of hostilities, and the full implementation of Security Council resolutions.\\n\\nPeace in Sudan -- with all parties silencing their guns and committing to a path towards sustainable peace.\\n\\nEverywhere, we must uphold the values of the UN Charter and International Law, including the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence of all States.\\n\\nExcellencies,\\n\\nThe absence of peace is leading to an erosion of trust.\\n\\nIn the multilateral system, in societies, and in one another.\\n\\nRebuilding trust is our essential task.\\n\\nAnd this makes the work of the Alliance of Civilizations more important than ever.\\n\\nI see four crucial areas where we must expand our efforts -- in communities, online, across cultures and institutions.\\n\\nFirst, we need to build communities of trust and belonging.\\n\\nThese are the foundation of more peaceful, just and resilient societies, based on human rights and dignity for all.\\n\\nBuilding trust and cohesion cannot be done by governments or institutions alone.\\n\\nWe need voices and action across all levels, including grassroots organisations, marginalised communities, local authorities and religious groups.\\n\\nThe role of religious leaders is especially crucial.\\n\\nWe need meaningful participation of women in decision-making, including in leadership positions.\\n\\nAnd we need to spotlight the vital voices of young people.\\n\\nI commend you for pioneering initiatives on strengthening the role of women as peacemakers.\\n\\nAnd I welcome the many alumni of your youth programs here today -- including from the Youth Solidarity Fund and the Intercultural Innovation Hub.\\n\\nSecond, we must reign in hate speech and disinformation spreading online.\\n\\nHate-filled frenzies are perpetuating stereotypes and misconceptions.\\n\\nMisinformation and outright lies are fueling repulsive antisemitism, anti-Muslim bigotry and attacks on minority Christian communities, among others.\\n\\nThese are old tactics with a new medium.\\n\\nUnchecked digital platforms and Artificial Intelligence have endowed hate speech with a speed and reach unseen before.\\n\\nThe worst impulses of humanity are given a megaphone, and many times they lead to violence.\\n\\nWith the proliferation of deepfakes, the impossible and the unverified become credible in an instant.\\n\\nBut we do have constructive ways to address these and other challenges.\\n\\nFor example, through the United Nations Global Principles for Information Integrity which have put forward recommendations for a more humane information ecosystem.\\n\\nCountries also adopted a major new initiative -- the Global Digital Compact -- which is aimed at fostering a safe and secure digital space that respects and protects human rights.\\n\\nI also welcome the Alliance\\'s \"Plural Plus\" joint initiative with the International Organization for Migration.\\n\\nThrough the initiative, young media and filmmakers explore the topic of migration and social inclusion, and provide a counter narrative to the negative portrayal of migrants and refugees.\\n\\nBut the buck does not stop with these efforts.\\n\\nBig tech companies, advertisers, and media outlets must take responsibility for their role.\\n\\nThe Global Digital Compact also emphasizes the importance of supporting cultural diversity in the digital space.\\n\\nThat leads me to the third area - working harder to fully embrace the role of culture and cultural diversity to advance all our goals.\\n\\nSocieties today are multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural.\\n\\nThis diversity is a richness and our greatest strength, not a threat.\\n\\nRespecting and representing all cultures builds trust in society.\\n\\nAnd at a time of spreading hatred and intolerance, we must not only defend diversity but we must invest in it.\\n\\nHarnessed effectively, cultural diversity can be a powerhouse of ideas and innovation.\\n\\nFourth, rebuilding trust calls for institutions that are more representative.\\n\\nMore representative institutions mean more effective institutions.\\n\\nYet today, multilateral peace and security tools, and the global financial architecture, are products of a bygone era.\\n\\nThe Security Council is outdated and frequently paralysed.\\n\\nMeanwhile the International Financial Architecture does not reflect today\\'s economy and has become inadequate and unfair.\\n\\nWe need to keep working to strengthen global governance - and that is precisely the central tenet of the Pact for the Future -- adopted by consensus at the United Nations in September.\\n\\nIt calls for decisive steps towards updating and reforming international cooperation to make it more networked, fair and inclusive.\\n\\nThe Pact also reinforces the call of the Alliance for inclusive, just societies rooted in human rights, respect for religious communities, and intercultural dialogue.\\n\\nExcellencies and friends,\\n\\nIn these turbulent times, too many people are convinced that differences must define us.\\n\\nBut the most powerful force of all is the recognition that we are more united by our common fate than divided by our distinct identities.\\n\\nThat is the essence of the United Nations - and the raison d\\'être of the Alliance of Civilizations.\\n\\nLet\\'s stand together with our shared faith in humanity.\\n\\nOne planet.\\n\\nOne human family.\\n\\nRich in diversity.\\n\\nEqual in dignity and rights.\\n\\nAnd united in solidarity.\\n\\nI thank all of you for your leadership and commitment.'}\n",

This climate of hostility is characterized by systemic discrimination, violent assaults, and state-sanctioned actions against Muslim communities.\\n\\nRecently, Muslim victims have urged the Indian Supreme Court to intervene against the arbitrary demolition of properties owned by Muslims, a practice dubbed \"Bulldozer Justice\" that targets alleged illegal structures under the pretext of urban development. This trend reflects a broader pattern of violence and discrimination including the recent sentencing of Muslim converts under anti-conversion laws which stifles their religious freedom and autonomy.\\n\\nExperts from the third ministerial conference of Justice for All (JFA) have warned that rising Islamophobia could lead to genocide against Muslims in India. This sentiment is echoed in various protests such as those against housing for Muslim single mothers which reveal deep rooted institutionalized bigotry within Modi\\'s regime. The violent assaults on Muslims during Ramadan prayers at Gujarat University further illustrate their vulnerability in a country that claims to uphold secular values.\\n\\nIn Gujarat, Muslims face exclusion from housing in Hindu dominated areas, perpetuating a form of modern-day apartheid. The Indian government has suppressed dissenting voices from religious minorities through surveillance and harassment, often utilizing laws like the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) to stifle advocacy efforts. High profile BJP member Gyan Dev Ahuja have incited violence against Muslims by calling for the killing of anyone involved in slaughter of cow, which exacerbated communal tensions across states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\nViolent assaults on Muslims during Ramadan prayers at Gujarat University illustrate their vulnerability in a country that claims to uphold secular values.\\n\\nRenowned Bollywood actor turned BJP leader Mithun Chakraborty made ferocious statements cum threats against Muslims. He made a statement against a Muslim TMC leader stating \"If you throw in the Bhagirathi, we will also one day... not in the Bhagirathi because it is our mother... but we will bury you on the other side. Aap hamare jhaad ka ek fal todoge toh hum aapke jhaad ka char fal tod denge\"\\n\\nFurther he stated, \"In 2026 (the next Assembly elections), the masnad (throne) will be ours (the BJP\\'s) and we will do everything to achieve the goal... Kuch bhi karenge, kuch bhi. Main Home Minister sahab ke saamne bol raha hoon. Kuch bhi ke andar bahut sara matlab chupa hua hai\"\\n\\nRecent reports indicate a troubling rise in hate speech incidents against Muslims in India, particularly linked to the ruling Baharatiya Janata Party (BJP). A report by Hindutva Watch documented 255 incidents of hate speech targeting Muslims with approximately 80 percent of these incidents occurring in states governed by the BJP during the first half of 2023. A significant portion of documented hate speech incidents, approximately one-third, has been attributed to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and the Bajrang Dal.\\n\\nCIA has categorized both these groups as \"religious militant organizations\". Both VHP & Bajran Dal are linked to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) which serves as the ideological foundation for the Baharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This alarming situation highlights a significant trend in the politicization of communal tensions under Modi\\'s administration which has been criticized for fostering an environment where such rhetoric is increasingly normalized. Later on, BJP government has blocked platforms tracking hate crimes like Hindutva Watch and India Hate Lab under controversial IT act, 2000.\\n\\nSocial media plays a significant role in fueling Islamophobia with platforms facilitating the spread of hate speech and disinformation. Reports indicate that nearly two anti-Muslim hate speech incidents occur daily, with many linked to political campaigns led by the BJP. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) further marginalize Muslims by putting hundreds of thousands at risk of statelessness, particularly in Assam.\\n\\nThe destruction of property in predominantly Muslim neighborhoods has intensified under BJP rule, contributing to increased religious tensions. Civil society organizations have approached the Supreme Court to halt these demolitions and protect minority rights.\\n\\nThe international community is urged to demand action against rising Islamophobia and advocate for protective measures for minority communities in India. Furthermore, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) must organize campaigns addressing housing discrimination against Muslim single mothers and promote inclusive policies. World governing bodies should compel the Indian government to ensure protection for minorities during religious observances.\\n\\nThe plight of Muslim women illustrates an intersection of gender and religious discrimination as they face harassment at both local and state levels. The ongoing violence not only threatens their safety but also fuels existing inequalities within society.\\n\\nIn short, Islamophobia in India manifests through systemic discrimination, violent acts against Muslims, and state-supported initiatives that undermine their rights. The urgent need for civil society mobilization against discriminatory laws like the CAA and NRC is paramount to safeguarding citizenship rights for Muslims. As tensions rise, it is crucial for both domestic and international actors to advocate for justice and equality for all religious communities in India.'}\n",

The complaints highlight hate speech delivered by habitual hate offenders during the election period, urging the Chief Election Officer (CEO) S. Chockalingam to direct registration of FIRs under Sections 123(2), 123(3), and 123(3A) of the Representation of People\\'s Act, 1951. Three of the complaints were filed against Suresh Chavhanke, the editor-in-chief of Sudarshan News, for his inflammatory speeches in Jalgaon (Nov 8), Akola (Nov 13), and Pathanpura (Nov 11). Another complaint accuses Harsha Thakur of making divisive comments in Delgur (Nanded) on October 29, while the fifth complaint involves BJP Rajya Sabha MP Dhananjay Mahadik for his communal speech during an election rally in Kolhapur. These actions, CJP claims, violated MCC guidelines and electoral laws.\\n\\nOn November 15, 2024, CJP filed a complaint before the CEO Maharashtra regarding the gross violation of MCC in Jalgaon, Maharashtra, due to the hate-filled rhetoric of Suresh Chavhanke. Chavhanke\\'s speech at the Janata-NRC event blatantly violated the MCC and undermined the principles of free and fair elections as pleaded by the CJP in its complaint. The said speech was delivered by Suresh Chavhanke at the Janta-NRC event on November 8, 2024, in Jalgaon, Maharashtra.\\n\\nIn his address, Chavhanke explicitly targeted Muslim citizens by misrepresenting Islamic symbols, falsely claiming that the crescent and star, often associated with Islam, belonged not to Islam but to the Muslim League, and linking it to the creation of Pakistan. He further propagated misinformation by associating the true Islamic flag with extremist ideologies. Referring to Muslims as \"infiltrators\" and calling for their removal to \"save Maharashtra,\" he sought to fuel communal tensions. Additionally, he promoted the baseless \"Vote Jihad\" conspiracy, accusing Muslims of using elections to wage a religious war, inciting division and hostility.\\n\\nCJP mentioned in its complaint that \"This statement is highly provocative and anti-Muslim because it labels Muslims as \"infiltrators\" and associates them with a threat to India\\'s integrity. The call to \"drive out the infiltrators\" implies that Muslims are unwelcome outsiders, fostering fear and hatred. The comparison of the saffron flag to the Tricolor and the assertion that without saffron, the Tricolor will \"turn green\" insinuates that Muslims, symbolized by green, pose a threat to national unity. Furthermore, the term \"vote Jihad\" equates Muslim political participation to religious warfare, encouraging communal hostility and framing elections as a religious battle, thus deepening divisions.\\n\\nThe video can be accessed through this link: https: https://t.me/hindutvawatchin/802\\n\\n2. Akola [November 13, 2024] & 3. Pathanpura (Mangrulpir) [November 11, 2024]\\n\\nSpeaker - Suresh Chavhanke\\n\\nOn November 21, 2024, CJP filed a complaint regarding the hate-filled speeches delivered by Suresh Chavhanke, editor-in-chief of Sudarshan News, in Akola and Pathanpura (Mangrulpir), Maharashtra. Chavhanke\\'s speeches, delivered on November 13, 2024, in Akola and November 11, 2024, in Pathanpura, contained clear examples of hate speech, particularly targeting the Muslim community. Throughout his speeches, Chavhanke used derogatory terms like \"love jihad,\" \"intruders,\" and \"jihadists,\" portraying Muslims as a threat to national security and fueling fear by labeling them as \"infiltrators\" from neighboring countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Myanmar.\\n\\nFurthermore, Chavhanke invoked historical figures such as \"Aurangzeb\" and \"Tipu Sultan\" to vilify Muslims, manipulating religious sentiments to create division. He also urged voters to support laws targeting Muslims, including \"cow protection\" and the baseless \"love jihad\" conspiracy. This inflammatory rhetoric was designed to incite hatred and polarize communities. CJP\\'s complaint highlighted that Chavhanke\\'s speeches violated the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) and sections 123(2), 123(3), and 123(3A) of the Representation of the People Act (RP Act), 1951, which prohibit hate speech and the incitement of religious division during election periods, as per CJP\\'s complaint.\\n\\nCJP said in its complaint that, \"By linking political choices to religious identity and inciting voters to act against Muslim communities, the speaker attempts to polarize the election along religious lines. The call to vote based on laws like \"love jihad\" or \"cow protection\" further encourages discrimination, suggesting that the Muslim community is responsible for crimes against Hindu women or society. This creates a hostile, divisive atmosphere, undermining the principles of free and fair elections.\"\\n\\nOn November 21, 2024, CJP filed a complaint regarding the anti-Muslim and communal hate speech delivered by right-wing leader Harsha Thakur at a public event in Delgur, Nanded, Maharashtra. Thakur, campaigning for independent Hindu nationalist candidate Dr. Virupaksha Maharaj, made inflammatory remarks that blatantly violated the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) and undermined free and fair elections. On October 29, 2024, Thakur\\'s speech contained divisive rhetoric, calling for Hindus to avoid supporting those who allegedly sided with other religious communities.\\n\\nShe warned that if Sharia law were implemented, valuable land would be transferred to the Waqf Board, inciting fear and communal tension. Thakur further urged voters to prioritize religious unity over caste-based voting. Her comments, intended to stoke division, violated MCC provisions by inciting religious hatred and manipulating religious sentiments for electoral gain. CJP emphasized that these statements contravened Sections 123(2), 123(3), and 123(3A) of the Representation of the People Act (RP Act), 1951.\\n\\nAccording to CJP\\'s complaint in her speech, Thakur urged voters that, \"Don\\'t vote for a candidate who gives employment to Muslims!\" and further stated, \"India will never work on Sharia law,\" while also spreading unfounded fears about the Waqf Board. This rhetoric is not only inflammatory but also divisive, promoting religious intolerance and fear-mongering. By appealing to voters on religious lines and stoking fear about Muslims and their institutions, Thakur\\'s speech creates a dangerous environment of communal polarization.\"\\n\\nThe video can be accessed through this link: https: https://t.me/hindutvawatchin/825\\n\\nOn November 15, 2024, CJP approached the CEO Maharashtra with a complaint against BJP Rajya Sabha MP Dhananjay Mahadik, following his controversial remarks at a rally in Kolhapur, Maharashtra. In a video that surfaced, Mahadik was seen instructing party workers to target women beneficiaries of the Ladki Bahini Yojana attending Congress rallies. He directed his supporters to photograph or film these women and report back to him. His statement, \"I will teach those women a lesson,\" was a clear attempt to intimidate and surveil women based on their political affiliations. These actions were seen as an explicit violation of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) and the Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1951.\\n\\nCJP argued that Mahadik\\'s directive not only threatened women\\'s rights to political participation but also used a government welfare scheme intended for empowerment as a tool for political control. The complaint called for immediate action under electoral laws to address this form of intimidation.\\n\\nThe video can be accessed through this link: https://x.com/HateDetectors/status/1856274208646672512\\n\\nNotably, CJP played a pivotal role in monitoring the assembly elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, vigilantly flagging complaints of hate speech and violations of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC). Their persistent efforts resulted in the registration of FIRs against Suresh Chavhanke and Kajal Hindustani in Maharashtra for delivering inflammatory speeches that breached MCC guidelines.\\n\\nRelated:\\n\\nCJP files 3 MCC violation complaints with CEO Maharashtra against Suresh Chavhanke for hate speech\\n\\nCJP\\'s fight against Hate: FIR filed against Suresh Chavhanke for Hate Speech at Karad event'}\n",

CJP\\'s complaint highlighted how the speech violated the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) by inciting religious hatred and political division.

The CJP complaint highlighted that Chavhanke\\'s speech, laden with Islamophobic and divisive content, not only violated ethical standards of political discourse but also breached the MCC, which governs the conduct of political leaders during the election period.\\n\\nIn the speech, Chavhanke allegedly claimed that Europe would soon cease to exist due to a Muslim takeover, making inflammatory statements about the growing Muslim population in India. He further propagated the debunked \"love jihad\" conspiracy theory and stated that India was at risk from \"10 crore infiltrators,\" referring to Muslims as a threat to Hindu culture and suggesting that they should be expelled from the country. These remarks, according to the CJP, were designed to create fear, manipulate public sentiment, and divide communities along religious lines.\\n\\nCJP\\'s complaint, while condemning the hate speech, also referenced a recent FIR filed in Thane against another individual, Kajal Hindustani, for delivering a similar hate speech.\\n\\nKey Allegations in the Speech\\n\\nThe complaint provides an in-depth analysis of Chavhanke\\'s speech, citing several excerpts that they argued violated the legal framework meant to ensure a fair and peaceful election process. The speech, according to the complaint, sought to create a sense of insecurity among Hindus by presenting Muslims as a demographic threat, manipulating fears about rising Muslim populations, and linking this to supposed threats like \"Love Jihad\" and \"Land Jihad.\"\\n\\nOne of the most controversial claims made by Chavhanke was the assertion that India faced a crisis of \"infiltrators,\" with an estimated 10 crore illegal Muslim immigrants in the country. He further suggested that the growing Muslim population would soon make Hindus a minority in several states by 2048. His remarks regarding Muslims being an \"economic burden\" on the nation and his demand for their expulsion were, according to the CJP, an incitement to religious hatred.\\n\\nChavhnake said in his speech that, \"There are 10 crore intruders sitting in India. 1 crore in Maharashtra. 40 lakhs in Mumbai. 3.5 lakhs in your district. Infiltrators, those who came into the country without permission. Illegal citizens. Get this illegal citizen out now. Is it legal to say so or not? Is it morally right or not? Practical or not?

Don\\'t the unbearable scenes we see on television make any discussion on civilization look out of touch?\"\\n\\nShe said there is no other way to deal with civilization than discussion based on equal rights embedded in the UN Charter and international framework.\\n\\nKing Don Felipe VI of Spain told delegates that \"in the 21st century, diplomacy is a tool of peace, but its traditional tools are outdated and must be supplemented with new spheres of action, more boldness, creativity and pragmatism.\"\\n\\n\"We must raise our vision to more deeply understand what unites us,\" King Don Felipe VI said. \"The Alliance of Civilizations is the implementation of what is known as the diplomacy of values, tearing down walls and building bridges,\" he added. \"Our actions must go beyond conference rooms, to school, places where people gather and the marketplace.\"\\n\\nIn this regard, he said, social media is potential as a catalyst in this regard, he said, pointing to the Alliance\\'s Youth Solidarity Fund, which was featured on day one of the 10th Global Forum.\\n\\nStill, a great deal more needs to be done, he said. At a time when dehumanisation is a growing problem, he emphasised that efforts must aim at eliminating stereotypes and ensuring that the wealth of human diversity is beneficial for everyone.\\n\\nIn a similar vein, UN Secretary-General Guterres said that the absence of peace is leading to an erosion of trust, making the Alliance of Civilizations\\'s work more important than ever before.\\n\\n\"Rebuilding trust is our essential task,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Hate-filled frenzies are perpetuating stereotypes and misconceptions,\" the UN chief said. Unchecked digital platforms and AI have endowed hate speech with a speed and reach unseen before. We must rein in hate speech and disinformation spreading online.\"\\n\\nThe Alliance\\'s High Representative Miguel Ángel Moratinos renewed a call for an alliance for peace to put an end to violence and extremism and wars in the 21st century.\\n\\n\"Biodiversity needs to be protected, but what about human diversity?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"We need to make peace with nature, and we need to make peace with ourselves,\" he said, emphasizing that the Alliance is the best platform to do so.'}\n",

So I think the danger of all of this is access to the members who make decisions on resolutions. Who make UN policy,\" says Gillian Kane, director of global policy and research at Ipas, a non-governmental organisation that focuses on advancing gender equity and reducing the harm of U.S. foreign policy.\\n\\nKane, who attended the November Summit, says this status \"legitimises these groups\" who have clear track records that conflict with the core principles of the UN, like the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing subtle about what they do. They hate gays and they\\'re unapologetic to go after it,\" says Kane.\\n\\nMany of these groups have been around for decades, advocating against the LGBTQIA+ community. Kao\\'s group, ADF, published a press release titled \"ADF increases global impact with new status at United Nations\" when they were granted consultative status in 2010. \"ADF can now have a say when UN treaties and conventions are drafted that directly impact religious liberty and important matters related to the sanctity of life, marriage, and the family,\" the release said. It goes on to say that \"ADF will now be able to monitor and provide input on matters\" affecting religious freedoms.\\n\\nThe group, which consists of hundreds of lawyers in the U.S. and around the globe, was founded in 1994 by Alan Sears, who co-authored The Homosexual Agenda: Exposing the Principal Threat to Religious Freedom Today. Since then, they have advocated at the state and federal level for laws that promote conversion therapy and that would ban gays from serving in the military. In addition, they\\'ve testified in favour of laws that would strip transgender folks of the right to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity, that would prevent them from changing the name on their birth certificate and that would ban their access to gender affirming healthcare.\\n\\nIn addition, they have been effective globally through their international arm, ADF International. In 2012 in Jamaica, they advocated for the retention of a a law that criminalises gay sex. That law remains in effect. And in 2013, members of ADF worked to defend a Belize statute that makes anyone engaging in LGBTQIA+ sex subject to a punishment of up to 10 years in prison.\\n\\nThe other groups -- which include the Howard Center for Family Religion and Society (now known as International Organization for Family), Family Research Council, the Association of United Families International and the American Family Association of New York -- all have similar track records.\\n\\nSubscribe now\\n\\nFamily Research Council has advocated in favor of conversion therapy laws and continues to publish articles that falsely assert that \"sexual orientation change efforts\" are effective for gay people. And Tim Wildmon, the President of the American Family Association, is currently advocating for a boycott of Target for allowing trans people to use the bathroom or dressing room that matches their gender identity.\\n\\n\"Please use #BoycottTarget,\" Wildmon wrote in a special update on their website.\\n\\nBecause of these track records, Beirich felt it was \"a no brainer\" to add them to the SPLC\\'s list of hate groups alongside the Ku Klux Klan, the American Defense Skinheads and Aryan Nations.\\n\\n\"We put them on the hate list because they demonise the entire LGBTQIA+ population in derogatory, dehumanising language, just like the Klan would with Black people or Jewish people,\" says Beirich, now the co-founder and chief strategy officer at the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.\\n\\n\"People in the Christian right who have long demonised the LGBTQIA+ community have political power in this country, and it\\'s more normalised to hate queer people than to hate Black people for no damn good reason. Which is what we\\'re talking about. So it\\'s the biblically informed aspect of it that somehow legitimises it,\" says Beirich, who adds that she has \"absolutely no idea\" how these groups secured this status.\\n\\nSo how do these groups get here? While they all conform to basic principles required for Special Consultative Status, such as being a registered nonprofit and having specialised expertise on issues relevant to the UN, they are also expected to act in conformity with \"the spirit, purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,\" which specifically states that members must promote and encourage respect for human rights, take action \"to strengthen universal peace\" and -- specifically for members with consultative status -- must promote policies that encourage \"social progress.\"\\n\\nNeil Datta, the executive director for the European Parliamentary Forum for Sexual and Reproductive Rights, says part of the reason these groups are granted this status is due to overworked civil servants who work for the NGO Branch of the UN and are in charge of a preliminary screening of these applicants.\\n\\n\"The folks reviewing these applications are not necessarily thematic experts on anything. So they\\'re tasked with a very dry job of processing different applications that come in, and very legitimately won\\'t know what all of these different groups are,\" he says. \"Imagine you had 15 climate groups applying and one didn\\'t believe in climate change. It\\'s not necessarily that easy to understand.\"\\n\\nDatta says it can be even harder to identify anti-LGBTQIA+ groups because they often operate under the guise of protecting the family or the rights of the child.\\n\\n\"These groups have very nice names that aren\\'t obviously anti-LGBTQIA+. And so the people reviewing these applications may not be able to pick up on some of the subtleties,\" he says.\\n\\nIn addition, Datta says these groups use \"very clever vocabulary\" that sounds well meaning. But really, they are weaponising this language to penetrate powerful institutions like the UN \"In reality, they\\'re using religious freedom as a fig leaf for hate speech.\"\\n\\n\"But if you know your Catholic social doctrine, then you will recognise [this vocabulary] immediately.\" Datta says common dog whistles such as \"common good\" or \"human dignity\" and \"in favour of life [or] of the family\" are used almost exclusively to limit the human rights of others, \"usually in sexuality and reproduction.\"\\n\\nDatta says these \"codewords\" are another reason these groups go unnoticed within the UN. For example, during a three hour meeting at the November Transatlantic Summit event, participants used the term \"human dignity\" over 30 times.\\n\\nAfter they get through the preliminary screening by UN civil servants, their application is reviewed by the NGO Committee -- which meets twice a year -- to decide who they will recommend for Special Consultative Status. After review, the recommended organisations are presented to ECOSOC for their final decision.\\n\\nThis committee includes 19 countries, including multiple countries that have extremely hostile policies against LGBTQIA+ people, like Algeria, where homosexual activity is punishable by up to two years in prison; and Eritrea, where homosexuality is illegal and can be punished with jail-time.\\n\\n\"It honestly depends on who\\'s sitting on that committee. So if you have countries that already have anti-LGBTQIA+ policies in place, they\\'re going to be friendly to inviting these groups in and approving their status,\" says Kane.\\n\\nOnce these groups officially gain this status, they use religious freedom as a justification for promoting policies and laws that limit the rights of LGBTQIA+ people through the UN apparatus.\\n\\nThe UN Declaration of Human Rights does not yet explicitly protect folks who are discriminated against for their sexual orientation or gender identity. This lack of protection has given anti-LGBTQIA+ groups leverage in their arguments to roll back the rights of LGBTQIA+ folks.\\n\\nInside the UN, there are efforts to change this. For example, in 2019 the Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect published a Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech that outlines what constitutes hate speech and how to combat it. In it, they describe hate speech \"as any kind of communication in speech, writing or behaviour, that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender or other identity factor.\"\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, this new guidance is opposed by the anti-LGBTQIA+ hate groups. At the Political Network for Values Transatlantic Summit in November, ADF\\'s Kao said current hate speech laws protect too many different groups of people and in doing so infringe on religious freedom laws. \"Who can possibly know what would fall under such an expansive definition of hate?\" she said. \"These laws give a veto to any offended person, allowing them to censor their neighbours.\"\\n\\nBeirich strongly disagrees. \"You can\\'t use religion as a foil for harming communities and tearing into their civil and human rights. I don\\'t care,\" she says, adding that the Ku Klux Klan has weaponised religion as a means to discriminate against Black people since it was founded in 1865.\\n\\n\"It\\'s one thing to live your life however you want to live it biblically inspired. It\\'s a different thing to have that affect other people,\" says Beirich. \"Keep your views to yourself.\"\\n\\nAs these groups continue to operate inside the UN, what can be done? Datta says NGOs applying for Special Consultative Status should be subject to more rigorous background checks, where an independent body thoroughly examines the track record of applicants.\\n\\n\"What are the positions...of these organisations and what have they actually done?\" says Datta. \"What other things have they done which could be seen as having undermined human rights -- the UN\\'s Declaration of Human Rights?\"\\n\\nHe says using an independent body for this review would reduce the potential of political influences in the decision-making process.\\n\\nAs for those who already have Special Consultative Status, their status can be revoked if they don\\'t \"conform at all times to the principles governing the establishment.\"\\n\\nBeirich feels strongly that should happen swiftly for all six anti-LGBTQIA+ groups that currently hold this status. \"The United Nations should revoke the consultative status of people who stand opposed to the Universal Declaration. It shouldn\\'t stand for policies that are rolling back human rights -- it\\'s absurd.\"'}\n",

The said event, scheduled to take place from December 17 to 21, 2024 in Ghaziabad, is being organised by individuals who have a history of making hateful and inflammatory speeches against the Muslim community. The petition highlights that these speeches and the event itself promote hatred and could lead to communal violence.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court had earlier directed authorities to take immediate action against such hate speeches and events, even if no formal complaint was made. However, despite clear announcements about the \"Dharam Sansad\" and its harmful content being shared publicly, the authorities have failed to act. This petition calls for the Court to intervene and ensure that the law is enforced, so as to prevent any further spread of hate and violence.\\n\\nNot only through legal means, many religious organisations have also condemned the scheduled event. The Satya Dharam Samvad (SDS), a collective of 62 prominent Hindu Acharyas, has also spoken against the divisive nature of the proposed \"Dharam Sansad,\" calling for its rejection and emphasising the need for unity, tolerance, and interfaith dialogue. In a statement, they expressed concern over the misuse of religion to incite hatred and violence, reaffirming that Hinduism, with its core principles of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family) and Sarva Dharma Sambhava (equal respect for all religions), stands for peace, acceptance, and harmony.\\n\\nSatya Dharam Samvad condemns the \"Dharam Sansad\" and calls for unity\\n\\nThe Satya Dharam Samvad (SDS), an organisation of Hindu Acharyas, has called upon Hindu religious leaders and organisations to reject the divisive \"Dharam Sansad\" proposed by the Yati Narsinghanand Foundation, scheduled to take place from Tuesday to Saturday at the Shiv-Shakti temple complex in Ghaziabad\\'s Dasna. In a joint statement signed by 62 Acharyas, including prominent figures like Swami Raghavendra, Acharya Bajrang, Mahant, Prof. Anantanand Rambachan, Ashok Maharaj Kamble, and Ashok Sangpa, the SDS emphasised the importance of promoting unity, tolerance, and dialogue over hatred and division.\\n\\nThe statement expressed deep concern over the increasing misuse of religion to spread violence and discord, urging a return to the foundational values of Hinduism - Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family) and Sarva Dharma Sambhava (equal respect for all religions). It affirmed that Hinduism has always stood for peace, acceptance, and harmony, rejecting caste-based divisions and any form of oppression. True spirituality, the signatories asserted, lies in recognising the divine presence in all beings and fostering mutual respect.\\n\\nThe SDS also criticised the \"World Religion Convention\" and the provocative speeches targeting specific faiths that are being promoted as part of the upcoming event. These actions, they argued, are a departure from the true essence of Sanatan Dharma, undermining its spiritual sanctity while threatening the harmony of the nation. The statement firmly condemned words or actions that promote hatred, disrespect other religions, or incite violence, calling such behaviour completely at odds with Hindu principles.\\n\\nCalling for interfaith understanding and peaceful coexistence, the SDS urged religious leaders to oppose the exploitation of religion for political or divisive purposes. They also called on the authorities to take accountability and ensure that religion is not misused to fuel division. The signatories appealed for unity, urging Hindus and people of all faiths to come together with kindness and mutual respect, recognising that India\\'s true strength lies in its diversity and shared harmony.\\n\\nBackground: The petition had been filed before the Supreme Court of India under Article 129 of the Constitution, read with Section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. The petition arises from the deliberate and wilful disobedience of two specific orders passed by the Supreme Court: the order dated October 21, 2022 in Shaheen Abdulla v. Union of India & Ors. (W.P. (C) No. 940/2022) and the order dated April 28, 2023 in Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay v. Union of India & Ors. (W.P. (C) No. 943/2021). These orders had directed state authorities to take suo- motu action against hate speech or activities that attract offences under Sections 153A, 153B, 295A, and 505 of the erstwhile Indian Penal Code (IPC), even in the absence of formal complaints. The orders further clarified that any hesitation or delay in complying with these directions would amount to contempt of court.\\n\\nThe petition states that despite these explicit directives, the petition highlights that the authorities in Uttar Pradesh, including the Commissioner of Police, District Magistrate, and Director General of Police, have failed to act against an upcoming event titled \"Dharam Sansad,\" scheduled to take place from December 17 to 21 at Shiv Shakti Dham, Dasna, Ghaziabad. The event, organised by the Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati Foundation, has been widely publicised through a website titled worldreligiousconvention.org. The website and the event itself are rooted in incendiary, communal content that openly propagates hate against the Muslim community, posing a direct threat to constitutional values of secularism and fraternity. The contempt petition seeks immediate judicial intervention to prevent this event and hold the respondents accountable for their failure to comply with the Supreme Court\\'s earlier orders.\\n\\nThe content of the event and its communal nature: The petition brings to the Court\\'s attention the blatantly inflammatory and communal nature of the content being disseminated through the website promoting the \"Dharam Sansad\" event. The petition provides that the mission statement of the event openly declares:\\n\\n\"The World Religious Parliament is a meaningful initiative to warn the whole world about the danger of Islam and it is an effort to bring together every Non-Muslim of all over the countries.\"\\n\\nFurther, the petition also provides the vision statement that outlines an explicit and dangerous agenda:\\n\\n\"Our goal is to free the entire world from Islamic Jihad. This is our specific goal and to achieve this goal, we will take all possible steps.\"\\n\\nIn addition to the website\\'s content, the petition underscores that provocative and hateful language has been used in public speeches made by the event organisers, event as the announcement of the Dharam Sansad was being made. As per the petition, Yati Ramswaroopanand, one of the key figures associated with the event, delivered a speech in Dehradun on September 10, 2024, describing Muslims as \"not human\" and calling for Uttarakhand to be made \"Islam mukt.\" He further urged Hindus to \"keep good weapons and learn how to use them.\" The petition provides supporting material, including transcripts, screenshots, and reports, to substantiate these claims.\\n\\nThe petition emphasises that the dissemination of such incendiary content and the planned congregation of individuals with a documented history of hate speech is not only a violation of Sections 153A, 153B, 295A, and 505 of the IPC but also strikes at the core of India\\'s constitutional values of secularism, harmony, and fraternity.\\n\\nTrack record of violence and state inaction: The contempt petition goes beyond the immediate concern of the \"Dharam Sansad\" and highlights the troubling track record of the individuals involved in organising and promoting the event. Individuals like Yati Narsinghanand and Yati Ramswaroopanand have repeatedly made provocative speeches inciting communal violence. For instance:\\n\\nThe petition highlights that despite a well-documented history of hate speech and communal violence directly linked to these individuals, the state authorities have failed to take preventive action or register FIRs, as mandated by the Supreme Court. This consistent inaction emboldens the organisers and poses an imminent threat to communal harmony in the region.\\n\\nThe petition argues that the respondents\\' failure to act constitutes not just a dereliction of duty but a wilful disobedience of the Supreme Court\\'s orders. By ignoring repeated provocations and open announcements of such events, the state authorities are in clear contempt of court.\\n\\nLegal basis and prayer for relief: The petition places heavy reliance on two recent judgments of the Supreme Court to strengthen its legal argument. In Chaduranga Kanthraj URS v. P. Ravi Kumar (2024), the Court clarified that wilful disobedience -- deliberate and intentional disregard of court orders -- constitutes civil contempt. Similarly, in Celir LLP v. Sumati Prasad Bafna (2024), the Court expanded the scope of contempt, holding that any act intended to undermine the judicial process also falls within its ambit. The petition argues that the respondents\\' failure to prevent the \"Dharam Sansad\" event, despite its provocative and unconstitutional nature, directly undermines the Court\\'s authority and frustrates its earlier orders.\\n\\nThe petition concludes with the following prayers:\\n\\nThe petition emphasises that the Court\\'s intervention is not only necessary to address the specific case of non-compliance but also to reaffirm the rule of law and the constitutional mandate of secularism and fraternity. By allowing such events to proceed unchecked, the respondents are enabling the erosion of these values and endangering communal harmony across the nation. The petition, therefore, calls upon the Court to take strong and decisive action to ensure compliance with its earlier orders and prevent further escalation of hate speech and violence.\\n\\nA detailed report on the widespread opposition that the Dharam Sansad is facing can be read here.\\n\\nFierce backlash grows against Yati Narsinghanand\\'s Dharam Sansad as fears of incitement to violence escalate; plea moved in SC\\n\\nUttarakhand: Retd.

Who make UN policy,\" says Gillian Kane, director of global policy and research at Ipas, a non-governmental organisation that focuses on advancing gender equity and reducing the harm of U.S. foreign policy.\\n\\nKane, who attended the November Summit, says this status \"legitimises these groups\" who have clear track records that conflict with the core principles of the UN, like the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing subtle about what they do. They hate gays and they\\'re unapologetic to go after it,\" says Kane.\\n\\nMany of these groups have been around for decades, advocating against the LGBTQIA+ community. Kao\\'s group, ADF, published a press release titled \"ADF increases global impact with new status at United Nations\" when they were granted consultative status in 2010. \"ADF can now have a say when UN treaties and conventions are drafted that directly impact religious liberty and important matters related to the sanctity of life, marriage, and the family,\" the release said. It goes on to say that \"ADF will now be able to monitor and provide input on matters\" affecting religious freedoms.\\n\\nThe group, which consists of hundreds of lawyers in the U.S. and around the globe, was founded in 1994 by Alan Sears, who co-authored The Homosexual Agenda: Exposing the Principal Threat to Religious Freedom Today. Since then, they have advocated at the state and federal level for laws that promote conversion therapy and that would ban gays from serving in the military. In addition, they\\'ve testified in favour of laws that would strip transgender folks of the right to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity, that would prevent them from changing the name on their birth certificate and that would ban their access to gender affirming healthcare.\\n\\nIn addition, they have been effective globally through their international arm, ADF International. In 2012 in Jamaica, they advocated for the retention of a a law that criminalises gay sex. That law remains in effect. And in 2013, members of ADF worked to defend a Belize statute that makes anyone engaging in LGBTQIA+ sex subject to a punishment of up to 10 years in prison.\\n\\nThe other groups -- which include the Howard Center for Family Religion and Society (now known as International Organization for Family), Family Research Council, the Association of United Families International and the American Family Association of New York -- all have similar track records.\\n\\nSubscribe now\\n\\nFamily Research Council has advocated in favor of conversion therapy laws and continues to publish articles that falsely assert that \"sexual orientation change efforts\" are effective for gay people. And Tim Wildmon, the President of the American Family Association, is currently advocating for a boycott of Target for allowing trans people to use the bathroom or dressing room that matches their gender identity.\\n\\n\"Please use #BoycottTarget,\" Wildmon wrote in a special update on their website.\\n\\nBecause of these track records, Beirich felt it was \"a no brainer\" to add them to the SPLC\\'s list of hate groups alongside the Ku Klux Klan, the American Defense Skinheads and Aryan Nations.\\n\\n\"We put them on the hate list because they demonise the entire LGBTQIA+ population in derogatory, dehumanising language, just like the Klan would with Black people or Jewish people,\" says Beirich, now the co-founder and chief strategy officer at the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.\\n\\n\"People in the Christian right who have long demonised the LGBTQIA+ community have political power in this country, and it\\'s more normalised to hate queer people than to hate Black people for no damn good reason. Which is what we\\'re talking about. So it\\'s the biblically informed aspect of it that somehow legitimises it,\" says Beirich, who adds that she has \"absolutely no idea\" how these groups secured this status.\\n\\nSo how do these groups get here? While they all conform to basic principles required for Special Consultative Status, such as being a registered nonprofit and having specialised expertise on issues relevant to the UN, they are also expected to act in conformity with \"the spirit, purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,\" which specifically states that members must promote and encourage respect for human rights, take action \"to strengthen universal peace\" and -- specifically for members with consultative status -- must promote policies that encourage \"social progress.\"\\n\\nNeil Datta, the executive director for the European Parliamentary Forum for Sexual and Reproductive Rights, says part of the reason these groups are granted this status is due to overworked civil servants who work for the NGO Branch of the UN and are in charge of a preliminary screening of these applicants.\\n\\n\"The folks reviewing these applications are not necessarily thematic experts on anything. So they\\'re tasked with a very dry job of processing different applications that come in, and very legitimately won\\'t know what all of these different groups are,\" he says. \"Imagine you had 15 climate groups applying and one didn\\'t believe in climate change. It\\'s not necessarily that easy to understand.\"\\n\\nDatta says it can be even harder to identify anti-LGBTQIA+ groups because they often operate under the guise of protecting the family or the rights of the child.\\n\\n\"These groups have very nice names that aren\\'t obviously anti-LGBTQIA+. And so the people reviewing these applications may not be able to pick up on some of the subtleties,\" he says.\\n\\nIn addition, Datta says these groups use \"very clever vocabulary\" that sounds well meaning. But really, they are weaponising this language to penetrate powerful institutions like the UN \"In reality, they\\'re using religious freedom as a fig leaf for hate speech.\"\\n\\n\"But if you know your Catholic social doctrine, then you will recognise [this vocabulary] immediately.\" Datta says common dog whistles such as \"common good\" or \"human dignity\" and \"in favour of life [or] of the family\" are used almost exclusively to limit the human rights of others, \"usually in sexuality and reproduction.\"\\n\\nDatta says these \"codewords\" are another reason these groups go unnoticed within the UN. For example, during a three hour meeting at the November Transatlantic Summit event, participants used the term \"human dignity\" over 30 times.\\n\\nAfter they get through the preliminary screening by UN civil servants, their application is reviewed by the NGO Committee -- which meets twice a year -- to decide who they will recommend for Special Consultative Status. After review, the recommended organisations are presented to ECOSOC for their final decision.\\n\\nThis committee includes 19 countries, including multiple countries that have extremely hostile policies against LGBTQIA+ people, like Algeria, where homosexual activity is punishable by up to two years in prison; and Eritrea, where homosexuality is illegal and can be punished with jail-time.\\n\\n\"It honestly depends on who\\'s sitting on that committee. So if you have countries that already have anti-LGBTQIA+ policies in place, they\\'re going to be friendly to inviting these groups in and approving their status,\" says Kane.\\n\\nOnce these groups officially gain this status, they use religious freedom as a justification for promoting policies and laws that limit the rights of LGBTQIA+ people through the UN apparatus.\\n\\nThe UN Declaration of Human Rights does not yet explicitly protect folks who are discriminated against for their sexual orientation or gender identity. This lack of protection has given anti-LGBTQIA+ groups leverage in their arguments to roll back the rights of LGBTQIA+ folks.\\n\\nInside the UN, there are efforts to change this. For example, in 2019 the Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect published a Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech that outlines what constitutes hate speech and how to combat it. In it, they describe hate speech \"as any kind of communication in speech, writing or behaviour, that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender or other identity factor.\"\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, this new guidance is opposed by the anti-LGBTQIA+ hate groups. At the Political Network for Values Transatlantic Summit in November, ADF\\'s Kao said current hate speech laws protect too many different groups of people and in doing so infringe on religious freedom laws. \"Who can possibly know what would fall under such an expansive definition of hate?\" she said. \"These laws give a veto to any offended person, allowing them to censor their neighbours.\"\\n\\nBeirich strongly disagrees. \"You can\\'t use religion as a foil for harming communities and tearing into their civil and human rights. I don\\'t care,\" she says, adding that the Ku Klux Klan has weaponised religion as a means to discriminate against Black people since it was founded in 1865.\\n\\n\"It\\'s one thing to live your life however you want to live it biblically inspired. It\\'s a different thing to have that affect other people,\" says Beirich. \"Keep your views to yourself.\"\\n\\nAs these groups continue to operate inside the UN, what can be done? Datta says NGOs applying for Special Consultative Status should be subject to more rigorous background checks, where an independent body thoroughly examines the track record of applicants.\\n\\n\"What are the positions...of these organisations and what have they actually done?\" says Datta. \"What other things have they done which could be seen as having undermined human rights -- the UN\\'s Declaration of Human Rights?\"\\n\\nHe says using an independent body for this review would reduce the potential of political influences in the decision-making process.\\n\\nAs for those who already have Special Consultative Status, their status can be revoked if they don\\'t \"conform at all times to the principles governing the establishment.\"\\n\\nBeirich feels strongly that should happen swiftly for all six anti-LGBTQIA+ groups that currently hold this status. \"The United Nations should revoke the consultative status of people who stand opposed to the Universal Declaration. It shouldn\\'t stand for policies that are rolling back human rights -- it\\'s absurd.\"'}\n",

Although his call was made during Islamophobia Awareness Month and in a context of higher rates of anti-Muslim hate than at any other point in recent history, the MP for Birmingham Hall Green and Moseley's call for legal protection of specifically religious symbols and values has resulted in concerns about potential implications for free speech and the proper role of the state in regulating expressions of religious dissent and religious dissidence. Though Humanists UK has attained assurances from the government that there are no plans to reintroduce blasphemy laws or restrict free expression around religion, this episode -- not to mention the current Prime Minister's characteristically lacklustre response to Ali in Parliament -- raises a question: how are we to combat the aggressive rise of anti-Muslim hate, egregious examples of which were abundantly displayed during this August's riots, without compromising upon secularist commitments to the defence of freedom of conscience and expression?\\n\\nMany among this publication's readership may also be aware that this year marked 300 years since the birth in Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) of Immanuel Kant -- one of the greatest and most influential philosophers in history. Anniversaries such as these are apt to prompt reflection upon the legacy of a pioneering thinker and comparisons between their times and our own. They invite us to ask whether we still have anything to learn from so historically distant a figure as Kant. A leading champion of the Aufklärung -- Germany's contribution to the Age of Enlightenment -- Kant took pride in the spirit of free inquiry which he saw as the defining trait of his historical period, arguing for academic freedom and against censorship of the press.\\n\\n'Ours is the age of criticism, to which everything must submit', he wrote in The Critique of Pure Reason, meaning by 'criticism' not the vitriolic name-calling and unsubstantiated accusations characteristic of certain billionaire-owned social media platforms and associated political opportunists, but the patient and disciplined process of understanding through rational scrutiny. From this sustained project of questioning, challenging, and evaluating, Kant maintains, nothing is exempt -- not even the doctrines of a religion or the legislation of a state.\\n\\nTo return to certain legislative proposals recently mooted in Parliament, and although etymology is an unsure guide to the current meaning or use of a word, it is perhaps worthy of note that the origins of the term 'desecration' lie with the act of divesting something of an allegedly sacred status, and hence of removing that thing from an elevated position which commands respect or even reverence. With this in mind, accusations of desecration are premised upon the assumption that whatever is alleged to have been 'desecrated' is unlike ordinary things -- which is to say that it is in a class apart, meriting special treatment and attitudes of veneration. If that is the case, however, then refusal to consent to the allegedly privileged status of that thing, and to regulate one's actions, attitudes, and expressions accordingly, is to be as guilty of desecration as if one scuffed a Quran.\\n\\nAs such, legislation against desecration may be expected to raise concerns amongst those of us who believe that it is for the individual conscience to decide what should be valued in this privileged manner, rather than for the state and its legislative and juridical representatives, or, indeed, the followers and advocates of one or another set of religious doctrines, values, and practices. For the state to enforce respect for the purportedly 'sacred' status of certain symbols and institutions, religious or otherwise -- although the harsh policing of republican protests at last year's coronation suggests that caution is advised in offering the monarchy as an example here -- seems, at the very least, to mark a worrying departure from the ideal of open-minded critical inquiry in which Kant invites us to participate.\\n\\nThough justly confident of having secured his place in philosophical history, Kant lived in a manner which gave evidently little consideration to his later biographers -- of whom there have been understandably few given his life of near tragi-comic uneventfulness. Never in his life did he set foot more than 30 miles from his hometown, and it is said that fellow Königsbergers would set their clocks by the regularity of his walks -- a daily occurrence from which only news of the outbreak of the French Revolution ever once led him to depart.\\n\\nDuring a life otherwise exasperatingly unmarked by dramatic incident, however, one episode merits attention. In October 1794, Kant received a royal correspondence from the state censor expressing extreme displeasure at certain writings in which he was alleged to have 'misused' his philosophy 'to distort and negatively evaluate many of the cardinal and basic teachings of the Holy Scripture and of Christianity'. In order to avoid His Majesty's 'highest disfavour', Kant had to 'give at once a most conscientious account' of himself. Failure to mend his ways, he was told, must be expected to result in 'unpleasant measures' for his 'continued obstinacy.'\\n\\nThe prompt for this act of state intervention was the recent publication of Kant's Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason, an effort to assess which kinds of religious doctrine and organization might meet with our unprejudiced rational approval. Kant had already experienced obstacles from the state censor in publishing parts of this work and told friends that he expected it to result in the loss of his position at the University of Königsberg. Whatever today's audiences might make of his attempts to give a secular interpretation and defence of such dogmas as original sin and divine grace, and whatever Kant's true views about the validity of religion and the existence of God, many of Kant's contemporaries (the King of Prussia included) were struck by the temerity of his refusal to excuse received scriptural wisdom or ecclesiastical authority from the same critical standards he had employed elsewhere in his studies.\\n\\nEspecially concerning for Kant's more orthodox religious critics was his insistence that the doctrines and practices of any religion should answer to a secular morality of human dignity and freedom which affords no role to divine commandments. So uncompromising was Kant, in fact, in his suspicions of familiar arguments for divinely sanctioned ethics (and, indeed, for the very existence of God) that he earned the enviable title of der Allzermalmende (the All-Destroyer). Contemporary freethinkers and darkwave musicians will undoubtedly be disappointed to learn that this title is already taken.\\n\\nKant must have given either a persuasive or a carefully worded account of himself (or both) in his reply to His Majesty's demand. While he had prepared himself for immediate dismissal, Kant ultimately kept his position -- whereas Wöllner, the author of the royal correspondence in question, came satisfyingly close to losing his own. The apparent audacity of Kant's dealings with state and religious establishments might also remind us that he coined for his age of criticism and enlightenment the motto Sapere aude (dare to know). Enlightenment, Kant tells us, is the liberation of humankind from its 'self-imposed immaturity.' The German term Unmündigkeit, which standardly gets translated here as 'immaturity', can also mean 'tutelage' or 'minority' and implies a sheepish deference to authority. Since Mund means 'mouth', one who is unmündig is somehow presumed unqualified to speak on their own behalf. According to Kant, however, it is precisely in our capacity to reach our own conclusions and come to a free and rational decision about which values to uphold and how to direct our lives that our dignity as human beings consists.\\n\\nBetween the alleged dignity of a religious text or symbol, then, and that of the human conscience, there is simply no contest according to Kant. To demand respect for the former is thereby to deny it to the latter. At the same time, however, it is an impermissible affront to the dignity of a person to target them and deny their humanity simply for exercising their inalienable right to decide upon their religious values or rejection thereof.\\n\\nOpponents of recent proposals for anti-desecration legislation may therefore find an ally in Kant. Prejudice against religious minorities should be addressed not by insulating texts and symbols from criticism but by championing the humanity and dignity of every citizen, irrespective of their religious affiliation or lack thereof. Respect for our common humanity entails, however, that it is left to each of us to decide what, if anything, we are to treat as sacred, without the threat of reprisal either from the state or from misinformation-fuelled stooges of one or another reactionary and dehumanising agenda.\\n\\nThe featured image for this article (at the top) is a photo of Salwan Momika burning a Quran in 2023.

Neither makes sense without the other; this intertwining is a major thread in the human story.\\n\\nAt the moment, Britain is facing a very significant and imminent threat as these two spheres of activity combine once more. The new Labour government, according to all reliable political sources, was until recently planning to adopt and enshrine in the criminal law a definition of 'Islamophobia' which is intended to penalize 'hate speech' and extend to an unwonted degree the increasing shackles on free speech so characteristic of intolerant wokery.\\n\\nThe proposed definition would have drawn heavily upon, if not duplicated exactly, that of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on British Muslims. The APPG defines Islamophobia as 'rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness.'\\n\\nThankfully, the government seems to be backtracking. The faith minister, Wajid Khan, has signalled as much by saying that the APPG definition 'is not in line with the Equality Act 2010'. Still, Khan also stated that 'tackling religious hatred' was a priority for the government and that defining 'Islamophobia' is an important part of that. So, a watered-down version might be on the horizon. This is still very worrying, and a vigorous and urgent response to this threat is a pressing matter.\\n\\nThis response must involve a clear statement of the objections to anything like the APPG formula. First, it is ludicrously vague and impractical. We are all aware of the by now many absurd cases in which police officers have interrogated 'suspects' who have posted 'offensive' things online.\\n\\nSecondly, it will create a climate of anxiety and fear which will deter legitimate criticism of Islam. Is it going to be criminal to refer to Trevor Phillips's 2016 Channel 4 documentary What British Muslims Really Think, which suggested that a significant proportion of British Muslims held views that were at odds with mainstream British society, particularly on issues like homosexuality, gender equality, and integration? For example, more than half (52%) believed that homosexuality should not be legal, 39% agreed that 'wives should always obey their husbands', and 23% supported introducing Sharia law to Britain.\\n\\nPhillips argued that the findings highlighted a level of social segregation and a lack of integration among some Muslim communities in the UK. He used the phrase 'a nation within a nation' to describe the situation, suggesting that many British Muslims were living in parallel societies with values that were distinct from, and even contrary to, those of wider British society.\\n\\nThirdly, the whole concept of 'Islamophobia' is entirely spurious. I do not wish to needlessly duplicate the conclusive dismissal given to this term by the likes of Douglas Murray, Sam Harris, and Christopher Hitchens. Suffice it to say that the introduction of the word is a brilliant, and successful, propaganda coup. By this act of lexical legerdemain, which reminds us of the similar term 'homophobia', the plight of Muslims as an oppressed group is compared to the plight of gays and other persecuted minorities. The strategy is all the more offensive in that Islam is fanatically opposed to homosexuality.\\n\\nThe legal definition of 'Islamophobia', whether it draws on the APPG definition or not, will almost certainly have as its central component the claim that 'Islamophobia' is a form of racism. This claim -- entirely and obviously, even on its face, false -- is made nowadays as a matter of routine and, weirdly, it is rarely challenged (quite recently, to give one example, I have heard Baroness Warsi repeat it with assurance).\\n\\nThe claim is the work of tireless operators in the field of 'anti-racism'. By 'anti-racism', I mean that activity undertaken by journalists and politicians of heresy-hunting for and show-trial-like denunciations of anything deemed to have fallen afoul of a woke orthodoxy which reifies contested theories of race and racism into unchallengeable truth. (This activity, not so coincidentally, is a sure way of gaining political power, journalistic prestige, and wealth.) I do not mean genuine opponents of racism. Some examples of this type of 'anti-racist' include David Lammy and Chris Bryant in the House of Commons and Jonathan Freedland and Owen Jones at The Guardian ('the loathsome Owen Jones', according to George Galloway). They all repeat the assertion that 'Islamophobia' is racism without ever deigning to offer any evidence. It is supposed to be self-evident.\\n\\nI would like to explore in more detail just how this linkage came about. The more intellectual YouTube podcasters seem nearly unanimous in blaming it on the malign effects of postmodernism. Although this probably played a role, I believe there is a more obvious explanation.\\n\\nAround half a century ago, I could be found marching through the London streets demonstrating against apartheid; against violence against women; in favour of gay rights. Almost all of my fellow protestors were anti-racist and anti-Islam (and indeed anti-monotheism in general). We hated discrimination and we hated religion. We saw that the two were connected. What was apartheid but the creation of the Dutch Reformed Church? What was sexism but a product of misogynistic preachments from the godly? What was monotheism but the sole theoretical underpinning of homophobia?\\n\\nFast forward to the present, and the anti-religious progressives of the '70s and '80s are now grovelling at the feet of the mullahs. How and why did this complete reversal occur?\\n\\nThere was a point in British political history -- difficult to pinpoint but around 1985 -- when the central narrative of the left, the class struggle, began to lose its persuasive power. Skilled workers were taking holidays on exotic beaches, driving expensive cars, and earning more than junior doctors. They no longer felt like an underclass. Gradually the left replaced the old meta-narrative with a new one: racism. It caught on and the left became obsessive. Political allegiance was now defined in terms of attitudes to race. More and more aspects of life previously considered uncontroversial -- what you ate, where you took holidays, how you wore your hair -- became political. Ludicrous doctrines emerged, for example that white people sporting dreadlocks were guilty of 'cultural appropriation' which, of course, was viewed as 'racist'.\\n\\nConsider the ludicrous case of Amber Rudd and David Lammy. In March 2019, during an interview on BBC Radio 2, Amber Rudd, then a member of the Cabinet, was discussing the challenges faced by women in politics, specifically black and minority ethnic women. She referred to then-shadow home secretary Diane Abbott as 'coloured'. This was certainly awkward. At the very worst, Rudd was culpably ignorant of current practice. Certainly, there was no deliberate offence. But Rudd was piled on for this small misstep (made in the context of lamenting misogyny and racism!).\\n\\nMuslims are a minority, many of them immigrants or descended from recent immigrants, and for these reasons, they historically vote Labour (this pattern, interestingly, might be breaking; in the recent election, some Muslims stood against Labour due to Labour's prevarication on the Israel-Palestine issue -- and George Galloway, incidentally, leapt on this for his own political benefit). The left wished to consolidate its political support amongst this group, and as Muslims were subject to hostility by certain sectors of the British public, the left correctly felt that defending them would be an electoral gain. So they were faced with the choice of defending Muslims on the grounds of race, or those of religion, the two supposed reasons for anti-Muslim sentiment.\\n\\nHere, an obvious contradiction occurs. The left wanted to support LGBT and women's rights and secular values, but it also wanted to support a group containing many members who were antithetical to these values. The resolution of this conflict was simply to pretend that all hostility to the Muslim religion was not really what it seemed, but racism instead. It was a blatant and sinister Orwellian deception. Now, if you were critical of Islam or Muslims, you were simply reassigned to the racist camp. And like all propaganda, the more often this idea was repeated, the more it became rooted in the soil.\\n\\nAnd now we have the poisonous fruit: a government which is prepared to label all those hostile to the religious dogmas and practices of Islam as 'racist', in defiance of all logic and common sense, and to do so for electoral support and because of a cowardly intellectual capitulation to a corrupting zeitgeist.\\n\\nRelated reading\\n\\nCancel culture and religious intolerance: 'Falsely Accused of Islamophobia', by Steven Greer, by Daniel James Sharp\\n\\nBritish Islam and the crisis of 'wokeism' in universities: interview with Steven Greer, by Emma Park\\n\\nConfronting identity politics, a breeding ground for division and dehumanisation, by Maryam Namazie\\n\\nMy punk rock cancellation, by Gerfried Ambrosch\\n\\nThe need to rekindle irreverence for Islam in Muslim thought, by Kunwar Khuldune Shahid\\n\\nFree speech in Britain: a losing battle? by Porcus Sapiens\"}\n",

Some of these actions are designated as \"non-crime hate\" but are still the subject of law enforcement actions. According to the Daily Mail, they now include children who have been pulled in for calling other children schoolyard names like \"retard\" or saying that other children smell \"like fish.\"\\n\\n\"A nine-year-old child is among the youngsters being probed by police over hate incidents... Officers recorded incidents against the child, who called a fellow primary school pupil a \\'retard\\', and against two schoolgirls who said another student smelled \\'like fish.\\' The youngsters were among multiple cases of children being recorded as having committed non-crime hate incidents (NCHIs), The Times discovered through freedom of information requests to police forces.\"\\n\\n\"Non-crime hate\" was introduced in 2014 as part of the Hate Crime Operational Guidelines.\\n\\nIt is chilling in its ambiguity and scope. It only requires the perception of either a victim or a third party that a statement is motivated by hostility or prejudice based on a person\\'s race, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or transgender identity.\\n\\nThe HCOG stresses, \"The victim does not have to justify or provide evidence of their belief, and police officers or staff should not directly challenge this perception. Evidence of the hostility is not required.\"\\n\\nThat guarantees the maximal level of investigation and documentation of speech incidents. The chilling effect on free speech is glacial.\\n\\nFor years, I have been writing about the decline of free speech in the United Kingdom and the steady stream of arrests. A man was convicted for sending a tweet while drunk referring to dead soldiers. Another was arrested for an anti-police t-shirt. Another was arrested for calling the Irish boyfriend of his ex-girlfriend a \"leprechaun.\" Yet another was arrested for singing \"Kung Fu Fighting.\" A teenager was arrested for protesting outside of a Scientology center with a sign calling the religion a \"cult.\"Last year, Nicholas Brock, 52, was convicted of a thought crime in Maidenhead, Berkshire. The neo-Nazi was given a four-year sentence for what the court called his \"toxic ideology\" based on the contents of the home he shared with his mother in Maidenhead, Berkshire.\\n\\nWhile most of us find Brock\\'s views repellent and hateful, they were confined to his head and his room. Yet, Judge Peter Lodder QC dismissed free speech or free thought concerns with a truly Orwellian statement:\\n\\n\"I do not sentence you for your political views, but the extremity of those views informs the assessment of dangerousness.\"\\n\\nLodder lambasted Brock for holding Nazi and other hateful values:\\n\\n\"[i]t is clear that you are a right-wing extremist, your enthusiasm for this repulsive and toxic ideology is demonstrated by the graphic and racist iconography which you have studied and appeared to share with others...\"\\n\\nEven though Lodder agreed that the defendant was older, had limited mobility, and \"there was no evidence of disseminating to others,\" he still sent him to prison for holding extremist views.\\n\\nAfter the sentencing, Detective Chief Superintendent Kath Barnes, Head of Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE), warned others that he was going to prison because he \"showed a clear right-wing ideology with the evidence seized from his possessions during the investigation....We are committed to tackling all forms of toxic ideology which has the potential to threaten public safety and security.\"\\n\\nGreat Britain is now turning, it appears, to their children in speech crackdowns. Schoolyard taunts can be investigated by officers. The impact on both parents and children will obviously be immense. It adds a coercive element to speech laws. Given the subjective and vague standard, the response is to self-censor to avoid any such accusations. Raising children in such an environment will only erode free speech values. Indeed, it fosters the type of speech-phobic generation that many activists may welcome. Speech is viewed as dangerous and subject to continual monitoring by the state.\\n\\nStopping some kid from using a playground taunt will do little to instill mutual respect, but it will instill fear over how the state may respond to your words. It is a lesson that many in the free speech community may relish but one that most citizens should reject. \"Non-crime hate\" investigations are meant to maintain a constant sense of oversight and monitoring of speech, even with our children.\\n\\nJonathan Turley is the Shapiro professor of public interest law at George Washington University and the author of \"The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage.\"'}\n",

Franklin Graham had created a post and I re-posted with some additions for emphasis.\"\\n\\n\"The post thread contained Bible references and explanations from a minister\\'s perspective,\" the ordained minister added.\\n\\nThe Staunton, Virginia realtor posted the scriptures before the U.S. Supreme Court voted 5-4 to redefine marriage. He also posted it before NAR amended its ethics code in 2020 requiring realtors to avoid \"harassing speech, hate speech, epithets, or slurs based on race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity.\"\\n\\nThe minister told the outlet he did not receive any complaints about his comments until last year when he decided to run for Staunton City Council.\\n\\nAt that time, an opposition group criticized Fauber for his Christian beliefs calling him \"The Hater.\"\\n\\n\"There were those who don\\'t like freedom of speech and freedom of religion and so they researched my Facebook accounts and found the post from 2015 and then a local reporter met with me to ask me if I still believed in the scripture I had posted,\" Fauber said.\\n\\nFauber told the reporter he does believe in scripture and what he posted.\\n\\nAs a result, an ethics complaint was filed with the NAR following Fauber\\'s statement. The complaint also cited a recent post from the minister pointing out how female athletes were being physically injured by transgender athletes who were born biologically male.\\n\\nThey concluded that Fauber\\'s statements may have violated the NAR\\'s rules against hate speech, the FFLC explains.\\n\\n\"Apparently quoting the truth of the Bible is now enough to trigger a formal ethics hearing that could ruin a real estate agent\\'s career. In reality, \\'hate speech\\' is nothing more than an Orwellian device used to silence others. Ironically, rules and regulations like these are put in place to hate and harm individuals with disfavored viewpoints,\" reads a statement from the group.\\n\\nFauber is being required to defend his statements in an ethics hearing on December 4 to avoid monetary penalties or lose his membership to the organization, which means after 44 years as a realtor he would be barred from accessing the multiple listing service (MLS).\\n\\n\"It\\'s pretty much impossible to do the real estate business without the MLS,\" Fauber said. \"The MLS does more than allow a realtor to find a property, it includes when it\\'s sold, how many days it\\'s been on the market, and other information, documents, and restrictions.\"\\n\\nVictoria Cobb, president of the Family Foundation of Virginia, oversees FFLC and says the board\\'s action to possibly charge Fauber is concerning.\\n\\n\"When somebody brought him up on ethics charges, the board could have chosen to dismiss them, but they did not,\" Cobb said. \"We\\'re really in a situation where if someone\\'s personal faith posted on their personal Facebook speech becomes hate speech in the minds of an employer or an association, we don\\'t live in a free America, everyone should be concerned about that.\"\\n\\nMichael Sylvester, FFLC litigation counsel, says that if Fauber is dismissed then \"society has really reached a new low.\"\\n\\n\"The hopeful outcome is that the ethics judges will recognize that Wilson hasn\\'t violated the rule and has never spoken against anybody in any online space or publicly,\" Sylvester told The Federalist. \"In the bigger picture, if quoting the Bible is hate speech then society has really reached a new low. Usually, we admire our professionals, but now we are telling our professionals they need to leave their values at the door. One would have thought that this 2020 rule would be to stop society\\'s greatest evil, but now it is targeting Christian ministers.\"\\n\\n\"If this can happen to Wilson it can happen to anyone and if we don\\'t stand up alongside, we may not have anyone stand with us when it happens to us,\" Sylvester said.'}\n",

The strategy, which emphasizes a multi-year approach, underscores the critical need for a united societal effort to combat this deeply entrenched issue. According to a recently published report in The Jerusalem Post, this ambitious plan is being coordinated by the Ministry of Justice and Security, with the National Coordinator for Combating Anti-Semitism Unit playing a pivotal advisory and implementation role. The cabinet has committed to annual reviews of the strategy\\'s efficacy, ensuring adaptability and the potential for enhanced measures as necessary.\\n\\nThe report in The Jerusalem Post highlighted the Dutch government\\'s statement which emphasized the collective responsibility of all citizens in addressing anti-Semitism and ensuring the security of Jewish individuals. \"With the current strategy, the government makes it clear that the fight against anti-Semitism concerns all Dutch people,\" the statement declares. The government\\'s vision for the Netherlands as an \"open, reasonable, and tolerant society\" positions Jewish life as an integral and celebrated part of the national identity. To support this endeavor, the government has allocated €4.5 million, signaling a substantial commitment to the initiative.\\n\\nThe urgency of this strategy is evident in the cabinet\\'s acknowledgment of the Dutch Jewish community\\'s precarious circumstances. As per the information provided in The Jerusalem Post report, the community -- numbering approximately 50,000 individuals, or 0.3% of the total population -- \"lives in great insecurity\" and experiences limitations on their freedom. This grim reality necessitates immediate and sustained action, prompting the establishment of a dedicated task force under the Justice and Security Ministry\\'s leadership. The task force will remain operational for at least a year, focusing on critical areas such as combating anti-Semitism in universities and barring anti-Semitic speakers from educational institutions.\\n\\nThe task force is a collaborative effort, comprising representatives from various ministries, local governments, educational institutions, sports organizations, cultural entities, public transportation sectors, and other societal stakeholders. As reported by The Jerusalem Post, representatives from the Jewish community will also play an essential role in this initiative, ensuring that the community\\'s unique perspectives and needs are adequately addressed.\\n\\nThe strategy itself is anchored on three foundational pillars: \"protect, monitor, and follow-up;\" \"education and prevention;\" and \"commemoration and celebration.\" The Jerusalem Post report elaborated that the first pillar focuses on safeguarding Jewish institutions, holding perpetrators accountable, and providing robust support for victims. This approach is intended to establish a secure environment for Jewish communities while ensuring that acts of anti-Semitism face unequivocal repercussions.\\n\\nEducation and prevention form the second pillar, which aims to dismantle the underlying breeding grounds of anti-Semitism. According to the information contained in The Jerusalem Post report, this includes initiatives to combat anti-Semitism in sports, a sector often overlooked in discussions about prejudice and discrimination. By addressing these root causes, the government seeks to foster a more inclusive and respectful societal framework.\\n\\nThe third pillar, commemoration and celebration, seeks to honor and preserve Jewish heritage in the Netherlands. Indicated in The Jerusalem Post report was that this involves promoting awareness of Jewish history and culture while celebrating the contributions of Jewish life to Dutch society. Through these efforts, the government aims to ensure that Jewish memory remains a vibrant and integral part of the national narrative.\\n\\nOne of the cornerstone issues addressed in the strategy is the significant underreporting of anti-Semitic incidents. According to The Jerusalem Post report, a 2018 EU report revealed that 74% of Dutch Jews who experience anti-Semitism do not report the incidents to anyone, with the rate only slightly better (52%) in cases of violent anti-Semitism. This widespread reluctance to report highlights a systemic problem, one that the government aims to tackle by fostering an environment where victims feel confident that their reports will lead to meaningful action.\\n\\n\"By reporting incidents as standard, more incidents can be followed up, but there is also better insight into where anti-Semitism occurs and where it comes from,\" the strategy states, according to The Jerusalem Post report. To support this effort, the government plans to set up a \"Safety Fund,\" which will provide financial assistance to Jewish institutions for their security systems. This initiative seeks to alleviate the disproportionate financial burden these institutions currently face in safeguarding their communities.\\n\\nIn their extensive report, The Jerusalem Post further detailed that the government is revising the existing reporting mechanisms involving municipal anti-discrimination facilities (ADVs). These updates aim to ensure that victims of anti-Semitism can report incidents with greater confidence and ease. Recognizing that many victims currently turn to the Center for Information and Documentation Israel (CIDI) rather than local centers, the strategy includes a plan to liaise with CIDI and establish robust protocols for sharing information, thereby streamlining the reporting process and enhancing data collection.\\n\\nAnother critical element of this pillar is the provision of aftercare for victims. The report in The Jerusalem Post noted that the government has allocated a specific budget for this purpose, underlining its commitment to addressing the psychological and social impacts of anti-Semitic incidents. Additionally, the justice minister has called for an official investigation into the \"bottlenecks\" that victims encounter when reporting anti-Semitism. Scheduled to begin in 2025, the objective of this investigation is to identify obstacles and use the findings to inform new, more effective measures.\\n\\nLegislative action also features prominently in the strategy. The Jerusalem Post also reported that the cabinet has proposed a bill to increase the maximum prison sentence for anti-Semitic offenses by one-third. This measure calls attention to the government\\'s commitment to imposing harsher penalties on those who perpetrate hate crimes, signaling a strong deterrent to potential offenders.\\n\\nAddressing the growing prevalence of online anti-Semitism, the task force will conduct an annual study into anti-Semitic content on Dutch-language platforms. As detailed in The Jerusalem Post report, this initiative is part of a broader effort to gain deeper insights into the nature and scale of digital anti-Semitism, enabling the government to adapt its policies to the evolving landscape of hate speech.\\n\\nIn a robust push against rising anti-Semitism, European nations are spearheading legal, educational, and digital initiatives, as detailed by The Jerusalem Post. Public prosecutors from 15 European countries convened recently to share insights on addressing anti-Semitism within their criminal justice systems. This meeting, described by The Jerusalem Post as \"successful,\" highlighted the increasing importance of international collaboration in combating hate speech and discrimination.\\n\\nAs reported by The Jerusalem Post, the Netherlands enacted a new law on October 1 criminalizing all forms of Holocaust denial. This move reflects a growing recognition of the need to counteract denialism and misinformation, aligning with broader European efforts to address historical distortion.\\n\\nEducation emerges as a cornerstone in the fight against anti-Semitism, according to The Jerusalem Post. A key focus of the second pillar in Europe\\'s strategy is addressing the \"breeding grounds\" of anti-Semitism, particularly conspiracy theories and online hate speech. A 2022 study cited by The Jerusalem Post revealed that out of 200,395 instances of online anti-Semitism, over 11% explicitly targeted Judaism. Tackling this surge requires fostering awareness and understanding through education.\\n\\nIn the Netherlands, this educational focus manifests through initiatives such as enhanced citizenship education, which plays a pivotal role in addressing anti-Semitism and broader discrimination. The Jerusalem Post report highlighted the Dutch government\\'s acknowledgment of the alarming decline in Holocaust awareness among its population, prompting a four-year educational scheme to reinvigorate Holocaust education and share forgotten stories of World War II. Starting in January, the \"Learn about the Holocaust\" campaign will lay the groundwork for these efforts.\\n\\nIn addition to school-based initiatives, new measures will require immigrants to demonstrate knowledge of the Holocaust and answer questions about anti-Semitism to pass integration exams beginning July 1, 2025, according to The Jerusalem Post. These policies aim to ensure that newcomers are equipped with an understanding of historical and cultural contexts, reinforcing societal commitments to combating hate.\\n\\nThe plan also includes a National Plan for Strengthening Holocaust Education, with progress updates scheduled for the Dutch House of Representatives in fall 2025. As reported by The Jerusalem Post, this holistic approach reflects a commitment to rooting out anti-Semitism through both systemic education and individual accountability.\\n\\nDigital platforms are another critical battleground, with the European Union leveraging the Digital Services Act (DSA) to combat online anti-Semitism. As noted by The Jerusalem Post, the DSA mandates that platforms promptly evaluate and act upon reports of illegal content or face significant fines -- up to 6% of their global turnover. This act enhances transparency by requiring platforms to submit moderation decisions to the European Commission for inclusion in the DSA Transparency Database.\\n\\nFurther bolstering these efforts, the Netherlands\\' National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Security, in collaboration with law enforcement, has developed a \"symbol bank\" to aid professionals in identifying and responding to extremist and anti-Semitic symbols. This initiative ensures that professionals across sectors are equipped to recognize and address hate symbols effectively.\\n\\nIn a novel initiative supported by the Anne Frank Foundation, the KNVB\\'s \"Chanting Project\" seeks to educate fans on the harmful impacts of anti-Semitic chants. As noted in The Jerusalem Post report, fans found guilty of engaging in such behavior may be required to participate in this program, which focuses on fostering awareness among supporters. This educational approach complements the broader strategy\\'s emphasis on reducing the spread of hate through proactive measures.\\n\\nThe third pillar of the strategy focuses on commemoration and celebration, emphasizing the Netherlands\\' responsibility to preserve its Jewish heritage. As The Jerusalem Post report highlighted, the Dutch government acknowledges its \"special historical responsibility\" stemming from its role in World War II. This responsibility includes safeguarding tangible and intangible aspects of Jewish history and ensuring they are passed on to future generations.\\n\\nTo promote Holocaust education and awareness, January will now be designated as Holocaust Education Month. According to The Jerusalem Post, this initiative aims to spotlight the importance of Holocaust education and enhance access to relevant materials and activities, particularly in schools. Additionally, April 25 has been declared the National Day Against Anti-Semitism, a move intended to unify Dutch society in its commitment to combating discrimination.\\n\\nIn a broader effort to respect and celebrate Jewish life, the Dutch government has urged institutions and businesses to consider Jewish and Islamic holidays, the Sabbath, and dietary restrictions. The Jerusalem Post report noted that this aligns with existing practices surrounding other holidays and aims to create a more inclusive environment for religious observance.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science has also made significant strides in preserving Jewish heritage. As reported by The Jerusalem Post, the ministry provides structural subsidies under the Heritage Act to the Jewish Cultural Quarter for public activities and the management of the Jewish Museum\\'s collection. Furthermore, an additional 80 former synagogues and 71 Jewish cemeteries have been designated as national monuments, offering their owners access to financial support for maintenance and ensuring their protection for future generations.\\n\\nThe Public Prosecution Service also registered a significant increase in anti-Semitic offenses, with 181 cases recorded in 2023 compared to 94 in 2022. This alarming rise speaks volumes about a deepening issue that demands immediate attention, as detailed by The Jerusalem Post.\\n\\nWhile Dutch government agencies do not publicly categorize perpetrator groups in anti-Semitic incidents, the most recent Terrorism Threat Assessment in the Netherlands identifies anti-Semitism within left-wing extremism, jihadism, and right-wing extremism. As reported by The Jerusalem Post, these findings reveal that anti-Semitism transcends political and ideological divides, manifesting in various forms across the spectrum of extremism.\\n\\nThe report further highlights the impact of international events, noting that the conflict in Gaza has \"lowered the threshold for radical Islamic individuals who do not adhere to jihadist ideology\" to justify attacks on Jewish or Israeli individuals and institutions. This correlation between geopolitical conflict and domestic anti-Semitic acts adds a complex dimension to the issue, as explained by The Jerusalem Post.\\n\\nA striking finding, highlighted by The Jerusalem Post, is the prevalence of anti-Semitism within the context of soccer. A Panteia research study, commissioned by the Anne Frank Foundation, found that soccer is the most common setting where students insult Jews. These insults often spill over into schools, perpetuating anti-Semitic attitudes among younger generations.\\n\\nThe study also revealed demographic patterns in anti-Semitic expressions. Insults tied to the Middle East conflict predominantly originate from Dutch-Moroccan or Dutch-Turkish students, who were found to hold more negative attitudes toward Jews than their peers of Dutch, Surinamese, or Caribbean Dutch descent. This differentiation underscores the influence of cultural and political contexts on anti-Semitic attitudes, as noted in the report.\\n\\nThe findings detailed by The Jerusalem Post paint a concerning picture of rising anti-Semitism in the Netherlands, driven by a lethal combination of extremist ideologies, geopolitical tensions, and cultural influences. The increase in both reported incidents and violent offenses shines a spotlight on the urgency of addressing this issue through targeted education, stricter enforcement of hate crime laws, and community outreach.\\n\\nThe government\\'s recognition of these diverse sources of anti-Semitism provides a foundation for comprehensive interventions. However, as The Jerusalem Post report emphasized, the complexity of the issue requires nuanced solutions that account for its multifaceted origins, from soccer culture to global conflicts.'}\n",

The said event, scheduled to take place from December 17 to 21, 2024 in Ghaziabad, is being organised by individuals who have a history of making hateful and inflammatory speeches against the Muslim community. The petition highlights that these speeches and the event itself promote hatred and could lead to communal violence.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court had earlier directed authorities to take immediate action against such hate speeches and events, even if no formal complaint was made. However, despite clear announcements about the \"Dharam Sansad\" and its harmful content being shared publicly, the authorities have failed to act. This petition calls for the Court to intervene and ensure that the law is enforced, so as to prevent any further spread of hate and violence.\\n\\nNot only through legal means, many religious organisations have also condemned the scheduled event. The Satya Dharam Samvad (SDS), a collective of 62 prominent Hindu Acharyas, has also spoken against the divisive nature of the proposed \"Dharam Sansad,\" calling for its rejection and emphasising the need for unity, tolerance, and interfaith dialogue. In a statement, they expressed concern over the misuse of religion to incite hatred and violence, reaffirming that Hinduism, with its core principles of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family) and Sarva Dharma Sambhava (equal respect for all religions), stands for peace, acceptance, and harmony.\\n\\nSatya Dharam Samvad condemns the \"Dharam Sansad\" and calls for unity\\n\\nThe Satya Dharam Samvad (SDS), an organisation of Hindu Acharyas, has called upon Hindu religious leaders and organisations to reject the divisive \"Dharam Sansad\" proposed by the Yati Narsinghanand Foundation, scheduled to take place from Tuesday to Saturday at the Shiv-Shakti temple complex in Ghaziabad\\'s Dasna. In a joint statement signed by 62 Acharyas, including prominent figures like Swami Raghavendra, Acharya Bajrang, Mahant, Prof. Anantanand Rambachan, Ashok Maharaj Kamble, and Ashok Sangpa, the SDS emphasised the importance of promoting unity, tolerance, and dialogue over hatred and division.\\n\\nThe statement expressed deep concern over the increasing misuse of religion to spread violence and discord, urging a return to the foundational values of Hinduism - Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family) and Sarva Dharma Sambhava (equal respect for all religions). It affirmed that Hinduism has always stood for peace, acceptance, and harmony, rejecting caste-based divisions and any form of oppression. True spirituality, the signatories asserted, lies in recognising the divine presence in all beings and fostering mutual respect.\\n\\nThe SDS also criticised the \"World Religion Convention\" and the provocative speeches targeting specific faiths that are being promoted as part of the upcoming event. These actions, they argued, are a departure from the true essence of Sanatan Dharma, undermining its spiritual sanctity while threatening the harmony of the nation. The statement firmly condemned words or actions that promote hatred, disrespect other religions, or incite violence, calling such behaviour completely at odds with Hindu principles.\\n\\nCalling for interfaith understanding and peaceful coexistence, the SDS urged religious leaders to oppose the exploitation of religion for political or divisive purposes. They also called on the authorities to take accountability and ensure that religion is not misused to fuel division. The signatories appealed for unity, urging Hindus and people of all faiths to come together with kindness and mutual respect, recognising that India\\'s true strength lies in its diversity and shared harmony.\\n\\nBackground: The petition had been filed before the Supreme Court of India under Article 129 of the Constitution, read with Section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. The petition arises from the deliberate and wilful disobedience of two specific orders passed by the Supreme Court: the order dated October 21, 2022 in Shaheen Abdulla v. Union of India & Ors. (W.P. (C) No. 940/2022) and the order dated April 28, 2023 in Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay v. Union of India & Ors. (W.P. (C) No. 943/2021). These orders had directed state authorities to take suo- motu action against hate speech or activities that attract offences under Sections 153A, 153B, 295A, and 505 of the erstwhile Indian Penal Code (IPC), even in the absence of formal complaints. The orders further clarified that any hesitation or delay in complying with these directions would amount to contempt of court.\\n\\nThe petition states that despite these explicit directives, the petition highlights that the authorities in Uttar Pradesh, including the Commissioner of Police, District Magistrate, and Director General of Police, have failed to act against an upcoming event titled \"Dharam Sansad,\" scheduled to take place from December 17 to 21 at Shiv Shakti Dham, Dasna, Ghaziabad. The event, organised by the Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati Foundation, has been widely publicised through a website titled worldreligiousconvention.org. The website and the event itself are rooted in incendiary, communal content that openly propagates hate against the Muslim community, posing a direct threat to constitutional values of secularism and fraternity. The contempt petition seeks immediate judicial intervention to prevent this event and hold the respondents accountable for their failure to comply with the Supreme Court\\'s earlier orders.\\n\\nThe content of the event and its communal nature: The petition brings to the Court\\'s attention the blatantly inflammatory and communal nature of the content being disseminated through the website promoting the \"Dharam Sansad\" event. The petition provides that the mission statement of the event openly declares:\\n\\n\"The World Religious Parliament is a meaningful initiative to warn the whole world about the danger of Islam and it is an effort to bring together every Non-Muslim of all over the countries.\"\\n\\nFurther, the petition also provides the vision statement that outlines an explicit and dangerous agenda:\\n\\n\"Our goal is to free the entire world from Islamic Jihad. This is our specific goal and to achieve this goal, we will take all possible steps.\"\\n\\nIn addition to the website\\'s content, the petition underscores that provocative and hateful language has been used in public speeches made by the event organisers, event as the announcement of the Dharam Sansad was being made. As per the petition, Yati Ramswaroopanand, one of the key figures associated with the event, delivered a speech in Dehradun on September 10, 2024, describing Muslims as \"not human\" and calling for Uttarakhand to be made \"Islam mukt.\" He further urged Hindus to \"keep good weapons and learn how to use them.\" The petition provides supporting material, including transcripts, screenshots, and reports, to substantiate these claims.\\n\\nThe petition emphasises that the dissemination of such incendiary content and the planned congregation of individuals with a documented history of hate speech is not only a violation of Sections 153A, 153B, 295A, and 505 of the IPC but also strikes at the core of India\\'s constitutional values of secularism, harmony, and fraternity.\\n\\nTrack record of violence and state inaction: The contempt petition goes beyond the immediate concern of the \"Dharam Sansad\" and highlights the troubling track record of the individuals involved in organising and promoting the event. Individuals like Yati Narsinghanand and Yati Ramswaroopanand have repeatedly made provocative speeches inciting communal violence. For instance:\\n\\nThe petition highlights that despite a well-documented history of hate speech and communal violence directly linked to these individuals, the state authorities have failed to take preventive action or register FIRs, as mandated by the Supreme Court. This consistent inaction emboldens the organisers and poses an imminent threat to communal harmony in the region.\\n\\nThe petition argues that the respondents\\' failure to act constitutes not just a dereliction of duty but a wilful disobedience of the Supreme Court\\'s orders. By ignoring repeated provocations and open announcements of such events, the state authorities are in clear contempt of court.\\n\\nLegal basis and prayer for relief: The petition places heavy reliance on two recent judgments of the Supreme Court to strengthen its legal argument. In Chaduranga Kanthraj URS v. P. Ravi Kumar (2024), the Court clarified that wilful disobedience -- deliberate and intentional disregard of court orders -- constitutes civil contempt. Similarly, in Celir LLP v. Sumati Prasad Bafna (2024), the Court expanded the scope of contempt, holding that any act intended to undermine the judicial process also falls within its ambit. The petition argues that the respondents\\' failure to prevent the \"Dharam Sansad\" event, despite its provocative and unconstitutional nature, directly undermines the Court\\'s authority and frustrates its earlier orders.\\n\\nThe petition concludes with the following prayers:\\n\\nThe petition emphasises that the Court\\'s intervention is not only necessary to address the specific case of non-compliance but also to reaffirm the rule of law and the constitutional mandate of secularism and fraternity. By allowing such events to proceed unchecked, the respondents are enabling the erosion of these values and endangering communal harmony across the nation. The petition, therefore, calls upon the Court to take strong and decisive action to ensure compliance with its earlier orders and prevent further escalation of hate speech and violence.\\n\\nA detailed report on the widespread opposition that the Dharam Sansad is facing can be read here.\\n\\nFierce backlash grows against Yati Narsinghanand\\'s Dharam Sansad as fears of incitement to violence escalate; plea moved in SC\\n\\nUttarakhand: Retd.

PM Modi underlined that we are not just a great democratic country but also the creators of democracy.\\n\\nQuoting Rajarshi Purushottam Das Tandon from the constitutional debates, the Prime Minister said: \"It is after centuries, such an eventful meeting is called for, which reminds me of our great past and the earlier times when we were independent and intellectuals used to discuss and deliberate meaningful issues in the sabhas.\"\\n\\nHe then quoted Dr. S.

Recalling that each one of them was from diverse backgrounds, PM Modi emphasised that the thoughtful suggestions given by the women members had a profound impact on the Constitution.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister also expressed pride that suffrage rights were given to women right from the time of independence as compared to many other countries of the world which took decades for the same.\\n\\nHe added that with the same spirit, India during its presidency of the G20 summit put forward the vision of women-led development in front of the world.

However, after independence, due to distorted mentalities or selfishness, the greatest blow was dealt to the core spirit of the nation\\'s unity.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister highlighted that unity in diversity has been India\\'s hallmark and emphasised that we celebrate diversity, and the country\\'s progress lies in celebrating this diversity. However, those with a colonial mindset, who could not see the good in India, and those who believed India was born in 1947, sought contradictions in this diversity.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister remarked that instead of celebrating this invaluable treasure of diversity, efforts were made to sow poisonous seeds within it, aiming to harm the nation\\'s unity.\\n\\nPM Modi urged everyone to make the celebration of diversity an integral part of our lives, and that will be a true tribute to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister highlighted that over the past 10 years, the government\\'s policies have consistently aimed to strengthen the unity of India. He added that Article 370 was an obstacle to the nation\\'s unity and acted as a barrier. PM Modi emphasised that the unity of the country was a priority, in line with the spirit of the Constitution, and hence, Article 370 was abrogated.\\n\\nPM Modi emphasised the need for favourable conditions in India to advance economically and attract global investment. He added that discussions on GST had been ongoing for a long time in the country.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister remarked that GST has played a significant role in economic unity acknowledged the contributions of the previous government and noted that the current government had the opportunity to implement it, advancing the concept of \"One Nation, One Tax\".\\n\\nTouching upon the importance of how ration cards have been a valuable document for the poor in our country and the difficulties encountered by a poor person when he/she moved from one state to another, PM Modi said that they were not entitled to any benefits.\\n\\nHe emphasised that every citizen should have equal rights, regardless of where they are in this vast country and added that to strengthen this sense of unity, the government had reinforced the concept of \"One Nation, One Ration Card\".\\n\\nThe Prime Minister emphasised that providing free healthcare to the poor and common citizens significantly enhances their ability to fight poverty. He highlighted that while healthcare is accessible where they work, it should also be available when they are away and facing life-threatening situations. He remarked that to uphold the principle of national unity, the government introduced the \"One Nation, One Health Card\" initiative through Ayushman Bharat.\\n\\nHe noted that even a person from a remote area of Bihar working in Pune can receive necessary medical services with an Ayushman card.\\n\\nPM Modi highlighted that there were times when one part of the country had electricity while another part was in darkness due to supply issues. He said that during the tenure of the previous governments, India was often criticised globally for its power shortages. The Prime Minister emphasised that to uphold the spirit of the Constitution and the mantra of unity, the government implemented the \"One Nation, One Grid\" initiative. He noted that today, electricity can be seamlessly supplied to every corner of India.\\n\\nTouching upon the infrastructure development in the country, the Prime Minister emphasised that the government is focusing on balanced development to strengthen national unity. He added that whether it is the North East, Jammu and Kashmir, the Himalayan regions, or the desert areas, the government has undertaken efforts to empower infrastructure comprehensively. He noted that this initiative aims to eliminate any sense of distance due to lack of development, thereby fostering unity.\\n\\nEmphasising the digital divide between the \"haves\" and \"have-nots\", PM Modi highlighted that India\\'s success story in Digital India is a source of great pride globally. He added that the democratisation of technology has been a key factor in this success. PM Modi remarked that guided by the vision of the framers of the Constitution, the government has worked to extend optical fibre to every panchayat in India to strengthen national unity.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister said that the Constitution expects unity, and in this spirit, the importance of the mother tongue has been recognised. He noted that suppressing the mother tongue cannot culturally enrich the nation\\'s populace. PM Modi remarked that the New Education Policy has given significant importance to the mother tongue, enabling even the poorest children to become doctors and engineers in their native languages. He added that the Constitution supports everyone and mandates addressing their needs. He highlighted that several classical languages were given their rightful place and respect. He mentioned that the \"Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat\" campaign is strengthening national unity and instilling cultural values in the new generation.\\n\\nHighlighting that the Kashi Tamil Sangamam and Telugu Kashi Sangamam have become significant institutionalised events, PM Modi emphasised that these cultural initiatives strengthen societal bonds. He added that the importance of India\\'s unity is recognised in the core principles of the Constitution, and this should be acknowledged.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister remarked while the Constitution is celebrating its 75th anniversary, milestones like 25, 50, and 60 years also hold significance. Reflecting on history, he said that during the 25th anniversary of the Constitution, it was torn apart in the country. The Prime Minister highlighted that the Emergency was imposed, constitutional arrangements were dismantled, the country was turned into a prison, citizens\\' rights were snatched, and press freedom was locked down.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister said that democracy was strangled, and the sacrifices of the Constitution\\'s framers were attempted to be buried.\\n\\nPM Modi noted that under the leadership of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the nation celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Constitution on November 26, 2000. The Prime Minister said that Atal Bihari Vajpayee, as Prime Minister, delivered a special message to the nation, emphasising the importance of unity, public participation, and partnership. He noted that former PM Vajpayee\\'s efforts were aimed at living the spirit of the Constitution and awakening the public.\\n\\nPrime Minister Modi said that during the 50th anniversary of the Constitution, he had the privilege of becoming the Chief Minister through the constitutional process. He highlighted that during his tenure as Chief Minister, the 60th anniversary of the Constitution was celebrated in Gujarat. He added that for the first time in history, the Constitution was placed in a special arrangement on an elephant, and a Constitution Gaurav Yatra was conducted. PM Modi emphasised that the Constitution holds great significance, and today, as it completes 75 years, he recalled an incident in the Lok Sabha where a senior leader questioned the need for celebrating Constitution Day on November 26, given that January 26 already existed.\\n\\nPM Modi expressed happiness about the special session, noting that it would have been beneficial to discuss the power and diversity of the Constitution, which would have been valuable for the new generation. However, he remarked that everyone had their own constraints, and their own misgivings in various forms, with some revealing their failures. The Prime Minister emphasised that it would have been better if discussions had risen above partisan sentiments and focused on the national interest, which would have enriched the new generation.\\n\\nThe PM expressed special respect for the Constitution, stating that it was the spirit of the Constitution that enabled many people like him to reach where they are today. He highlighted that without any background, it was the power of the Constitution and the blessings of the people that brought them here. PM Modi noted that many individuals in similar situations have reached significant positions because of the Constitution. He added that it is a great fortune that the country has shown immense faith, not just once, but three times. He remarked that this would not have been possible without the Constitution.\\n\\nPM Modi noted that from 1947 to 1952, India did not have an elected government but a temporary, selected one, with no elections held. He highlighted that before 1952, the Rajya Sabha was not formed, and there were no state elections, meaning there was no mandate from the people. He added that despite this, in 1951, without an elected government, an ordinance was issued to amend the Constitution, attacking freedom of expression. The Prime Minister emphasised that this was an insult to the Constitution\\'s framers, as such matters were not addressed in the Constituent Assembly. He remarked that when the opportunity arose, they hammered down on freedom of expression, which was a grave insult to the Constitution\\'s creators. The Prime Minister said that what could not be achieved in the Constituent Assembly was done through the back door by a non-elected Prime Minister, which was a sin.\\n\\nThe PM highlighted that in 1971, a Supreme Court decision was overturned by amending the Constitution, clipping the wings of the judiciary. PM Modi noted that the amendment stated that Parliament could alter any article of the Constitution without judicial review, stripping the courts of their powers. He added that this enabled the then government to curtail fundamental rights and control the judiciary.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister noted that during the Emergency, the Constitution was misused, and democracy was strangled. He emphasised that in 1975, the 39th Amendment was passed, preventing any court from challenging the elections of the President, Vice President, Prime Minister, and Speaker, and this was applied retrospectively to cover past actions.\\n\\nFurther deliberating that during the Emergency, PM Modi noted that people\\'s rights were taken away, thousands were imprisoned, the judiciary was strangled, and press freedom was locked down. He remarked that the idea of a committed judiciary was fully enforced. The Prime Minister noted that Justice H.R. Khanna, who had ruled against the then Prime Minister in a court case, was denied the position of Chief Justice of India despite his seniority. He emphasised that this was a violation of constitutional and democratic processes.\\n\\nRecalling the Supreme Court\\'s judgment in the Shah Bano case provided justice to an Indian woman based on the Constitution\\'s dignity and spirit, PM Modi noted that the Supreme Court granted an elderly woman her rightful due, but then-Prime Minister negated this spirit, sacrificing the Constitution\\'s essence. The Prime Minister remarked that Parliament passed a law to overturn the Supreme Court\\'s decision once again.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister remarked that for the first time in history, the Constitution was deeply wounded.\\n\\nHe added that the framers of the Constitution envisioned an elected government and Prime Minister. However, a non-constitutional entity, the National Advisory Council, which did not take any oath, was placed above the Prime Minister\\'s Office (PMO). The Prime Minister noted that this entity was given an unofficial status above the PMO.\\n\\nPM Modi highlighted that under the Indian Constitution, the people elect the government, and the head of that government forms the Cabinet.\\n\\nRecollecting an incident when a decision made by the Cabinet was torn up in front of journalists by arrogant individuals who disrespected the Constitution, PM Modi said that these individuals habitually played with the Constitution and did not respect it. He added that it was unfortunate that the Cabinet would then change its decision.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister noted that while Article 370 is well-known, very few are aware of Article 35A. He emphasised that Article 35A was imposed without parliamentary approval, which should have been sought. The Prime Minister remarked that the Parliament, the primary guardian of the Constitution, was bypassed, and Article 35A was imposed on the country, leading to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. He highlighted that this was done through a Presidential order, keeping the Parliament in the dark.\\n\\n\\\\PM Modi noted that during Atal Bihari Vajpayee\\'s government, it was decided to build a memorial in Dr. Ambedkar\\'s memory but this work was neither initiated nor allowed for the next 10 years. The Prime Minister emphasised that when his government came to power, out of respect for Dr Ambedkar, they constructed the Dr Ambedkar Memorial on Alipur Road and completed the work.\\n\\nRecollecting that in 1992, during the tenure of former PM Chandra Shekhar, it was decided to establish the Ambedkar International Centre near Janpath in Delhi, PM Modi said this project remained on paper for 40 years and was not executed. He highlighted that it was only in 2015, when his government came to power, that the work was completed. The Prime Minister noted that even the awarding of the Bharat Ratna to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was done a long time later after independence.\\n\\nPM Modi underlined that the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was celebrated globally in 120 countries and during Dr. Ambedkar\\'s birth centenary, a memorial was reconstructed in Mhow, Ambedkar\\'s birthplace.\\n\\nLauding Dr B.R. Ambedkar, a visionary committed to bringing the marginalised sections of society into the mainstream, PM Modi remarked that Dr. Ambedkar believed that for India to develop, no part of the country should remain weak.\\n\\nHe added that this concern led to the establishment of the reservation system. The Prime Minister noted that those engaged in vote bank politics attempted to introduce various measures under the guise of religious appeasement within the reservation system, causing significant harm to the SC, ST, and OBC communities.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister remarked that the previous governments strongly opposed reservations and emphasised that Dr. B.R. Ambedkar introduced reservations for equality and balanced development in India. The Prime Minister remarked that the Mandal Commission report was shelved for decades leading to delays in the reservation for OBCs. The Prime Minister noted that if reservations had been granted earlier, many OBC individuals would be serving in various positions today.\\n\\nTouching upon the extensive discussions on whether reservations should be based on religion during the drafting of the Constitution, PM Modi said that the constitution framers concluded that for the unity and integrity of a country like India, reservations based on religion or community were not feasible.\\n\\nHe added that it was a well-considered decision, not an oversight. PM Modi remarked that the previous governments introduced reservations based on religion, which goes against the spirit of the Constitution. He noted that despite some implementations, the Supreme Court has struck down such measures.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister said that it is clear that there is an intention to provide reservations based on religion, which is a shameless attempt to hurt the sentiments of the Constitution\\'s framers.\\n\\nDiscussing the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) as a burning issue which was not overlooked by the Constituent Assembly, the PM said that the Constituent Assembly engaged in extensive discussions on the UCC and decided that it would be best for the elected government to implement it. He added that this was the directive of the Constituent Assembly. The Prime Minister remarked that Dr Ambedkar advocated for the UCC, and his words should not be misrepresented.\\n\\nPM Modi highlighted that Dr. B.R. Ambedkar strongly advocated for the abolition of personal laws based on religion. Quoting K.M. Munshi, a member of the Constituent Assembly, who stated that a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) is essential for national unity and modernity, PM Modi said that the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized the need for a UCC and has directed governments to implement it as soon as possible. He emphasised that, in keeping with the spirit of the Constitution and the intentions of its framers, the government is fully committed to establishing a secular civil code.\\n\\nReciting an incident of the past, the Prime Minister questioned how those who do not respect their own party\\'s constitution can respect the country\\'s Constitution.\\n\\nPM Modi noted that in 1996, the BJP emerged as the largest party, and the President, respecting the Constitution, invited them to form the government. However, the government lasted only 13 days because they chose to honour the Constitution. He emphasised that former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee did not opt for bargaining but respected the Constitution and resigned after 13 days.\\n\\nHe added that in 1998, the NDA government faced instability, but former PM Vajpayee\\'s government, dedicated to the spirit of the Constitution, preferred to lose by one vote and resign rather than accept unconstitutional positions. He emphasised that this is their history, values, and tradition. On the other hand, he noted that during the cash-for-votes scandal, money was used to save a minority government, turning the spirit of Indian democracy into a marketplace where votes were bought.\\n\\nPM Modi remarked that after 2014, the NDA got the opportunity to serve, strengthening the Constitution and democracy. He highlighted that they launched a campaign to rid the country of old ailments. The Prime Minister noted that over the past 10 years, they had also made constitutional amendments, for the unity and integrity of the country, for its bright future, and with full dedication to the spirit of the Constitution.\\n\\nThe PM remarked that the OBC community had been demanding constitutional status for the OBC Commission for three decades. He highlighted that they amended the Constitution to grant this status, taking pride in doing so. The Prime Minister emphasised that standing with the marginalised sections of society is their duty, which is why the constitutional amendment was made.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister underscored that there was a large section of society that, regardless of caste, could not access opportunities due to poverty and could not progress.\\n\\nNoting that this dissatisfaction was growing, and despite demands, no decisions were made, PM Modi said that his government amended the Constitution to provide 10 per cent reservation for economically weaker sections of the general category. He emphasised that this was the first reservation amendment in the country that faced no opposition, was accepted with love by everyone, and was passed unanimously by Parliament. The Prime Minister remarked that this was because it strengthened social unity and aligned with the spirit of the Constitution.\\n\\nPM Modi highlighted that they have also made constitutional amendments, but these were to empower women. He added that his government amended the Constitution for the unity of the country. PM Modi highlighted that Dr B.R. Ambedkar\\'s Constitution could not fully apply to Jammu and Kashmir due to Article 370, while the government wanted Ambedkar\\'s Constitution to be implemented in every part of India. He added that they amended the Constitution to strengthen national unity and to pay tribute to Dr Ambedkar. The Prime Minister said his government removed Article 370, and now the Supreme Court has also upheld this decision.\\n\\nTouching upon the amendment of the Constitution to remove Article 370, PM Modi highlighted that his government also enacted laws to fulfill the promise made by Mahatma Gandhi and other senior leaders at the time of partition, to care for minorities in neighbouring countries during times of crisis. He emphasised that his government introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) to honour this commitment and said that it proudly stands by this law, as it aligns with the spirit of the Constitution and strengthens the nation.\\n\\nPM Modi remarked that the constitutional amendments made by his government were aimed at correcting past mistakes and paving the way for a brighter future. He highlighted that time will tell if they stand the test of time. The Prime Minister emphasised that these amendments were not driven by selfish power interests but were acts of virtue for the nation\\'s benefit. He noted that this is why his government confidently addressed any questions raised.\\n\\nNoting that numerous speeches and topics have been raised regarding the Constitution, each with its own political motivations, the PM said that the Constitution is most sensitive to the people of India, \"We the People,\" and is meant for their welfare, dignity, and well-being. He noted that the Constitution guides us towards a welfare state, ensuring a dignified life for all citizens.\\n\\nHighlighting that after so many years of independence, many families did not have access to a toilet to live with dignity, PM Modi said that the campaign to build toilets was a dream for the poor, and they took it up with full dedication. He added that despite being mocked, they remained steadfast because the dignity of ordinary citizens was their priority. The PM emphasised that women had to go for open defecation either before sunrise or after sunset, and this did not bother those who only saw the poor on TV or in newspaper headlines. The Prime Minister remarked that those who do not understand the life of the poor would not commit such injustices. PM Modi questioned that eighty per cent of the people in this country were deprived of clean drinking water, despite the Constitution\\'s aim to ensure basic human amenities for everyone.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister remarked that millions of mothers in the country used to cook on traditional stoves, causing their eyes to turn red from the smoke, which was equivalent to inhaling the smoke of hundreds of cigarettes. He highlighted that this not only affected their eyes but also deteriorated their health. PM Modi said that even after 70 years of independence until 2013, the discussion was about whether to provide nine or six cylinders, while his government ensured the delivery of gas cylinders to every household because they prioritised providing basic amenities to every citizen.\\n\\nDiscussing the healthcare sector, PM Modi said that a single illness can ruin a poor family who works hard day and night to escape poverty and educate their children, their plans and efforts. He highlighted that they implemented the Ayushman Bharat scheme to provide free treatment to 50-60 crore citizens, respecting the spirit of the Constitution. The Prime Minister noted that this scheme ensures healthcare for all, including those above 70 years of age, from any section of society.\\n\\nTouching upon the free ration provided to the poor, PM Modi highlighted that 25 crore people have successfully overcome poverty. He added that only those who have emerged from poverty understand the importance of support. He highlighted that just as a patient is advised to take care after being discharged from the hospital to avoid relapse, it is essential to support the poor to prevent them from falling back into poverty. The Prime Minister noted that this is why they provide free ration, to ensure that those who have been lifted out of poverty do not return to it, and to help those still in poverty to rise above it. He emphasised that mocking this effort is unjust, as it is crucial for maintaining the dignity and well-being of the citizens.\\n\\nRemarking that only slogans were made in the name of the poor, and banks were nationalised in their name, PM Modi highlighted that until 2014, 50 crore citizens in the country had never seen the inside of a bank. He added that they had opened bank accounts for 50 crore poor citizens, thus opening the doors of banks for them. The Prime Minister noted that a former Prime Minister once said that out of Rs 1 sent from Delhi, only 15 paise reached the poor. He emphasised that they have shown the way by ensuring that today, out of Rs 1 sent from Delhi, all 100 paise are deposited directly into the accounts of the poor. The Prime Minister said that his government has demonstrated the proper use of banks. He added that those who were previously not allowed to even approach the doors of banks can now avail loans without any guarantee. He highlighted that this empowerment of the poor is a testament to the government\\'s dedication to the Constitution.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister noted that the slogan \"Garibi Hatao\" (eradicate poverty) remained just a slogan because the poor were not freed from their difficulties. He emphasised that his government\\'s mission and commitment are to liberate the poor from these hardships, and they are working day and night to achieve this. The Prime Minister remarked that he stands for those who have no one to support them.\\n\\nTouching upon the struggles encountered by differently-abled citizens, PM Modi said that they have now provided accessible infrastructure for differently-abled individuals, allowing their wheelchairs to reach train compartments. He added that this initiative was driven by their concern for the marginalised sections of society. He emphasised that while disputes over language were taught, great injustice was done to differently-abled individuals. The Prime Minister remarked that sign language systems varied across states, causing difficulties for the differently-abled. He highlighted that his government has created a common sign language, which is now benefiting all differently-abled individuals in the country.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister said that the nomadic and semi-nomadic communities had no one to look after their welfare. He added that his government established a welfare board for their well-being, as these people are a priority under the Constitution. The Prime Minister noted that street vendors, who work tirelessly from morning to night, often face hardships, including renting their carts and borrowing money at high interest rates. He emphasised that the government introduced the PM SVANidhi scheme to provide collateral-free loans to street vendors. The Prime Minister remarked that due to this scheme, street vendors have reached the third round of loans, gaining respect and expanding their businesses.\\n\\nNoting that there is no one in this country who does not need the services of Vishwakarma artisans, PM Modi highlighted that a significant system had been in place for centuries, but the welfare of Vishwakarma artisans was never addressed. The Prime Minister noted that they have created a plan for the welfare of Vishwakarma artisans, including provisions for bank loans, new training, modern tools, and innovative designs. He emphasised that his government has strengthened this initiative to support the Vishwakarma community.\\n\\nPM Modi highlighted that the government had ensured rights for transgender individuals under the Indian Constitution and has enacted laws to protect their rights and provide them with a dignified life.\\n\\nRecalling during his stint as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, there was not a single science stream school in the entire tribal belt from Umargam to Ambaji, the Prime Minister noted that without science stream schools, tribal students couldn\\'t become engineers or doctors. He emphasised that they established science stream schools and universities in the area, addressing the educational needs of the tribal community.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister expressed gratitude to the President for guidance in creating the PM Jan Man Yojana, which focuses on the development of the most backward tribal communities. He highlighted that these small groups, often overlooked in vote politics, have now received attention and support through this scheme. The Prime Minister remarked that he is committed to finding and supporting even the most marginalised individuals.\\n\\nPM Modi noted that over 60 years, 100 districts were identified as backward, and this label became a punishment posting for responsible officers. He emphasised that his government changed this situation by introducing the concept of Aspirational Districts, regularly monitoring 40 parameters online. The Prime Minister said that today, Aspirational Districts are matching the best districts in their states and some are even reaching the national average. He highlighted that no region should be left behind, and they are now focusing on developing 500 blocks as Aspirational Blocks.\\n\\nHighlighting that the tribal community existed during the times of Ram and Krishna, yet no separate ministry was created for them even after decades of independence, the Prime Minister noted that it was the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee that first established a separate Ministry for tribal affairs and allocated a budget for their development and expansion. Speaking on the welfare of the fishermen, PM Modi said that for the first time, their government created a separate ministry of fisheries and a separate budget was given for their welfare. He said care was taken of this section of the society.\\n\\nConcerning the small farmers of the country, the Prime Minister remarked that cooperation is an important part of their lives. Highlighting concerns of small farmers, he said a separate cooperative ministry was created to give strength to the life of the small farmer by making the cooperative sector responsible, strong and empowering. Emphasising the importance of a skilled workforce, PM Modi said the whole world is yearning for a workforce today. He said if we want to get a demographic dividend in the country, then this workforce of ours should be skilled. He added that a separate skill ministry was created so that the youth of the country are prepared according to the needs of the world and they move forward with the world.\\n\\nTalking about the North-East, the Prime Minister said our North-East was neglected due to fewer votes or seats there. He said it was former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee\\'s government which for the first time made the DONER Ministry for the welfare of the North-East and today because of it one can see the development of the North-East in the building of railways, roads, ports and airports.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister underlined the importance of land records and problems faced therein even today in the most prosperous of countries. He said all efforts were made by the government to provide for ownership of the lands, so that every common man in the village has the land records of his house, the ownership papers of his house so that loans from the bank can be taken and there is no fear of illegal occupation.\\n\\nPM Modi said due to all these works, the efforts made in the last 10 years have strengthened the poor with new self-confidence and in such a short time 25 crore people have been successful in defeating poverty. He said all this could be possible because his government is working under the direction of the constitution.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister said \"Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\", is not a mere slogan, It is our article of faith and hence we have implemented government schemes without discrimination. He said the government is striving for saturation of schemes so that 100 per cent of the beneficiaries get the benefit. He added that if there is any true secularism then it is in saturation and if there is any true social justice then this saturation, that is the 100 per cent benefit should be given to the person who is entitled to it, without any discrimination. He said this is true secularism and true social justice.\\n\\nSpeaking about the spirit of the Constitution as the medium to give direction to the country, the Prime Minister said politics is at the centre as the driving force of the country. He said we should think about what should be the direction of our democracy, and our politics in the coming decades.\\n\\nPM Modi questioned some parties about their political selfishness and sense of power and whether they ever thought about it themselves and said that he meant this for all the parties. He said these are the thoughts of his mind that he wanted to put before this House.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister emphasised that all political parties should make efforts to attract the youth of the country, to strengthen the democracy and to bring the youth of the country forward. He said bringing youth into politics is the need of the country\\'s democracy and reiterated that one lakh such youth should be brought into the country\\'s politics, who do not have any political family background. He said the country needs new energy and young people who come with new resolutions and dreams and when we are celebrating 75 years of the Constitution of India we should move ahead in that direction.\\n\\nRecalling his words about our duties in the Constitution from the Red Fort, PM Modi said it was unfortunate that it was not understood that while the Constitution has determined the rights of the citizens it also expects duties from them. He said the essence of our civilisation is Dharma, our Duty, Quoting Mahatma Gandhi ji he said that Mahatma ji had said that he had learnt from his uneducated but learned mother that the rights emerge from how we perform our duties.\\n\\nPM Modi said he would like to take Mahatma ji\\'s words forward and say that if we follow our fundamental duties then no one can stop us from making a developed India. He said that 75 years of the Constitution should give more strength to our dedication towards duty, our commitment and the need of the hour is that the country should move forward with a sense of duty.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister said that inspired by the spirit of the Constitution for the future of India he wanted to place 11 resolutions before the House. The first resolution is that whether it is a citizen or the government, everyone should perform their duties. The second resolution is that every sector and every society should get the benefit of development, Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas. The third resolution is that there should be zero tolerance towards corruption, there should be no social acceptance of the corrupt. The fourth resolution is that the citizens of the country should take pride in following the laws of the country, the rules of the country, and the traditions of the country. The fifth resolution is to get rid of the mentality of slavery, there should be pride in the heritage of the country. The sixth resolution is that the politics of the country should be freed from nepotism. Seventh resolution, the constitution should be respected, the constitution should not be used as a weapon for political gain. Eighth resolution, in keeping the spirit of the constitution, reservation should not be snatched from those who are getting it and every attempt to give reservation based on religion should be stopped. Ninth resolution, India should become an example for the world in women-led development. The tenth resolution is the development of the nation through the development of the state, which should be our mantra of development. Eleventh resolution, the aim of \"Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat\" should be paramount.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister said that if we all move forward together with this resolution then with everyone\\'s efforts, We the people, can fulfil the dream of a developed India.\\n\\nHe said when the dream of 140 crore countrymen is fulfilled and the country starts moving with the resolution, then it brings the desired results.\\n\\nPM Modi said he had immense respect for 140 crore countrymen and faith in their strength, he had immense faith in the youth power of the country, in the women power of the country.\\n\\nConcluding his remarks the Prime Minister said that we should move forward with the resolve that when the country celebrates 100 years of independence in 2047, it will be celebrated as Viksit Bharat.\\n\\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor'}, {'topic': 'Religion Unity', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech and religion unity', 'title': 'Why do at least six anti-LGBTQIA+ hate groups have special consultative status inside the United Nations?', 'url': 'https://www.gaytimes.com/uncloseted/why-do-at-least-six-anti-lgbtqia-hate-groups-have-special-consultative-status-inside-the-united-nations/', 'published_date': '2024-12-12T17:04:19Z', 'source': 'GAY TIMES', 'content': 'THIS ARTICLE FIRST APPEARED ON UNCLOSETED MEDIA A NEW INVESTIGATIVE LGBTQIA+ FOCUSSED NEWS PUBLICATION\\n\\nIn November of 2023 at the United Nations in New York City, the Political Network for Values held their fifth Transatlantic Summit event.\\n\\nThe conference was called \"Affirming universal human rights: Uniting Cultures for life, family, and fundamental freedoms.\" It was attended by a variety of far-right Christian groups that have historically advocated for anti-LGBTQIA+ policies.\\n\\nOne of those groups is Alliance Defending Freedom. At the conference, Emilie Kao, the group\\'s senior counsel and vice president of advocacy strategy, took the floor to express her outrage that a Finnish doctor was put on trial for referring to homosexuality as \"a developmental disorder,\" \"a shame and a sin\" and as a form of \"genetic degeneration.\"\\n\\n\"Thank God she was unanimously acquitted,\" said Kao.\\n\\nAustin Ruse, president of the Center for Family and Human Rights (otherwise known as C-Fam), who has supported laws that would criminalise homosexual behaviour and has also said that hard left people that run modern universities should be \"taken out and shot,\" spoke about some of his group\\'s recent accomplishments. \"There is no redefinition of the family because we stopped them. Sexual orientation and gender identity has never become a category of nondiscrimination in international law, because we have stopped them,\" he said.\\n\\nKao, C-Fam and ADF did not respond to requests for comment. Ruse disputed that he called for the criminalization of gay sex, saying that he was only offering \"a hypothetical.\" He added that he has \"never advocated that anyone be taken out and shot.\"\\n\\nThe access and influence of these anti-LGBTQIA+ groups inside the UN isn\\'t limited to this summit. Both hold what\\'s known as Special Consultative status at the UN. And they\\'re not the only ones.\\n\\nIn a months-long investigation, Uncloseted Media found that at least six Southern Poverty Law Center-designated anti-LGBTQIA+ hate groups hold this coveted status, which is granted by the UN\\'s Economic and Social Council.\\n\\n\"What\\'s astounding is I\\'m not sure anybody\\'s ever produced a list,\" says Heidi Beirich, who oversaw SPLC\\'s annual designation of hate groups from 2012 to 2019. \"These organisations have been stealthily inserting themselves into bodies whose beliefs they don\\'t share for years,\" she says.\\n\\n\"Many of these organisations don\\'t even believe in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\" she says.\\n\\nSpecial Consultative Status -- which is held by more than 5000 groups -- gives members unique access to the UN and its subsidiary bodies, to the various human rights mechanisms of the organisation and to special events organised by the President of the General Assembly.\\n\\nThe UN did not respond to repeated interview requests as well as requests for comment.\\n\\n\"You have access to member states, right? So I think the danger of all of this is access to the members who make decisions on resolutions. Who make UN policy,\" says Gillian Kane, director of global policy and research at Ipas, a non-governmental organisation that focuses on advancing gender equity and reducing the harm of U.S. foreign policy.\\n\\nKane, who attended the November Summit, says this status \"legitimises these groups\" who have clear track records that conflict with the core principles of the UN, like the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing subtle about what they do. They hate gays and they\\'re unapologetic to go after it,\" says Kane.\\n\\nMany of these groups have been around for decades, advocating against the LGBTQIA+ community. Kao\\'s group, ADF, published a press release titled \"ADF increases global impact with new status at United Nations\" when they were granted consultative status in 2010. \"ADF can now have a say when UN treaties and conventions are drafted that directly impact religious liberty and important matters related to the sanctity of life, marriage, and the family,\" the release said. It goes on to say that \"ADF will now be able to monitor and provide input on matters\" affecting religious freedoms.\\n\\nThe group, which consists of hundreds of lawyers in the U.S. and around the globe, was founded in 1994 by Alan Sears, who co-authored The Homosexual Agenda: Exposing the Principal Threat to Religious Freedom Today. Since then, they have advocated at the state and federal level for laws that promote conversion therapy and that would ban gays from serving in the military. In addition, they\\'ve testified in favour of laws that would strip transgender folks of the right to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity, that would prevent them from changing the name on their birth certificate and that would ban their access to gender affirming healthcare.\\n\\nIn addition, they have been effective globally through their international arm, ADF International. In 2012 in Jamaica, they advocated for the retention of a a law that criminalises gay sex. That law remains in effect. And in 2013, members of ADF worked to defend a Belize statute that makes anyone engaging in LGBTQIA+ sex subject to a punishment of up to 10 years in prison.\\n\\nThe other groups -- which include the Howard Center for Family Religion and Society (now known as International Organization for Family), Family Research Council, the Association of United Families International and the American Family Association of New York -- all have similar track records.\\n\\nSubscribe now\\n\\nFamily Research Council has advocated in favor of conversion therapy laws and continues to publish articles that falsely assert that \"sexual orientation change efforts\" are effective for gay people. And Tim Wildmon, the President of the American Family Association, is currently advocating for a boycott of Target for allowing trans people to use the bathroom or dressing room that matches their gender identity.\\n\\n\"Please use #BoycottTarget,\" Wildmon wrote in a special update on their website.\\n\\nBecause of these track records, Beirich felt it was \"a no brainer\" to add them to the SPLC\\'s list of hate groups alongside the Ku Klux Klan, the American Defense Skinheads and Aryan Nations.\\n\\n\"We put them on the hate list because they demonise the entire LGBTQIA+ population in derogatory, dehumanising language, just like the Klan would with Black people or Jewish people,\" says Beirich, now the co-founder and chief strategy officer at the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.\\n\\n\"People in the Christian right who have long demonised the LGBTQIA+ community have political power in this country, and it\\'s more normalised to hate queer people than to hate Black people for no damn good reason. Which is what we\\'re talking about. So it\\'s the biblically informed aspect of it that somehow legitimises it,\" says Beirich, who adds that she has \"absolutely no idea\" how these groups secured this status.\\n\\nSo how do these groups get here? While they all conform to basic principles required for Special Consultative Status, such as being a registered nonprofit and having specialised expertise on issues relevant to the UN, they are also expected to act in conformity with \"the spirit, purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,\" which specifically states that members must promote and encourage respect for human rights, take action \"to strengthen universal peace\" and -- specifically for members with consultative status -- must promote policies that encourage \"social progress.\"\\n\\nNeil Datta, the executive director for the European Parliamentary Forum for Sexual and Reproductive Rights, says part of the reason these groups are granted this status is due to overworked civil servants who work for the NGO Branch of the UN and are in charge of a preliminary screening of these applicants.\\n\\n\"The folks reviewing these applications are not necessarily thematic experts on anything. So they\\'re tasked with a very dry job of processing different applications that come in, and very legitimately won\\'t know what all of these different groups are,\" he says. \"Imagine you had 15 climate groups applying and one didn\\'t believe in climate change. It\\'s not necessarily that easy to understand.\"\\n\\nDatta says it can be even harder to identify anti-LGBTQIA+ groups because they often operate under the guise of protecting the family or the rights of the child.\\n\\n\"These groups have very nice names that aren\\'t obviously anti-LGBTQIA+. And so the people reviewing these applications may not be able to pick up on some of the subtleties,\" he says.\\n\\nIn addition, Datta says these groups use \"very clever vocabulary\" that sounds well meaning. But really, they are weaponising this language to penetrate powerful institutions like the UN \"In reality, they\\'re using religious freedom as a fig leaf for hate speech.\"\\n\\n\"But if you know your Catholic social doctrine, then you will recognise [this vocabulary] immediately.\" Datta says common dog whistles such as \"common good\" or \"human dignity\" and \"in favour of life [or] of the family\" are used almost exclusively to limit the human rights of others, \"usually in sexuality and reproduction.\"\\n\\nDatta says these \"codewords\" are another reason these groups go unnoticed within the UN. For example, during a three hour meeting at the November Transatlantic Summit event, participants used the term \"human dignity\" over 30 times.\\n\\nAfter they get through the preliminary screening by UN civil servants, their application is reviewed by the NGO Committee -- which meets twice a year -- to decide who they will recommend for Special Consultative Status. After review, the recommended organisations are presented to ECOSOC for their final decision.\\n\\nThis committee includes 19 countries, including multiple countries that have extremely hostile policies against LGBTQIA+ people, like Algeria, where homosexual activity is punishable by up to two years in prison; and Eritrea, where homosexuality is illegal and can be punished with jail-time.\\n\\n\"It honestly depends on who\\'s sitting on that committee. So if you have countries that already have anti-LGBTQIA+ policies in place, they\\'re going to be friendly to inviting these groups in and approving their status,\" says Kane.\\n\\nOnce these groups officially gain this status, they use religious freedom as a justification for promoting policies and laws that limit the rights of LGBTQIA+ people through the UN apparatus.\\n\\nThe UN Declaration of Human Rights does not yet explicitly protect folks who are discriminated against for their sexual orientation or gender identity. This lack of protection has given anti-LGBTQIA+ groups leverage in their arguments to roll back the rights of LGBTQIA+ folks.\\n\\nInside the UN, there are efforts to change this. For example, in 2019 the Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect published a Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech that outlines what constitutes hate speech and how to combat it. In it, they describe hate speech \"as any kind of communication in speech, writing or behaviour, that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender or other identity factor.\"\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, this new guidance is opposed by the anti-LGBTQIA+ hate groups. At the Political Network for Values Transatlantic Summit in November, ADF\\'s Kao said current hate speech laws protect too many different groups of people and in doing so infringe on religious freedom laws. \"Who can possibly know what would fall under such an expansive definition of hate?\" she said. \"These laws give a veto to any offended person, allowing them to censor their neighbours.\"\\n\\nBeirich strongly disagrees. \"You can\\'t use religion as a foil for harming communities and tearing into their civil and human rights. I don\\'t care,\" she says, adding that the Ku Klux Klan has weaponised religion as a means to discriminate against Black people since it was founded in 1865.\\n\\n\"It\\'s one thing to live your life however you want to live it biblically inspired. It\\'s a different thing to have that affect other people,\" says Beirich. \"Keep your views to yourself.\"\\n\\nAs these groups continue to operate inside the UN, what can be done? Datta says NGOs applying for Special Consultative Status should be subject to more rigorous background checks, where an independent body thoroughly examines the track record of applicants.\\n\\n\"What are the positions...of these organisations and what have they actually done?\" says Datta. \"What other things have they done which could be seen as having undermined human rights -- the UN\\'s Declaration of Human Rights?\"\\n\\nHe says using an independent body for this review would reduce the potential of political influences in the decision-making process.\\n\\nAs for those who already have Special Consultative Status, their status can be revoked if they don\\'t \"conform at all times to the principles governing the establishment.\"\\n\\nBeirich feels strongly that should happen swiftly for all six anti-LGBTQIA+ groups that currently hold this status. \"The United Nations should revoke the consultative status of people who stand opposed to the Universal Declaration. It shouldn\\'t stand for policies that are rolling back human rights -- it\\'s absurd.\"'}, {'topic': 'Religion Unity', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech and religion unity', 'title': \"France's Charlie Hebdo Holds God Cartoon Contest To Mark 10 Years Of Attack\", 'url': 'https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/frances-charlie-hebdo-holds-god-cartoon-contest-10-years-since-attack-7253624', 'published_date': '2024-12-15T10:54:00Z', 'source': 'NDTV', 'content': 'Charlie Hebdo has regularly tested the boundaries of French hate speech laws.\\n\\nParis:\\n\\nTen years after a deadly attack on its office that shocked France, Charlie Hebdo magazine is marking the anniversary with a cartoon contest mocking God, with Sunday the deadline for submissions.\\n\\nThe satirical weekly was targeted by two Islamic extremists on January 7, 2014, who gunned down eight members of staff including some of the country\\'s most famous cartoonists inside its premises in central Paris.\\n\\nThe attackers -- two brothers who were later killed by police -- targeted Charlie Hebdo after its decision to publish caricatures lampooning the Prophet Mohammed, Islam\\'s most revered figure.\\n\\nIn typically provocative style, the staunchly atheist magazine has invited cartoonists to submit the \"funniest and meanest\" drawings mocking God possible ahead of the anniversary.\\n\\nLaunching it last month with a deadline of December 15, it addressed a message to \"everyone who is fed up with living in a society directed by God and religion.

We saw and still see Americans put last, including our homeless veterans while illegal aliens prioritized. We have antisemitism and hate like I've never seen before. With 2 wars and the war in the Middle East because President Joe Biden funded our enemies, we saw the worst attack on our ally Israel since the Holocaust.\\n\\nI didn't want to give up but I knew our nation couldn't survive four more years of this. Thankfully the people spoke and we now will have the leader we need again in President Trump.\\n\\nPresident Trump has been called racist, a criminal, he's been framed, lied to, lied about, persecuted, prosecuted and convicted of crimes he never committed. In addition, he survived 3 assignation attempts. President Trump is not racist and he has committed no crimes. The only thing he did was love our country so much he stood up and still does, to the deep state, and he never backs down. I feel confident that President Trump will bring unity and prosperity to our nation along with Vice President Vance, the entire cabinet and one of my favorite people, Dr. Sebastian Gorka.\\n\\nThis should be a time to support them as they bring our country together that has been divided for years under Democratic rule. It is time to once again put America first and unite in that belief. We are lucky enough to live in the greatest country in the world and yet because so many have been brainwashed with hate and vitriolic lies it's a difficult thing to conquer. I still have unwavering faith in our country, President Trump, Vice President Vance, the new administration and Dr. Gorka.\\n\\nI also have faith in and believe in the goodness and grace of others to choose unity and not division. Together we can accomplish so much, we can all achieve our dreams but it's difficult with so many obstacles.\\n\\nI actually have recently faced obstacles myself. I wrote a previous op-ed on how the Department of Education has failed our students and parents alike. I was referring to public school and what I witnessed as a student in the public school I attended for I year. I also appeared on Fox News and reiterated what I felt and still feel about the DOE.\\n\\nThat op-ed and news appearance has caused a lot of stress and tension, a lot of anger within my school and yes, I have been bullied for supporting President Trump. I've been called racist which is ridiculous and untrue. I have lost people I thought were friends, and although it's been very difficult I will not waiver in my support of President Trump or my opinions of how our country had fallen apart in the past 4 years and President Trump's proven ability to save it. I was told because I don't believe DEI was being taught properly in public schools, that it was being used to divide kids that I am a racist. How anyone can think that from what I wrote or said is disturbing to me, but if someone won't listen to reason I can't make them.\\n\\nThe Democrats since Obama have used race to divide us: If you're white you're bad and if you're black you're oppressed. It only worsened with Obama and Harris. This is my opinion. I don't see or care about your skin color, your race, religion or sexual preference. I judge people on their own merits and that's the way it should be. I do believe DEI in the public schools is teaching kids to judge each other on skin color and religion instead of teaching kids that we are all equal and deserve equal opportunities. To me claiming white is bad and black people are victims creates a victim mentality and that to me is racism. Why is anyone better or worse because of their skin color, race or religion? They're not!\\n\\nI don't believe in a victim mentality, I believe no matter who you are you can achieve any goal but you have to work hard towards that goal, don't expect someone to do that for you. I will never judge anyone based on anything but morals, ethics, integrity and morality. I am raised that lying is a sin and we are on this earth to help others, not hate others. It hurt me deeply that I was called racist when just the opposite is true.\\n\\nI do not believe the DOE should be raising kids. I do not believe kids should be exposed to sex books or drag shows. I think schools should focus on education and giving kids the knowledge and skills they need to be successful. I believe parents' rights should never be questioned. I believe in free speech, I live by our Constitutional rights and I love and support President Trump and our country.\\n\\nI am told I'm in a cult because I support President Trump but why is wanting to Make America Great Again considered a cult?\\n\\nAs a Jewish conservative student I have never seen such divisiveness and hate. I sadly didn't realize how people would judge me just because I supported and will always support President Trump, I will always love our country, I will always fight for our constitutional rights and I will always see everyone as equal. I understand on a much smaller scale what President Trump goes through. I by no means am comparing myself to who I believe is the Greatest President we have ever had, I am simply pointing out I understand what he's faced.\\n\\nI don't believe we should ever notice our differences as we all bleed red and the only one that can limit your opportunities is you. We can all not just achieve our goals, we can exceed them. That's my wish for everyone and I won't stop caring or fighting for everyone to have those opportunities.\\n\\nI hope and pray this is a new beginning, that we will come together and not see or care about anything but what's in our hearts; hat whoever we choose as a candidate doesn't mean we have to hate each other because we have a difference in opinion. We all have a diversity of thoughts and opinions and that's a good thing but it shouldn't mean that it should separate us - we should embrace each other's differences and still realize in the end we are all Americans.\\n\\nPlease join me in supporting our great nation, President Trump, his cabinet and each other so we can have peace not only in our nation but in our local communities, our schools, our families and friendships.\\n\\nWe should all show respect to our President, our law enforcement and military heroes whether serving, retired, lost or fallen and respect our families, our friends and each other. We are put on this earth to make a difference, to help others in need and to pass on goodness to all including future generations to come. I hope we can all do that together, find a way to work together to create peace.\\n\\nDuring this holiday season, every season and every day, please realize how blessed we are to live in the greatest country in the world, and that we live free because of God, those who fought and died for us, and those still fighting for us today like President Trump. I hope we can all choose to be the good in this world and together we can help President Trump and each other to Make America Great Again.\\n\\nAuthor Recent Posts Jordan BraceJordan Brace is a California-based Gen Z political activist with over 120,000 followers on X.

It obtained complete responses from 611 adults 18 years old or above - 306 Malays, 200 Chinese, and 105 Indians.\\n\\nThe survey responses were derived from three questions: Whether the government should prohibit any discussion related to 3R issues even if the discussion is civil and rational; whether the government should prohibit hurtful or harmful comments in any discussion related to 3R issues; and whether the government should take stern action against the use, threat, or instigation of violence, whether or not the issue is related to the 3Rs.\\n\\nThe survey was conducted based on concerns whether Malaysia\\'s ethnic relations have deteriorated in recent years after democratisation when various sociopolitical forces were unleashed as society opened up.\\n\\n\"We decided that we wanted to find out for sure, especially after the KK Mart incident occurred, and subsequently more incidents came up,\" Projek Sama co-founder and Sunway University political scientist Prof Wong Chin Huat explains.\\n\\nThe KK Mart Group had in April made headlines when one of their outlets was found to be selling socks with the word \"Allah\" printed on them.\\n\\nProf Wong says most Malaysians value interdependence and prefer a balanced approach.\\n\\nAround 78% of the Malay respondents want the government to \"take stern actions against the use, threat, or instigation of violence, whether or not the issue is related to the 3Rs\".\\n\\n\"In contrast, 67% of the Malay respondents want the government to \\'prohibit hurtful or harmful comments in 3R discussions\\' while only 41% of the Malay respondents want the government \\'to prohibit any discussion related to 3R issues even if the discussion is civil and rational\\'.\"\\n\\nAmong the non-Malays, the survey found a similar but lower pattern of support on these three issues; Indian respondents are calling for action against violence at 63%, while prohibition of hate speech in 3R discussions at 56% and prohibition of all 3R discussions at 34%. Meanwhile, the number of Chinese respondents stands at 55%, 42%, and 26% respectively.\\n\\nProf Wong notes that Malaysia does not have a specific or new law on 3R issues, and the government should lift the blanket ban.\\n\\n\"It is for their own good. A blanket ban is simply impossible to execute because race, religion, and royalty play significant roles in our public life. Insisting on a blanket ban only gets the outcome of inconsistency or at least allegations of inconsistency.\\n\\n\"And guess what? When people think the government is biased, one common interpretation is that because the government is privileging the other ethnic or religious communities over our ethnic/religious community, so more bitterness grows around 3R matters. Completely counter-productive.\"\\n\\nLook at the real problem\\n\\nProf Wong points out that the real threat to society is violence followed by hate speech, not \"sensitive issues\".\\n\\n\"We hope the government and other authorities will take note that the real threat to our society is first violence, next hate speech and not the so-called sensitive issues.\\n\\n\"If anyone thinks that actions against violence would alienate the Malays, then the answer is the opposite,\" he says, referring to - four petrol bombs in the first three months of 2024, at Beruas MP Ngeh Koh Ham\\'s home, then at three KK Mart outlets.\\n\\n\"More than the Chinese and Indians, the Malays interviewed are strongly against violence.\"\\n\\nHe adds that inaction on the real violence could be seen as weak and soft on threats to public safety and law and order.\\n\\n\"If it\\'s caused by limitations in capacity - for example, all CCTVs around the four bombing sites were mysteriously not working - then government must put in more resources to avoid the \\'broken windows\\' effect, as acts of violence can easily inspire copycat actions,\" he says.\\n\\nProf Wong shares that many also feel that more fairness is needed in the actions taken.\\n\\n\"I embed myself in many WhatsApp groups in various languages and ethnoreligious orientations, and one common theme is this: The government is siding others. You can almost collect them to publish anthology.\\n\\nThe good news from the survey\\'s findings, according to him, is that while a majority of respondents across all three ethnic groups in West Malaysia thought that the government is not fair, more Malays (41% to 17%) and Chinese (32% to 23%) saw that unfairness from a class perspective than an ethnic perspective - that is, \"privileging the rich and the powerful over ordinary people like me\".\\n\\nHaving said that, if the 3R issues blanket ban continues - inevitably with inconsistent applications - more resentment would occur on all sides of the divide, says Prof Wong.\\n\\nPromote fairness and understanding\\n\\nProf Wong says there are two broad directions that can be worked on.\\n\\nFirst is to promote fairness.\\n\\n\"Both in public life in Malaysia and in the international arena, ethnoreligious centrism and exclusivism grow when people think the system is unfair.\\n\\n\"When people get so cynical as to stop believing in a fair world, they tend to be resentful of \\'the other\\' and crave \\'unity\\' within their own ethnoreligious/civilisational category to go against others.\\n\\n\"The good news is most Malaysians see our interdependence and prefer a balanced approach, believing that respect for Islam and respect for multiculturalism must go hand-in-hand.\"\\n\\nThis makes it important to take the second direction, which is to promote understanding.\\n\\n\"Our survey question on restrictions on personal freedom shows the greatest cross-ethnic divide between Malays and non-Malays. This is not surprising but there are still some convergences. At the same time, some of these issues may mean different things for different peoples.\\n\\n\"For example, halal requirement for Malays may mean assurance of getting religiously-compliant food, but for non-Malays it may imply restrictions to getting access to pork and alcohol.\\n\\n\"In other words, it is actually possible to find some convergences as it is possible to satisfy both Malays and non-Malays to some extent, if we have enough understanding and respect.\"\\n\\nProf Wong says Projek Sama hopes to carry out a similar survey in Sabah and Sarawak soon.\\n\\n\"Projek Sama\\'s inaugural survey only covered West Malaysia this round because of financial constraints. We were very grateful to our low-profile sponsor for a seed fund to kickstart this project.\"\\n\\nHence, he says, Projek Sama, in collaboration with pollster Invoke decided to focus on ethnic relations in West Malaysia first where ethnic relations are most challenging - \"It\\'s a bit like the situation during Covid-19 pandemic, if you don\\'t have enough vaccines, you send them to the area with the highest cases.\"\\n\\n\"We are working to get more funding for the next quarter so that we can have bigger samples from both West Malaysia as well as Sabah and Sarawak,\" Prof Wong says.'}], [{'topic': 'Race Polarization', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech and racial polarization in social media', 'title': \"Experts of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination Welcome Greece's Guide on Reporting Hate Crimes, Ask about Alleged Violations of the Rights of Minorities and Asylum Seekers - Greece\", 'url': 'https://reliefweb.int/report/greece/experts-committee-elimination-racial-discrimination-welcome-greeces-guide-reporting-hate-crimes-ask-about-alleged-violations-rights-minorities-and-asylum-seekers', 'published_date': '2024-12-04T17:14:47Z', 'source': 'ReliefWeb', 'content': 'The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination today concluded its consideration of the combined twenty-third and twenty-fourth periodic report of Greece. Committee Experts commended the State on its guide on reporting hate crimes, and asked questions on alleged excessive use of force against minorities by the police and violations of the rights of asylum seekers by the Hellenic Coast Guard.\\n\\nOne Committee Expert welcomed the guide on reporting hate crimes. Were victims of hate crimes made aware of this guide?\\n\\nBakri Sidiki Diaby, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said there had been several allegations of excessive use of force against minorities by the police. How was the State party ensuring that all allegations were properly investigated, perpetrators punished, and victims granted reparations?\\n\\nMr. Diaby said that since March 2020, a significant deterioration had been noted in the security of persons from third countries seeking asylum in the east of Greece. There had been reports of summary forced return, secret detention, confiscation of personal effects, and intrusive searches. What steps had been taken to investigate these alleged violations of human rights and to prevent such violations?\\n\\nIntroducing the report, Aikaterini Patsogianni, Secretary General of Equality and Human Rights, Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family Affairs of Greece and head of the delegation, said that, in the fight against racism, police authorities had developed standards and guidance in areas such as training and capacity building of law enforcement, improved recording and collection of data on hate crimes, as well as cooperation between law enforcement and civil society organizations, and ways to address underreporting.\\n\\nThe delegation said one key initiative of the national action plan against racism and intolerance was the guide for victims on reporting hate crimes, which had been translated into nine languages and published online. Several training activities had been held to improve State authorities\\' response to hate crimes.\\n\\nPolice personnel were obliged to respect human rights and perform their duties based on respect for individuals, the delegation said. Over 1,000 cases of police misdemeanours had been conveyed to the Ombudsman, and around 660 disciplinary sanctions had been implemented.\\n\\nThe delegation said the Hellenic Coast Guard\\'s practices followed international law. Protecting human life at sea and aiding those in distress, without any form of discrimination, was the highest duty of the Coast Guard. All allegations of pushbacks were appropriately investigated by monitoring bodies. The Coast Guard had saved and continued to save thousands of lives at sea. From 2013, Coast Guard officers had been trained in basic human rights principles.\\n\\nIn concluding remarks, Mr. Diaby thanked the delegation for the dialogue, which had been intensive, fruitful, frank and necessary. The questions raised by the Committee aimed to assess progress in the implementation of the Convention to help the Committee to develop recommendations that were helpful to Greece.\\n\\nIn his concluding remarks, Ioannis Ghikas, Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said the dialogue had been intense but constructive, identifying issues that the State party needed to address. The State was proud of the progress it had made since the last review, including in protecting the rights of asylum seekers and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons.\\n\\nThe delegation of Greece consisted of representatives of the Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family Affairs; Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Ministry of Interior; Ministry of Education, Religious Affairs and Sports; Ministry of Health; Ministry of Citizen Protection; Ministry of Labour and Social Security; Ministry of Justice; Ministry of Migration and Asylum; Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Insular Policy; Hellenic Labour Inspectorate; Presidency of the Government; and the Permanent Mission of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva.\\n\\nThe Committee will issue its concluding observations on the report of Greece after the conclusion of its one hundred and fourteenthOpens in new window session on 13 December.

The State party had taken significant initiatives to combat racial discrimination, including by implementing the national action plan on preventing racism and intolerance, laws combatting hate speech, and training programmes for law enforcement officials. The State party had also adopted a national action plan on preventing anti-Semitism and had made efforts to promote the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, including by implementing legislation on same-sex marriage.\\n\\nProgress had been made despite the decade-long economic crisis that Greece had been facing. The racist \"Golden Dawn\" organization had been banned from participating in political activities and its leaders had been imprisoned. Civil society continued to support the State party\\'s efforts to prevent racism and intolerance. There was much work to be done, but Greece was committed to addressing the issues it faced, and looked forward to the recommendations of the Committee.\\n\\nAIKATERINI PATSOGIANNI, Secretary General of Equality and Human Rights, Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family Affairs of Greece and head of the delegation, said that since the last review, Greece had been advancing toward long-term sustainable economic progress, supporting its human rights and anti-racism framework. In the fight against racism, police authorities had developed standards and guidance in areas such as training and capacity building of law enforcement, improved recording and collection of data on hate crimes, as well as cooperation between law enforcement and civil society organizations, and ways to address underreporting. The judicial system responded to organizations that exploited the economic crisis and the resulting fractures to the social fabric to commit criminal racist acts, while the legislature took measures to protect and safeguard the democratic electoral process from such criminal organizations.\\n\\nThe National Council against Racism and Intolerance, in which independent bodies also participated, adopted its first national action plan in December 2020. Efforts for the second action plan were underway, with funding secured for a results-driven agenda. In this regard, the State party was ready to work with relevant stakeholders, including the Racist Violence Recording Network.\\n\\nGreece was actively implementing the National Strategy on the Roma 2021-2030, guided by the principle of \"for the Roma, with the Roma.\" Key committees, including the independent Roma Forum, were fully operational. All available European Union funding was used to enhance the Roma\\'s employment, education, healthcare and housing.\\n\\nOn migration, modernised reception facilities ensured dignified conditions and targeted care for vulnerable groups, while a robust system supported unaccompanied minors. The Asylum Service had significantly improved in efficiency. The \"HELIOS\" project and legal reforms promoted integration and labour market access. Enhanced international cooperation also provided pathways for organised, legal migration.\\n\\nBorder protection was carried out in line with domestic, European and international law. Protecting human life at sea and aiding those in distress, without any form of discrimination, was the highest duty of the Hellenic Coast Guard. Allegations of violations of the principle of non-refoulement were inconsistent with the operational activities of the competent agencies. The State had put in place a multi-level policy for the effective monitoring of fundamental rights. The Hellenic Coast Guard had saved and continued to save thousands of lives at sea.\\n\\nGreece had ratified International Labour Organization Convention 190 to create a work environment free from violence and harassment. Public authorities detected and protected all trafficking victims, without discrimination, in line with the principles of the Office of the National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings and the National Referral Mechanism.\\n\\nInclusive education was promoted through various initiatives and teacher training programmes. Key efforts included the \"Active Citizens\\' Actions\" curriculum supporting the Sustainable Development Goals, a 2023 anti-bullying law with a reporting platform, a mobile phone ban to reduce cyberbullying, and the introduction of \"Digital School\" and \"Skills Lab\" to enhance digital learning.\\n\\nThe State party had also established an independent Committee of Deontology, aimed at countering all types of expression in printed and electronic media that incited, promoted, spread or justified violence, hatred or discriminatory speech. Human rights education, training and awareness-raising activities, including for law enforcement personnel and members of the judiciary, remained top priorities.\\n\\nQuestions by a Committee Expert\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, thanked Greece for supporting the candidacy of Greek Expert Stamatia Stavrinaki to the Committee, who made remarkable contributions to its work.\\n\\nCould the delegation provide information on the ethnic makeup of the population and of asylum seekers and refugees living in the State party? The Committee was concerned by the general lack of disaggregated data on racial discrimination. What measures were in place to implement a comprehensive data collection system?\\n\\nWhat measures had the State party taken to address excessive use of force by the police? There had been several allegations of such excessive use of force against minorities. How was the State party ensuring that all allegations were properly investigated, perpetrators punished, and victims granted reparations?\\n\\nThere was a limited number of convictions for cases involving racial discrimination and official data on cases reported to the police was not accessible to the public. The Committee was concerned that the new anti-racist law was not fully in line with the requirements of article four of the Convention as it did not criminalise the dissemination of ideas of racial superiority or prohibit racist organizations. What measures were in place to revise legislation to ensure that all incitement to racial, ethnic and religious hatred was criminalised and that perpetrators were punished? How had the police\\'s capacity to investigate racist crimes and to combat racist violence been increased? State services reportedly did not provide appropriate, timely support to victims of racist violence, who relied on support from civil society. Was a referral system for victims to State services being developed?\\n\\nOver the reporting period, there had been 89 reported cases of racism targeting asylum seekers and refugees. The Committee welcomed the various legislative measures undertaken to address racism. Were there gaps in the implementation of legislation on racism? Was there a media regulatory body that held journalists to account when they disseminated racist notions?\\n\\nWas the State party drafting a new national action plan to combat racism and intolerance? What results had the last action plan achieved? The National Council against Racism and Intolerance had been reactivated in 2024. What measures were in place to ensure that the Council could work effectively?\\n\\nWhy had there been delays in the registration of civil society organizations claiming to have minority status? Some minority associations had been dissolved; could the delegation comment on this?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece did not collect statistical data based on race and religious affiliations due to its protection of the right to privacy. Statistical data was collected on specific categories of beneficiaries of State policies, such as policies for the Roma. Data was also collected on the demographics of prison inmates, and on migrants, asylum seekers and refugees according to European Union regulations. A unified information system for reception and asylum was being developed. Data on migrants\\' gender, ethnicity and religion was collected.\\n\\nAfter 2015, there was an amendment to legislation concerning the punishment of hate crimes that facilitated the investigation and prosecution of cases by eliminating the need to prove the standard of \"hate\". Data from the judiciary and the Public Prosecutor showed that there had been better implementation of hate crime legislation in recent years. The State party also had legislation on hate speech and incitement to hatred that addressed speech inciting racial superiority.\\n\\n\"Golden Dawn\" was not allowed to participate in elections and State funding to it had been suspended. All political parties that acted as proxies for persons who had committed racist hate crimes were prohibited, and on this basis two political parties had recently been banned from participating in elections.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said human rights defenders were sometimes accused and condemned without having the opportunity to defend themselves. Did the State party intend to adopt special legislation to protect human rights defenders? Several dozens of cases of refoulement involving Greece had been examined by the European Court of Human Rights. Were border police trained on the handling of migrants? What aid had been provided to victims of police violence?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said that although the European Union directive on victim support had been incorporated into national legislation, there were allegations that the directive was not sufficiently applied, leading to impunity for perpetrators of racist acts. How did the State party collect data on foreign nationals in the prison system? What recommendations had been provided by the Racist Violence Reporting Network to the State and had these been implemented?\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert asked about the effectiveness of State policies. How many of the cases of police misconduct reported had resulted in sanctions? How many committees reviewing journalistic ethics had members of racial minority groups?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece had permitted the reopening of domestic court proceedings after decisions on three cases by the European Court of Human Rights. A committee of independent experts had been established to develop strategies for the implementation of the European Court\\'s decisions.\\n\\nPolice personnel were obliged to respect human rights and perform their duties based on respect for individuals. They needed to avoid prejudice based on distinguishing characteristics. The Hellenic Police transmitted relevant information to an independent Ombudsman concerning cases involving discrimination. Over 1,000 cases of police misdemeanours had been conveyed to the Ombudsman, and around 660 disciplinary sanctions had been implemented. Several cases related to racist actions by the police.\\n\\nThe law on audiovisual media services prohibited the dissemination of hate speech based on race and other characteristics. The National Media Advisory Authority had the competence to impose sanctions for disseminating hate speech through online and offline media. All print and online media needed to meet requirements related to the Journalistic Code of Ethics, which included prohibitions of hate speech. The Journalistic Ethics Committee was mandated to investigate all allegations of discriminatory speech. Its members were not appointed based on their ethnicity or sex but were journalists and academics.\\n\\nIn Greece, persons with low income could apply for free legal aid. Legal aid was also provided to victims in trafficking cases and to female victims of violence. Measures were in place to protect victims from secondary victimisation in legal proceedings. All victims were informed of their rights, including the right to compensation.\\n\\nThe Greek legislative framework did not have a specific law for the protection of human rights defenders; all persons were equal before the law.\\n\\nPrivate funding of political parties was strictly forbidden in Greece. Only State funding was legal for political parties. This was why State funding had been suspended for parties that engaged in hate crimes and hate speech.\\n\\nQuestions by a Committee Expert\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said not all incidents of racism were reported by victims, allegedly due to a lack of confidence in the authorities. What measures were in place to strengthen confidence in the justice system among citizens? Did the State party intend to establish an efficient data collection system on racist violence? How would it promote access to justice for victims of racial discrimination? How many complaints of racist hate speech and hate crimes had been received by the State and how many perpetrators had been prosecuted? In how many court cases had the Convention been cited? What measures had the State party taken to encourage the participation of civil society in the implementation of the Convention? Racism continued to be prevalent in the Attica region and in centres where refugees and asylum seekers were located. Did the State party intend to accept the Committee\\'s communications procedure?\\n\\nDiscrimination against minorities by authorities persisted. What recent educational initiatives had been implemented to combat intolerance and prejudice and promote intercultural dialogue? The State party had received the Global Education Award for establishing the Skills Lab, which promoted ethnic tolerance. Was this implemented in all regions of the State party and at all levels?\\n\\nThe Committee commended the State party for its efforts to create memorials of the Holocaust. There were 158 attacks based on religion recorded in 2023. What measures were in place to ensure efficient investigations of these incidents and to develop protection measures? There had also been an increase in cases of vandalism of religious sites and profanation in recent years. What measures were in place to put an end to these practices?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the police code of conduct required police to act with empathy toward vulnerable people. The State party collected data on hate speech and hate crimes, including data on racially motivated crimes.\\n\\nIn Greek prisons, data was collected on nationality. Foreigners from 101 nationalities made up 50 per cent of the prison population. These were persons who were convicted and serving these sentences in Greek prisons. Greece was on the crossroads of many routes, and many people in prisons in Greece were engaged in cross-border criminal activity.\\n\\nThe Ombudsperson received discrimination complaints. Racial discrimination complaints made up seven per cent of complaints received in 2023, up from two per cent in 2022. The labour inspectorate examined complaints of workplace discrimination. The inspectorate was empowered to instigate administrative sanctions. Three cases it investigated in 2023 involved discrimination on the grounds of nationality.\\n\\nThe police had established specialised departments to address violent hate crimes and hate speech and provide support to victims in Attica and the Eastern Aegean region. A hotline and online form for reporting hate crimes had been implemented, and several campaigns were underway on online hate speech. The police force was cooperating with civil society, which provided training to upgrade the capacities of police staff.\\n\\nThe Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure had been revised to make them more victim centred. Courts had been redistributed to improve citizens\\' access across the State. Domestic violence legislation had also been modernised.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, asked for statistics on victims of discrimination who had benefitted from free legal aid. There was a large gap between the records of racist violence of the Racist Violence Reporting NetworkOpens in new window and the Government. Why was this? On what basis was the second national action plan on addressing racism being devised?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said that it was quite shocking that 50 per cent of prisoners in Greece were non-nationals.\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert said that the State\\'s regulations on the provision of legal aid appeared to limit access to it. Would it consider implementing a system of reviewing all requests for legal aid, regardless of the type of crime?\\n\\nA Committee Expert asked whether the labour inspectorate assigned fines for workplace discrimination. Why were non-nationals in Attica most impacted by racist crimes? How did the State party apply the recommendations of the Racist Violence Reporting Network? The Expert welcomed the guide on reporting hate crimes. Were victims made aware of this guide?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the national action plan against racism and intolerance focused on addressing hate crimes, empowering minorities, and eliminating discrimination based on various characteristics. One key initiative was the guide for victims on reporting hate crimes, which had been translated into nine languages and distributed to migrant reception centres and published online. Several training activities had been held to improve State authorities\\' response to hate crimes.\\n\\nThe National Council against Racism and Intolerance had held meetings with civil society to develop the second national action plan on addressing racism and intolerance. It had secured funding to improve victims\\' access to State services. The Council would review the Committee\\'s recommendations and include them in the second national action plan, which would focus on strengthening data collection on hate crimes and developing more services for victims.\\n\\nThe Skills Lab initiative had been piloted nationwide. New curricula promoted human rights education and intercultural communication. Training courses were offered for teachers on human rights and inclusion. A digital platform for reporting school bullying and violence had been launched. As of April 2024, over 700 reports had been received, 10 per cent of which related to racism.\\n\\nVarious actions had been taken to provide education about the Holocaust. Greece was one of the first countries to return the property of victims of the Holocaust. The State collected data on vandalism of religious sites. In 2015, 147 cases were recorded.\\n\\nThe procedure for applying for free legal aid was very simple. Applicants needed only to supply documents proving that they had low income. Victims of almost all crimes could apply for this aid. Lawyers could be appointed for defendants in serious crimes with punishments of five years imprisonment or more.\\n\\nOn some occasions, victims of racist violence went to the Racist Violence Reporting Network but not to public authorities. In 2023, 115 cases had been opened by authorities. There was not a big gap between the number of cases collected by authorities and by the Network. More than half of the population lived in Attica. This was why most racist crimes were reported in this region.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said 18 per cent of asylum camp residents did not enjoy basic material conditions, including food and financial assistance. There were only 29 doctors, 92 nurses and 69 interpreters deployed across all the camps, some of which had more than 1,000 residents. What measures were in place to improve the situation in the camps and ensure that the detention of foreign nationals was only done as a last resort? How was the State party ensuring access to interpretation services for foreign nationals? What efforts had been made to develop a statelessness establishment procedure? How was the State party addressing barriers to refugees accessing official documents?\\n\\nWhat steps had been taken to investigate alleged violations of human rights in the context of border management and to prevent such violations? Was there regular independent surveillance of border forces and efforts to strengthen their capacity? Since March 2020, a significant deterioration had been noted in the security and safety of persons from third countries seeking asylum in the east of Greece. There had been reports of summary forced return of persons who had entered from Türkiye, secret detention without sufficient safeguards, confiscation of personal effects, and intrusive searches. There were also reports of private individuals towing and removing engines from asylum seekers\\' boats, and assisting officials in carrying out forced returns.\\n\\nGreece had not signed the statelessness convention and the Presidential decree on the statelessness determination procedure had not been promulgated. Around 3,740 people in Greece had stated that they had no nationality. What measures would the State party take to better address the issue of statelessness?\\n\\nThe Committee had previously expressed concern regarding low salaries and long working hours for migrant workers, particularly in the agricultural sector. What measures were in place to improve the situation of migrant workers? Was there a safe and accessible way of filing complaints related to workplace discrimination? What measures were in place to support undocumented migrants and protect them from trafficking and forced labour?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said seminars on human rights and diversity had been provided for over 1,600 public servants. Seminars had been held on the Holocaust for members of the Orthodox Church of Greece and on the basic principles of Islam for prison officers. Over 160 integrity advisors had also been trained and certified to support integrity in the public service. The national school of the judiciary provided mandatory training on human rights, gender-based violence and other topics. In 2024, 15 seminars had been planned for judges and 12 for court staff.\\n\\nGreece directly implemented the Convention in domestic law, which was why court decisions did not directly reference the Convention.\\n\\nIf infringements of labour laws were found, labour inspectors could impose administrative sanctions and fines, and file serious cases of non-compliance with the Prosecutor.\\n\\nRefugee children could enrol in reception classes without documentation. Language classes were offered for students after school hours. Educational guides assisted teachers in making refugee students feel welcome and safe.\\n\\nGreece was facing challenges with the arrival of third country nationals seeking to enter Europe through Türkiye. It had accelerated asylum procedures through the digitisation of asylum procedures. Health care insurance and tax identification numbers were provided to asylum seekers, who could access employment and healthcare throughout the State.\\n\\nOne of the main priorities of Greece\\'s migration policy was to improve asylum conditions. Case managers carried out rapid assessments of new arrivals\\' needs. Vulnerable persons were provided with specialised protection. More interpreters were being provided in collaboration with various public and private organizations and civil society. The \"HELIOS\" integration system offered support to refugees to access the labour market, health and education. Another initiative was specifically focused on providing language, vocational and intercultural training to refugees seeking to enter the job market.\\n\\nMigration legislation had been amended to reduce the number of migrants in informal employment. An agreement had been reached with Egypt on the provision of temporary employment to Egyptian citizens in the agricultural sector. An agreement was also reached with Bangladeshi citizens to improve access to formal employment. These agreements reenforced legal pathways to migration.\\n\\nThe average time taken to process asylum applications was now 100 days; formerly processing took years. Greece collaborated with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to develop a new system of naturalisation that was fairer for refugees and stateless persons. Around 55 applications for Greek citizenship had been received; only 16 were still pending, citizenship had been granted for the rest.\\n\\nPolice had circulated guidelines on the protection of the fundamental rights of refugees arriving in the State. No third country national was to be returned until their asylum application had been processed.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said violence and excessive use of force had been reported in asylum centres. Could the delegation comment on this? Mr. Diaby congratulated the State party on efforts to formalise the status of stateless persons. Did the State party intend to ratify the statelessness convention? How was the State party responding to racist incidents in sport?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert asked about the results of the human rights education strategies implemented by the State.\\n\\nFAITH DIKELEDI PANSY TLAKULA, Committee Expert and Follow-Up Rapporteur, said the Committee had previously recommended that the State party provide training to teachers on providing education to migrant children, ensure individual assessment of asylum applications, and protect against refoulement. What efforts had been made to improve migrants\\' access to asylum procedures and education?\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert said that in recent years, there had been a rise in hate speech across the world, including in Greece. What measures were in place to tackle racist hate speech targeting migrants and minorities, and xenophobia?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the State was proud of improvements that had been made in the situation on the State\\'s islands. The Hellenic Coast Guard\\'s practices followed international law. All allegations of pushbacks were appropriately investigated by monitoring bodies. From 2015 to the present, the Coast Guard had rescued over 250,000 persons at sea. From 2013, Coast Guard officers had been trained in basic human rights principles.\\n\\nGreece was stepping up efforts to prevent trafficking in persons through legal and policy instruments. The national action plan on trafficking in persons was being updated to address financial and labour exploitation. The State party had organised seminars and created standards on the financial aspects of these crimes. New forms of exploitation had been added to legislation. Accommodation, medical care and legal counselling were provided to victims of trafficking in persons. A leaflet on human trafficking had been produced in several languages.\\n\\nThe State party was prioritising the ratification of International Labour Organization convention 29 on forced labour. This process was expected to be completed soon. A plan for the prevention of labour exploitation was formulated by the State each year and preventative inspections were carried out twice a year in vulnerable sectors. Employees could file complaints through an online anonymous complaints service, by email or a telephone hotline. The State provided migrant workers with information about their rights.\\n\\nA programme was in place to increase access to medical staff in asylum centres through measures such as the temporary transfer of medical personnel. Around 16,200 refugee students from 70 different countries were enrolled in Greek educational institutions. Case managers trained in the best interests of the child monitored age assessment procedures, which would soon be harmonised across all European Union Member States.\\n\\nGreece had ratified the regional conventions on safety in sport matches and had implemented legislation that prohibited banners at sporting matches with racist or sexist content.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said Greece only formally recognised one minority, Thrace Muslims. Why were other minority groups not recognised as minorities? What data was collected on minorities? How well represented was the Muslim minority in public bodies and in elected roles at national and local levels?\\n\\nWhat outcomes had been achieved by the last national strategy on the inclusion of the Roma and what progress had been made in implementing the current strategy? Were the Roma consulted about policies and strategies that affected them? Roma people reportedly continued to be victims of discrimination in Greece when trying to access healthcare, housing and employment. Many Roma people lived below the poverty threshold and struggled to access basic services. What measures were in place to ensure equal access for Roma children to education and schooling? What measures were in place to improve access to paid employment and quality healthcare for the Roma? Roma often lacked access to heating, running water and toilets. How was the State party preventing forced evictions and fines for illegal construction? Roma people faced long, costly judicial procedures to acquire Greek nationality. How was the State party promoting their access to nationality?\\n\\nThe Committee noted the adoption of several laws and the national strategy in favour of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. However, this community continued to be subjected to discrimination in schools and public services. What measures were in place to tackle such discrimination? What results had the national strategy achieved?\\n\\nThere were reports of migrant women, including pregnant women, having been assaulted by Greek Coast Guards. Greece had the highest rate of femicide in Europe. What measures were in place to address violence against women?\\n\\nWhat statistics did the State party have on people of African descent and their integration in public life? What activities had been undertaken as part of the International Decade for People of African Descent? How was the State party combatting the multiple forms of discrimination faced by this group? What measures were in place to implement the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action? Was there a formal mechanism in place to assess its implementation?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the term \"minority\" in Greece was understood under stricter criteria than those of the Committee. The State party respected the principle of self-identification. Groups of people who were not recognised as a minority enjoyed all rights under the Convention. Four members of the Hellenic Parliament were Muslims, and more than 100 Muslims had been elected to public bodies.\\n\\nThe Roma had expressed the will not to be considered as an ethnic minority. Authorities paid particular attention to this vulnerable group. The State had made the civil registry process easier and more efficient for the Roma. The previous strategy on Roma inclusion provided specific interventions to address early school dropouts and support access to health and housing. Implementation of this strategy was independently reviewed. There were also 85 local action plans on Roma support elaborated with the Roma population. There was an open, independent consultation platform with 13 Roma organizations that met every three months to devise strategies for Roma inclusion.\\n\\nRoma people were eligible for all State welfare benefits. The State party was promoting the Roma\\'s participation in education and the labour market. The public employment service implemented targeted programmes for the Roma, such as 15,000-euro subsidies for Roma who started a business and training and certification in technical jobs.\\n\\nThe Government had taken measures to facilitate the inclusion of Roma children in education. Psychosocial support was provided to vulnerable students in schools. Roma children could be enrolled in schools without official documentation. Teacher training programmes were provided on combatting early school dropouts and supporting Roma children.\\n\\nThe State party did not have records of complaints against Coast Guard officials regarding sexual assault of pregnant women. This year, there had been 12 victims of femicide. The State party had ratified the Istanbul Convention and was collecting data on violence against women and conducting training in schools to raise awareness of the issue. There was a large network of structures for supporting women victims, who had access to emergency accommodation.\\n\\nThe national strategy on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons aimed to combat discrimination and promote equality for these people. All ministries carried out actions supporting these people.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said there were gaps between policies for the Roma and practices. What was the size of the Roma population? What were the causes of femicides in the State party and the ethnic origins of the victims? Had the State party considered making a law on femicide?\\n\\nA Committee Expert said Roma children were being segregated in Greek schools. How many Roma children were participating in and graduating from inclusive public education?\\n\\nFAITH DIKELEDI PANSY TLAKULA, Committee Expert and Follow-Up Rapporteur, said the Committee had previously expressed concern about the poor working conditions of migrant workers in the agricultural sector and the informal economy. What investigations had been carried out into the exploitation of migrant workers and what compensation was provided to victims? Were employers who imposed abusive labour conditions subjected to criminal sanctions? What training was provided to labour inspectors on identifying victims of human trafficking?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said Greece\\'s efforts to preserve its historical monuments were commendable.\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece was home to a vibrant community of people of African descent, many of whom held leading roles in civil society and public organizations. Greece fully supported the pending General Assembly resolution to declare a second International Decade for People of African DescentOpens in new window. The National Council against Racism and Intolerance was implementing measures to support the rights of people of African descent.\\n\\nThere were 120,000 Roma people in Greece, 20,000 of whom received guaranteed minimum income support. To encourage school attendance, families whose children did not attend school did not receive welfare benefits. Investments had been made to improve housing infrastructure in Roma communities.\\n\\nAround 1,600 labour inspections were carried out this year and fines were issued in around 700 cases. Twenty cases had been reported to the Public Prosecutor regarding potential victims of trafficking in persons. Standards had been developed for seasonal housing for migrant workers. The labour inspectorate\\'s staff had been increased recently. All inspectors participated in training on preventing and identifying human trafficking.\\n\\nClosing Remarks\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, thanked the delegation for the dialogue, which had been intensive, fruitful, frank and necessary. The questions raised by the Committee aimed to assess progress in the implementation of the Convention to help the Committee to develop recommendations that were helpful to Greece.\\n\\nIOANNIS GHIKAS, Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said the dialogue had been intense but constructive, identifying issues that the State party needed to address. Greece was proud of the Greek Committee Expert Stamatia Stavrinaki, who was an excellent representative of the tradition of human rights scholarship in Greece. The strong representation of women in the delegation was a representation of the reality in Greece, where promoting women\\'s representation was a high priority. The State was proud of the progress it had made since the last review, including in protecting the rights of asylum seekers and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons.'}, {'topic': 'Race Polarization', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech and racial polarization in social media', 'title': 'The Systemic Abyss', 'url': 'https://djhzeijoyesu.medium.com/the-systemic-abyss-c339ff2b7d74', 'published_date': '2024-12-06T22:02:51Z', 'source': 'Medium', 'content': 'This paper examines the profound historical, psychological, and social implications of the racial slur \"nigger,\" advocating for its abolition as a symbol of systemic oppression and moral degradation. By contrasting the prohibition of prayer in secular systems with the tolerance of this slur, the paper critiques the inadequacies of current structural frameworks in addressing systemic injustice. It further explores how language shapes societal norms and proposes a framework for rethinking linguistic accountability, with a focus on scientific and sociological research. The paper concludes by recommending legislative, cultural, and educational strategies to eradicate this term, emphasizing its potential to serve as a precedent for combating other forms of hate speech.\\n\\nLanguage is a powerful tool for constructing reality. Words have the ability to heal, inspire, harm, or dehumanize. Few words encapsulate this duality as starkly as the racial slur \"nigger.\" Originating in colonial times as a means of dehumanizing African-descended individuals, this word persists as a vestige of slavery and systemic racism. While the global community recognizes hate speech as a moral and legal offense, this particular term remains paradoxically present in cultural and societal contexts. This paper explores why its abolition is necessary, examining systemic contradictions such as the prohibition of prayer in secular institutions, which reflects inconsistent applications of societal norms.\\n\\nThe word \"nigger\" is not merely a slur; it is a linguistic artifact of oppression. Its use was instrumental in the transatlantic slave trade, serving to justify inhuman treatment and the commodification of Black individuals. Even post-slavery, its usage perpetuated psychological trauma and reinforced systemic segregation. This section will:\\n\\nDiscuss its transition into contemporary usage, including its appropriation in some cultural contexts.\\n\\n2.1 Psychological and Sociological Impacts\\n\\nNumerous studies document the detrimental effects of slurs on mental health, self-perception, and societal cohesion. This section will review research on how such language perpetuates stereotypes, normalizes violence, and undermines equality.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3. The Structural Contradictions of Language and Law\\n\\n3.1 Prohibition of Prayer vs. Tolerance of Slurs\\n\\nModern secular systems often prohibit religious expression, such as prayer, in public spaces to maintain neutrality. However, the tolerance or legal protection of hate speech like \"nigger\" reveals a profound inconsistency. This section will:\\n\\nAnalyze legal frameworks governing free speech and hate speech.\\n\\nContrast the treatment of spiritual expressions and harmful language.\\n\\nExamine the ethical implications of these inconsistencies.\\n\\n3.2 Systemic Inadequacies\\n\\nThe persistence of this slur highlights structural failures in addressing racism. These include:\\n\\nEducational deficits in teaching about historical racism.\\n\\n4.1 Linguistic Accountability and Societal Health\\n\\nLanguage shapes cultural norms and individual behaviors. Allowing derogatory terms like \"nigger\" to persist undermines societal progress. Abolition serves not only as a symbolic act but as a practical step toward dismantling systemic racism.\\n\\n4.2 International Precedents\\n\\nCountries like Germany have outlawed Nazi symbols and hate speech to prevent the perpetuation of oppressive ideologies. This section will analyze these precedents and their applicability to abolishing the word \"nigger.\"\\n\\n4.3 Practical Strategies for Abolition\\n\\nLegislation: Enacting laws to classify the word as hate speech subject to penalties.\\n\\nCultural Transformation: Promoting alternative narratives and redefining societal values through media and art.\\n\\nEducation: Developing curricula that address the history and harm of this word.\\n\\nPrayer, often prohibited in secular systems, represents spiritual and personal empowerment. Its suppression contrasts sharply with the permissibility of language that dehumanizes. This section examines:\\n\\nThe role of prayer in fostering social cohesion and personal resilience.\\n\\nThe systemic bias in prioritizing secular neutrality over human dignity.\\n\\nHow addressing such contradictions can strengthen structural justice.\\n\\nThis paper proposes a unified framework to address linguistic and structural inequities:\\n\\nRestorative Justice: Encouraging reparative dialogue and reconciliation.\\n\\nLegislative Reform: Balancing free speech with protections against harm.\\n\\nGlobal Solidarity: Collaborating across cultures to combat hate speech.\\n\\nThe abolition of the word \"nigger\" represents a critical step in addressing systemic racism and linguistic harm. By treating its usage as a form of societal profligation subject to severe penalties, we signal a commitment to justice and equity. Contrasting this with the prohibition of prayer reveals deep systemic contradictions, underscoring the need for comprehensive reform. A future free of such dehumanizing language is possible through legislative action, cultural transformation, and education.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe word \"nigger\" holds a unique and deeply traumatic position in the history of racial oppression, symbolizing systemic racism and violence. Despite occasional reappropriation within Black communities, its continued use outside these contexts perpetuates harm, discrimination, and psychological trauma. This paper contrasts the societal prohibition of \"prayer\" in certain public or governmental spaces with the tolerated use of racial slurs, highlighting structural inconsistencies. By drawing from historical, psychological, and legal perspectives, this study advocates for the abolition of such language through strict societal and legal frameworks.\\n\\nHistorical Context and Systemic Impacts\\n\\nThe n-word\\'s origin as a tool of dehumanization dates back to slavery and segregation, where it was a prelude to violence, including lynching and other atrocities. Its persistence symbolizes a system that normalizes anti-Blackness and undermines societal equity. Scholars have identified the word as \"the atomic bomb of racial slurs,\" reflecting its uniquely destructive psychological and societal impact. The term reinforces systemic racism by perpetuating stereotypes and fostering environments where discrimination thrives (sources: ADL, Psychology Today).\\n\\nLegal and Psychological Perspectives\\n\\nThe legal system inconsistently addresses hate speech and racial slurs. While hate crimes laws penalize acts motivated by bias, proving intent remains challenging. The n-word often functions as a trigger for violence, demonstrating its potent psychological effects. Studies show that exposure to racial slurs can cause enduring trauma, influencing behaviors and mental health over time (sources: OHCHR, OJP, Psychology Today).\\n\\nStructural Inadequacies: Prayer vs. Hate Speech\\n\\nContrasting the restriction of prayer in public institutions with the leniency towards racial slurs highlights systemic contradictions. Prayer is often prohibited in contexts aiming to uphold neutrality and prevent marginalization. However, the tolerance of racial epithets undermines this neutrality by tacitly endorsing harm against marginalized groups. This inconsistency reveals a structural failure to equitably protect individual dignity and safety.\\n\\nRecommendations\\n\\n1. Abolition Through Legislation: Strengthen hate speech laws to explicitly include the prohibition of racial slurs, with penalties reflecting their societal harm.\\n\\n2. Education and Awareness: Implement educational initiatives to address the history and impact of such language, emphasizing its role in systemic oppression.\\n\\n3. Community Empowerment: Support the reappropriation of language within marginalized communities while discouraging its use by others to prevent perpetuation of harm.\\n\\n4. Structural Reforms: Address systemic biases in policy-making that tolerate harmful language while restricting other forms of expression.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe systemic tolerance of racial slurs like the n-word is a manifestation of structural racism that undermines societal progress. Abolishing such language requires a comprehensive approach involving legal, educational, and social reforms. Addressing this issue not only honors the dignity of those affected but also strengthens the moral and ethical fabric of society.\\n\\nIn the sprawling labyrinth of systemic governance, where laws claim to safeguard dignity and equality, a glaring hypocrisy festers. On one hand, institutions silence prayer -- a quiet invocation of hope, unity, and introspection -- under the guise of secular neutrality. On the other, these same systems shield hate speech, particularly the visceral linguistic weaponry of the word \"nigger,\" cloaking its use in the sanctity of \"free expression.\" This contradiction is not a mere oversight but a seismic failure of moral and structural integrity. The persistence of this slur serves as an indictment of the inadequacies of modern systems, exposing their complicity in perpetuating oppression while masquerading as bastions of liberty.\\n\\n1. Prayer: Silenced Benevolence\\n\\nPrayer, an act of spiritual alignment and communal solace, is systematically expunged from public spaces to uphold secularism. This prohibition is framed as essential to protecting inclusivity, yet it suppresses a harmless, often uplifting practice. The rationale behind this exclusion betrays a fear of offense, yet paradoxically, it allows offensive language -- rooted in hate -- to flourish unchecked.\\n\\n2. The N-Word: Protected Oppression\\n\\nThe n-word, a verbal relic of slavery\\'s barbarity, survives as a cultural anomaly: a word so potent in its dehumanization that it continues to wound across generations. Protected by laws intended to defend expression, it has become a totem of systemic hypocrisy. By tolerating its usage, societies tacitly endorse its underlying ideology -- one that denies humanity and perpetuates racial hierarchies.\\n\\nSanctifying Harm, Criminalizing Hope\\n\\nThe double standard between prayer and slurs unmasks a systemic prioritization of abstract ideals over tangible harm. Prayer, which often fosters connection and resilience, is suppressed as potentially divisive, while slurs, which undeniably fracture the social fabric, are tolerated. This prioritization reveals a skewed moral compass, where the avoidance of ideological discomfort supersedes the protection of human dignity.\\n\\nLegal Contradictions as a Disgrace\\n\\nSecular laws punish expressions of spirituality to preserve neutrality, yet they fail to curtail language explicitly designed to oppress. This contradiction underscores the inadequacy of frameworks that claim to champion equality while upholding structural inequities.\\n\\n1. Legislative Abolition of Hate Speech\\n\\nSocieties must confront their linguistic relics with unflinching clarity. Laws should eradicate racial slurs from public lexicons, treating them as instruments of psychological violence. This abolition would signal a decisive rejection of systemic racism.\\n\\n2. Cultural Renaissance\\n\\nA cultural movement is needed to reclaim linguistic spaces from the shadows of oppression. Through art, education, and public discourse, society must dismantle the normalized violence of slurs while redefining speech as a tool for justice, not harm.\\n\\n3. Reframing Freedom\\n\\nTrue freedom lies not in the unchecked license to harm but in the empowerment of individuals to coexist with dignity. Reframing freedom as responsibility would enable societies to prioritize collective well-being over the preservation of outdated and oppressive norms.\\n\\nThe systemic tolerance of the n-word, juxtaposed with the prohibition of prayer, symbolizes a deep moral chasm. This inconsistency is not just a structural flaw but a betrayal of justice itself. To reclaim societal integrity, we must uproot these double standards and construct frameworks that honor the intrinsic worth of every individual. The abolition of hateful language is not an attack on freedom but its ultimate affirmation -- a visionary step toward a future where words heal rather than harm.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

But we have been engaged in a decades-long, deeply illiberal experiment in policing 'hate speech' - which is now making us an international laughing stock.\\n\\nThe offence of inciting racial hatred, of which Pearson was accused, was first created in Britain in 1965, with the passage of the Race Relations Act. This notion that it was the role of the state to define and police hatred - that, in essence, censorship was our path to racial harmony - was enshrined in law and elite culture.\\n\\nThis sits in stark contrast to the United States. It was in the 1960s - amid the civil-rights revolution, the bottom-up demand from black Americans for their rights - that the expansive free-speech protections Americans now enjoy were won. Until then, the First Amendment had essentially been a dead letter - gifted by the Founders but never enforced in practice.\\n\\nThe project of speech policing and thought control was embraced enthusiastically by Tony Blair's government. In 2006, the then New Labour government passed the Racial and Religious Hatred Act, introducing the offence of 'incitement to religious hatred'. Were it not for a successful campaign to rein in that legislation, led by comedian Rowan Atkinson, it would have criminalised 'abusive or insulting' language about religion, too.\\n\\nBut arguably Blair's more consequential contribution to 'hate speech' legislation came with the Communications Act of 2003. Under Section 127 of this law, it is illegal to send 'by means of a public electronic-communications network a message or other matter that is grossly offensive'. While this was an update on a pre-existing telecoms offence, it made it match fit for the digital age.\\n\\nIndeed, the combination of Britain's already-repressive speech laws and the dawn of the social-media era proved to be a disastrous mix - particularly for the nation's more obnoxious young people. In the early 2010s, there were a slew of cases in which teenagers and university students were sent to prison for saying stupid, outrageous and often downright despicable things on social media. Often while drunk.\\n\\nIn 2012, Swansea student Liam Stacey was convicted of a racially aggravated public-order offence over racist tweets he posted after Bolton Wanderers footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed from a heart attack during a match. Stacey was sentenced to 56 days in prison.\\n\\nThat same year, teenager Matthew Woods was jailed for three months for a string of 'grossly offensive' Facebook posts about missing young girls April Jones and Madeleine McCann. While inebriated, at a friend's house, Woods began his tirade by copying, pasting and sharing sick jokes from the website 'Sickipedia'.\\n\\nThere was also Jake Newsome, given six weeks in prison in 2014 for saying on Facebook that he was 'glad' that a Leeds teacher had been murdered by a pupil. And there was 20-year-old Azhar Ahmed, fined £300 and ordered to do community service for posting, again on Facebook, that 'all soldiers should die and go to hell'.\\n\\nThe investigations, arrests and even convictions for online speech reached well beyond genuine bigots and trolls. Telling jokes became a risky business. Famously, Paul Chambers was found guilty in 2010 of sending a 'menacing electronic communication' for an obvious joke on Twitter, threatening to blow Robin Hood Airport 'sky high', after he was infuriated to find out it was closed.\\n\\nAs the trans issue came into view, it became clear that even mainstream opinions - such as not believing that men can become women - could also be rebranded as 'hateful' by our increasingly identitarian authorities.\\n\\nGender-critical feminist Kate Scottow was arrested in 2018 for causing 'needless anxiety' after she persistently called a man 'he' on social media. It was overturned on appeal. Christian preacher David McConnell similarly had to be tried and convicted before the courts realised 'misgendering' isn't actually a crime. Not yet, at least.\\n\\nNot only did those supposedly freedom-loving Conservatives do nothing during their 14 years in power to repeal any of this censorious legislation, they actually made things worse. They passed the Online Safety Act, which incentivises Big Tech firms to censor speech and introduced new and updated communications offences.\\n\\nFollowing the horrifying race riots that exploded across England this past summer, there were a string of convictions for inciting hatred and posting 'grossly offensive' material. A Romanian man was also convicted of a 'false communication' offence - under the new Online Safety Act, no less - for posting a video of himself pretending to flee from a far-right mob.\"}, {'topic': 'Race Polarization', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech and racial polarization in social media', 'title': 'Police investigating journalist over post recorded 1,500', 'url': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14100397/police-investigating-journalist-online-post-non-crime-hate-incidents.html', 'published_date': '2024-11-19T11:03:41Z', 'source': 'Daily Mail Online', 'content': \"Police investigating a journalist for allegedly inciting racial hatred in a year-old online post have recorded 1,500 non-crime hate incidents in just two years.\\n\\nEssex Police has faced criticism for investigating Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson over a tweet that was posted, and then quickly deleted, last year.\\n\\nAccording to The Times, a freedom of information response revealed that the force logged 702 non-crime hate incidents (NCHIs) between June 2023 and June 2024 and 834 in the 12 months before that.\\n\\nOne of the 'suspects' recorded on the force's hate incident database was a shopkeeper who refused a person entry to his shop because they had a guide dog with them.\\n\\nAnother complaint was logged when a civilian said they felt their bank was being difficult with them due to their 'skin colour and height'.\\n\\nEssex Police has been condemned for its actions by critics including former prime minister Boris Johnson after Ms Pearson was not told the specific focus of the enquiry when officers arrived on her doorstep on Remembrance Sunday.\\n\\nMs Pearson said the policemen at her door said they were investigating a 'non-crime hate incident'.

Eventually, more than 250 community leaders and citizens in Franklin and Adams counties in Pennsylvania signed on.\\n\\nThis effort - part of a project focused on preventing political violence run by the nonprofit group Urban Rural Action, or UR Action - almost fell apart over an argument over including the word \"insurrection.\"\\n\\nIndeed, words have become contentious on the American political landscape.

And they provide politicians with fuel to stoke the flames of polarization.\\n\\nAn anthropologist, I have long studied international political violence and its prevention.

In their view, he added, Trump\\'s rally near the White House was a largely peaceful \"protest\" hijacked by a small number of violent people who stormed the Capitol.\\n\\nMore broadly, many Trump voters believe that the president-elect is the victim of \"lawfare,\" meaning efforts to unjustly use laws to attack political opponents.\\n\\nAs evidence, some Trump supporters point to the defeat of both of his impeachments and various criminal court cases brought against Trump, most of which have been paused or dismissed after he won the 2024 election.\\n\\n\"Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\"\\n\\nAttack ads that feature phrases like this don\\'t necessarily win elections.\\n\\nBut gender identity was a nonstop talking point at the dozen or so MAGA events I attended ahead of the election. Speakers there constantly mocked the use of nonbinary pronouns and blasted the \"radical left\" for \"transgender insanity.\" This \"insanity,\" in their view, includes issues such as transgender people using bathrooms that match their gender identity and participating in sports competitions.\\n\\nThe word \"equity\" - along with related terms such as \"diversity,\" \"critical race theory,\" \"social justice,\" \"privilege\" and \"DEI,\" short for \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" - can also anger a Trump supporter.\\n\\nThey associate these words with a \"woke\" or even \"communist\" agenda that they think the \"radical left\" is trying to impose on them.\\n\\nWhile some people think that these terms speak to efforts to recognize that groups of marginalized people, including people of color and women, have long faced discrimination, many Trump supporters think that related \"woke\" policies threaten their free speech and individual and family rights.\\n\\nTrump supporters were called \"deplorables\" by former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.\\n\\nBut my interviews and observations show that no word, not even \"fascist,\" stings Trump supporters as much as being called a \"racist,\" an accusation that is widely used against them.\\n\\nAs Matt Schlapp, the head of the conservative group Conservative Political Action Committee, which runs the annual CPAC conference, laments in a book, \"There is no way to escape its putrid stink.\" The \"racist\" label, Schlapp explains from experience, shames, stigmatizes and makes a person afraid to speak.\\n\\nMore broadly, the use of \"racist\" and related terms plays into many Trump voters\\' perceptions and anger that Democrats are elitist liberals who they think look down upon and even hate them.\\n\\nTrump and Republican influencers frequently play on this resentment. Trump, for example, wore an orange and yellow safety vest as he sat in a garbage truck after Biden referred to them as \"garbage.\" Trump\\'s supporters soon started wearing vests and even garbage bags to his preelection events to show their support for Trump.\\n\\nNo one, however, wore a shirt to a Trump rally emblazoned with the word \"racist.\"\\n\\nAmerica\\'s political division is intertwined with how language - sometimes a single word - can be understood differently by liberals and conservatives and trigger a negative reaction.\\n\\nThis reality has policy implications.\\n\\nFor example, when Philanthropy for Active Civic Engagement, an organization seeking to enhance civic and democratic life, examined perceptions of civic terms starting in 2019, they found that using certain works such as \"equity\" is often perceived as \"liberal and college educated.\" Their survey found that conservatives view terms such as \"diversity,\" \"social justice,\" \"racial equity\" and \"activism\" much more negatively than liberals.\\n\\nThese findings have led organizations that try to decrease political polarization in the U.S. to modify their messaging and more often use terms such as \"unity,\" \"citizens\" and \"liberty,\" which the civics language study found appeals to both liberals and conservatives.\\n\\nWords don\\'t just provoke, then. They can also provide a path forward.\\n\\nAs the saying goes, \"Words are like bees; some create honey, but others leave a sting.\"'}, {'topic': 'Race Polarization', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech and racial polarization in social media', 'title': \"Police probing the 'name Leonard' as a 'hate' incident\", 'url': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14112601/Police-probing-child-classmate-smelled-fish-Rottweiler-Leonard-hate-incidents.html', 'published_date': '2024-11-22T02:10:55Z', 'source': 'Daily Mail Online', 'content': \"Police forces have been blasted for investigating 'hate crimes' that include calling someone a Rottweiler or being called a 'Leonard' over a row about a hedge.\\n\\nNCHIs are meant to be recorded for incidents 'clearly motivated by intentional hostility' and where there is a genuine risk of significant escalation, government guidance says.\\n\\nBut the police have been accused of wasting 'valuable time' on investigating so-called hate crimes such as an 'aggressively-administered haircut' instead of 'real crime'.\\n\\nOne former Met detective said it the situation is 'ridiculous', adding: 'No wonder there is a crimewave in this country.'\\n\\nCases of reported hate crime include a Lithuanian customer who was unhappy with their haircut claimed it was done deliberately because he spoke Russian and the barber was allegedly 'aggressive and rough' as a result.\\n\\nIn one case, a German woman was likened to a Rottweiler in a parking dispute.\\n\\nIn another police were told someone had been homophobic because they referred to someone as a 'Leonard' in a row over a hedge.\\n\\nOfficers have also recorded incidents against children, such as one who called a fellow primary school pupil a 'retard', and against two schoolgirls who said another student smelled 'like fish'.\\n\\nShadow Home Secretary Chris Philp said: 'This nonsense undermines confidence in policing'\\n\\nAllison Pearson (pictured) is accused of stirring up racial hatred in a post on social media\\n\\nPolice forces have been blasted for investigating 'hate crimes' that include calling someone a Rottweiler or being called a 'Leonard' over a row about a hedge.

The State party had taken significant initiatives to combat racial discrimination, including by implementing the national action plan on preventing racism and intolerance, laws combatting hate speech, and training programmes for law enforcement officials. The State party had also adopted a national action plan on preventing anti-Semitism and had made efforts to promote the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, including by implementing legislation on same-sex marriage.\\n\\nProgress had been made despite the decade-long economic crisis that Greece had been facing. The racist \"Golden Dawn\" organization had been banned from participating in political activities and its leaders had been imprisoned. Civil society continued to support the State party\\'s efforts to prevent racism and intolerance. There was much work to be done, but Greece was committed to addressing the issues it faced, and looked forward to the recommendations of the Committee.\\n\\nAIKATERINI PATSOGIANNI, Secretary General of Equality and Human Rights, Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family Affairs of Greece and head of the delegation, said that since the last review, Greece had been advancing toward long-term sustainable economic progress, supporting its human rights and anti-racism framework. In the fight against racism, police authorities had developed standards and guidance in areas such as training and capacity building of law enforcement, improved recording and collection of data on hate crimes, as well as cooperation between law enforcement and civil society organizations, and ways to address underreporting. The judicial system responded to organizations that exploited the economic crisis and the resulting fractures to the social fabric to commit criminal racist acts, while the legislature took measures to protect and safeguard the democratic electoral process from such criminal organizations.\\n\\nThe National Council against Racism and Intolerance, in which independent bodies also participated, adopted its first national action plan in December 2020. Efforts for the second action plan were underway, with funding secured for a results-driven agenda. In this regard, the State party was ready to work with relevant stakeholders, including the Racist Violence Recording Network.\\n\\nGreece was actively implementing the National Strategy on the Roma 2021-2030, guided by the principle of \"for the Roma, with the Roma.\" Key committees, including the independent Roma Forum, were fully operational. All available European Union funding was used to enhance the Roma\\'s employment, education, healthcare and housing.\\n\\nOn migration, modernised reception facilities ensured dignified conditions and targeted care for vulnerable groups, while a robust system supported unaccompanied minors. The Asylum Service had significantly improved in efficiency. The \"HELIOS\" project and legal reforms promoted integration and labour market access. Enhanced international cooperation also provided pathways for organised, legal migration.\\n\\nBorder protection was carried out in line with domestic, European and international law. Protecting human life at sea and aiding those in distress, without any form of discrimination, was the highest duty of the Hellenic Coast Guard. Allegations of violations of the principle of non-refoulement were inconsistent with the operational activities of the competent agencies. The State had put in place a multi-level policy for the effective monitoring of fundamental rights. The Hellenic Coast Guard had saved and continued to save thousands of lives at sea.\\n\\nGreece had ratified International Labour Organization Convention 190 to create a work environment free from violence and harassment. Public authorities detected and protected all trafficking victims, without discrimination, in line with the principles of the Office of the National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings and the National Referral Mechanism.\\n\\nInclusive education was promoted through various initiatives and teacher training programmes. Key efforts included the \"Active Citizens\\' Actions\" curriculum supporting the Sustainable Development Goals, a 2023 anti-bullying law with a reporting platform, a mobile phone ban to reduce cyberbullying, and the introduction of \"Digital School\" and \"Skills Lab\" to enhance digital learning.\\n\\nThe State party had also established an independent Committee of Deontology, aimed at countering all types of expression in printed and electronic media that incited, promoted, spread or justified violence, hatred or discriminatory speech. Human rights education, training and awareness-raising activities, including for law enforcement personnel and members of the judiciary, remained top priorities.\\n\\nQuestions by a Committee Expert\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, thanked Greece for supporting the candidacy of Greek Expert Stamatia Stavrinaki to the Committee, who made remarkable contributions to its work.\\n\\nCould the delegation provide information on the ethnic makeup of the population and of asylum seekers and refugees living in the State party? The Committee was concerned by the general lack of disaggregated data on racial discrimination. What measures were in place to implement a comprehensive data collection system?\\n\\nWhat measures had the State party taken to address excessive use of force by the police? There had been several allegations of such excessive use of force against minorities. How was the State party ensuring that all allegations were properly investigated, perpetrators punished, and victims granted reparations?\\n\\nThere was a limited number of convictions for cases involving racial discrimination and official data on cases reported to the police was not accessible to the public. The Committee was concerned that the new anti-racist law was not fully in line with the requirements of article four of the Convention as it did not criminalise the dissemination of ideas of racial superiority or prohibit racist organizations. What measures were in place to revise legislation to ensure that all incitement to racial, ethnic and religious hatred was criminalised and that perpetrators were punished? How had the police\\'s capacity to investigate racist crimes and to combat racist violence been increased? State services reportedly did not provide appropriate, timely support to victims of racist violence, who relied on support from civil society. Was a referral system for victims to State services being developed?\\n\\nOver the reporting period, there had been 89 reported cases of racism targeting asylum seekers and refugees. The Committee welcomed the various legislative measures undertaken to address racism. Were there gaps in the implementation of legislation on racism? Was there a media regulatory body that held journalists to account when they disseminated racist notions?\\n\\nWas the State party drafting a new national action plan to combat racism and intolerance? What results had the last action plan achieved? The National Council against Racism and Intolerance had been reactivated in 2024. What measures were in place to ensure that the Council could work effectively?\\n\\nWhy had there been delays in the registration of civil society organizations claiming to have minority status? Some minority associations had been dissolved; could the delegation comment on this?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece did not collect statistical data based on race and religious affiliations due to its protection of the right to privacy. Statistical data was collected on specific categories of beneficiaries of State policies, such as policies for the Roma. Data was also collected on the demographics of prison inmates, and on migrants, asylum seekers and refugees according to European Union regulations. A unified information system for reception and asylum was being developed. Data on migrants\\' gender, ethnicity and religion was collected.\\n\\nAfter 2015, there was an amendment to legislation concerning the punishment of hate crimes that facilitated the investigation and prosecution of cases by eliminating the need to prove the standard of \"hate\". Data from the judiciary and the Public Prosecutor showed that there had been better implementation of hate crime legislation in recent years. The State party also had legislation on hate speech and incitement to hatred that addressed speech inciting racial superiority.\\n\\n\"Golden Dawn\" was not allowed to participate in elections and State funding to it had been suspended. All political parties that acted as proxies for persons who had committed racist hate crimes were prohibited, and on this basis two political parties had recently been banned from participating in elections.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said human rights defenders were sometimes accused and condemned without having the opportunity to defend themselves. Did the State party intend to adopt special legislation to protect human rights defenders? Several dozens of cases of refoulement involving Greece had been examined by the European Court of Human Rights. Were border police trained on the handling of migrants? What aid had been provided to victims of police violence?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said that although the European Union directive on victim support had been incorporated into national legislation, there were allegations that the directive was not sufficiently applied, leading to impunity for perpetrators of racist acts. How did the State party collect data on foreign nationals in the prison system? What recommendations had been provided by the Racist Violence Reporting Network to the State and had these been implemented?\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert asked about the effectiveness of State policies. How many of the cases of police misconduct reported had resulted in sanctions? How many committees reviewing journalistic ethics had members of racial minority groups?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece had permitted the reopening of domestic court proceedings after decisions on three cases by the European Court of Human Rights. A committee of independent experts had been established to develop strategies for the implementation of the European Court\\'s decisions.\\n\\nPolice personnel were obliged to respect human rights and perform their duties based on respect for individuals. They needed to avoid prejudice based on distinguishing characteristics. The Hellenic Police transmitted relevant information to an independent Ombudsman concerning cases involving discrimination. Over 1,000 cases of police misdemeanours had been conveyed to the Ombudsman, and around 660 disciplinary sanctions had been implemented. Several cases related to racist actions by the police.\\n\\nThe law on audiovisual media services prohibited the dissemination of hate speech based on race and other characteristics. The National Media Advisory Authority had the competence to impose sanctions for disseminating hate speech through online and offline media. All print and online media needed to meet requirements related to the Journalistic Code of Ethics, which included prohibitions of hate speech. The Journalistic Ethics Committee was mandated to investigate all allegations of discriminatory speech. Its members were not appointed based on their ethnicity or sex but were journalists and academics.\\n\\nIn Greece, persons with low income could apply for free legal aid. Legal aid was also provided to victims in trafficking cases and to female victims of violence. Measures were in place to protect victims from secondary victimisation in legal proceedings. All victims were informed of their rights, including the right to compensation.\\n\\nThe Greek legislative framework did not have a specific law for the protection of human rights defenders; all persons were equal before the law.\\n\\nPrivate funding of political parties was strictly forbidden in Greece. Only State funding was legal for political parties. This was why State funding had been suspended for parties that engaged in hate crimes and hate speech.\\n\\nQuestions by a Committee Expert\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said not all incidents of racism were reported by victims, allegedly due to a lack of confidence in the authorities. What measures were in place to strengthen confidence in the justice system among citizens? Did the State party intend to establish an efficient data collection system on racist violence? How would it promote access to justice for victims of racial discrimination? How many complaints of racist hate speech and hate crimes had been received by the State and how many perpetrators had been prosecuted? In how many court cases had the Convention been cited? What measures had the State party taken to encourage the participation of civil society in the implementation of the Convention? Racism continued to be prevalent in the Attica region and in centres where refugees and asylum seekers were located. Did the State party intend to accept the Committee\\'s communications procedure?\\n\\nDiscrimination against minorities by authorities persisted. What recent educational initiatives had been implemented to combat intolerance and prejudice and promote intercultural dialogue? The State party had received the Global Education Award for establishing the Skills Lab, which promoted ethnic tolerance. Was this implemented in all regions of the State party and at all levels?\\n\\nThe Committee commended the State party for its efforts to create memorials of the Holocaust. There were 158 attacks based on religion recorded in 2023. What measures were in place to ensure efficient investigations of these incidents and to develop protection measures? There had also been an increase in cases of vandalism of religious sites and profanation in recent years. What measures were in place to put an end to these practices?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the police code of conduct required police to act with empathy toward vulnerable people. The State party collected data on hate speech and hate crimes, including data on racially motivated crimes.\\n\\nIn Greek prisons, data was collected on nationality. Foreigners from 101 nationalities made up 50 per cent of the prison population. These were persons who were convicted and serving these sentences in Greek prisons. Greece was on the crossroads of many routes, and many people in prisons in Greece were engaged in cross-border criminal activity.\\n\\nThe Ombudsperson received discrimination complaints. Racial discrimination complaints made up seven per cent of complaints received in 2023, up from two per cent in 2022. The labour inspectorate examined complaints of workplace discrimination. The inspectorate was empowered to instigate administrative sanctions. Three cases it investigated in 2023 involved discrimination on the grounds of nationality.\\n\\nThe police had established specialised departments to address violent hate crimes and hate speech and provide support to victims in Attica and the Eastern Aegean region. A hotline and online form for reporting hate crimes had been implemented, and several campaigns were underway on online hate speech. The police force was cooperating with civil society, which provided training to upgrade the capacities of police staff.\\n\\nThe Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure had been revised to make them more victim centred. Courts had been redistributed to improve citizens\\' access across the State. Domestic violence legislation had also been modernised.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, asked for statistics on victims of discrimination who had benefitted from free legal aid. There was a large gap between the records of racist violence of the Racist Violence Reporting NetworkOpens in new window and the Government. Why was this? On what basis was the second national action plan on addressing racism being devised?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said that it was quite shocking that 50 per cent of prisoners in Greece were non-nationals.\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert said that the State\\'s regulations on the provision of legal aid appeared to limit access to it. Would it consider implementing a system of reviewing all requests for legal aid, regardless of the type of crime?\\n\\nA Committee Expert asked whether the labour inspectorate assigned fines for workplace discrimination. Why were non-nationals in Attica most impacted by racist crimes? How did the State party apply the recommendations of the Racist Violence Reporting Network? The Expert welcomed the guide on reporting hate crimes. Were victims made aware of this guide?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the national action plan against racism and intolerance focused on addressing hate crimes, empowering minorities, and eliminating discrimination based on various characteristics. One key initiative was the guide for victims on reporting hate crimes, which had been translated into nine languages and distributed to migrant reception centres and published online. Several training activities had been held to improve State authorities\\' response to hate crimes.\\n\\nThe National Council against Racism and Intolerance had held meetings with civil society to develop the second national action plan on addressing racism and intolerance. It had secured funding to improve victims\\' access to State services. The Council would review the Committee\\'s recommendations and include them in the second national action plan, which would focus on strengthening data collection on hate crimes and developing more services for victims.\\n\\nThe Skills Lab initiative had been piloted nationwide. New curricula promoted human rights education and intercultural communication. Training courses were offered for teachers on human rights and inclusion. A digital platform for reporting school bullying and violence had been launched. As of April 2024, over 700 reports had been received, 10 per cent of which related to racism.\\n\\nVarious actions had been taken to provide education about the Holocaust. Greece was one of the first countries to return the property of victims of the Holocaust. The State collected data on vandalism of religious sites. In 2015, 147 cases were recorded.\\n\\nThe procedure for applying for free legal aid was very simple. Applicants needed only to supply documents proving that they had low income. Victims of almost all crimes could apply for this aid. Lawyers could be appointed for defendants in serious crimes with punishments of five years imprisonment or more.\\n\\nOn some occasions, victims of racist violence went to the Racist Violence Reporting Network but not to public authorities. In 2023, 115 cases had been opened by authorities. There was not a big gap between the number of cases collected by authorities and by the Network. More than half of the population lived in Attica. This was why most racist crimes were reported in this region.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said 18 per cent of asylum camp residents did not enjoy basic material conditions, including food and financial assistance. There were only 29 doctors, 92 nurses and 69 interpreters deployed across all the camps, some of which had more than 1,000 residents. What measures were in place to improve the situation in the camps and ensure that the detention of foreign nationals was only done as a last resort? How was the State party ensuring access to interpretation services for foreign nationals? What efforts had been made to develop a statelessness establishment procedure? How was the State party addressing barriers to refugees accessing official documents?\\n\\nWhat steps had been taken to investigate alleged violations of human rights in the context of border management and to prevent such violations? Was there regular independent surveillance of border forces and efforts to strengthen their capacity? Since March 2020, a significant deterioration had been noted in the security and safety of persons from third countries seeking asylum in the east of Greece. There had been reports of summary forced return of persons who had entered from Türkiye, secret detention without sufficient safeguards, confiscation of personal effects, and intrusive searches. There were also reports of private individuals towing and removing engines from asylum seekers\\' boats, and assisting officials in carrying out forced returns.\\n\\nGreece had not signed the statelessness convention and the Presidential decree on the statelessness determination procedure had not been promulgated. Around 3,740 people in Greece had stated that they had no nationality. What measures would the State party take to better address the issue of statelessness?\\n\\nThe Committee had previously expressed concern regarding low salaries and long working hours for migrant workers, particularly in the agricultural sector. What measures were in place to improve the situation of migrant workers? Was there a safe and accessible way of filing complaints related to workplace discrimination? What measures were in place to support undocumented migrants and protect them from trafficking and forced labour?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said seminars on human rights and diversity had been provided for over 1,600 public servants. Seminars had been held on the Holocaust for members of the Orthodox Church of Greece and on the basic principles of Islam for prison officers. Over 160 integrity advisors had also been trained and certified to support integrity in the public service. The national school of the judiciary provided mandatory training on human rights, gender-based violence and other topics. In 2024, 15 seminars had been planned for judges and 12 for court staff.\\n\\nGreece directly implemented the Convention in domestic law, which was why court decisions did not directly reference the Convention.\\n\\nIf infringements of labour laws were found, labour inspectors could impose administrative sanctions and fines, and file serious cases of non-compliance with the Prosecutor.\\n\\nRefugee children could enrol in reception classes without documentation. Language classes were offered for students after school hours. Educational guides assisted teachers in making refugee students feel welcome and safe.\\n\\nGreece was facing challenges with the arrival of third country nationals seeking to enter Europe through Türkiye. It had accelerated asylum procedures through the digitisation of asylum procedures. Health care insurance and tax identification numbers were provided to asylum seekers, who could access employment and healthcare throughout the State.\\n\\nOne of the main priorities of Greece\\'s migration policy was to improve asylum conditions. Case managers carried out rapid assessments of new arrivals\\' needs. Vulnerable persons were provided with specialised protection. More interpreters were being provided in collaboration with various public and private organizations and civil society. The \"HELIOS\" integration system offered support to refugees to access the labour market, health and education. Another initiative was specifically focused on providing language, vocational and intercultural training to refugees seeking to enter the job market.\\n\\nMigration legislation had been amended to reduce the number of migrants in informal employment. An agreement had been reached with Egypt on the provision of temporary employment to Egyptian citizens in the agricultural sector. An agreement was also reached with Bangladeshi citizens to improve access to formal employment. These agreements reenforced legal pathways to migration.\\n\\nThe average time taken to process asylum applications was now 100 days; formerly processing took years. Greece collaborated with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to develop a new system of naturalisation that was fairer for refugees and stateless persons. Around 55 applications for Greek citizenship had been received; only 16 were still pending, citizenship had been granted for the rest.\\n\\nPolice had circulated guidelines on the protection of the fundamental rights of refugees arriving in the State. No third country national was to be returned until their asylum application had been processed.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said violence and excessive use of force had been reported in asylum centres. Could the delegation comment on this? Mr. Diaby congratulated the State party on efforts to formalise the status of stateless persons. Did the State party intend to ratify the statelessness convention? How was the State party responding to racist incidents in sport?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert asked about the results of the human rights education strategies implemented by the State.\\n\\nFAITH DIKELEDI PANSY TLAKULA, Committee Expert and Follow-Up Rapporteur, said the Committee had previously recommended that the State party provide training to teachers on providing education to migrant children, ensure individual assessment of asylum applications, and protect against refoulement. What efforts had been made to improve migrants\\' access to asylum procedures and education?\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert said that in recent years, there had been a rise in hate speech across the world, including in Greece. What measures were in place to tackle racist hate speech targeting migrants and minorities, and xenophobia?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the State was proud of improvements that had been made in the situation on the State\\'s islands. The Hellenic Coast Guard\\'s practices followed international law. All allegations of pushbacks were appropriately investigated by monitoring bodies. From 2015 to the present, the Coast Guard had rescued over 250,000 persons at sea. From 2013, Coast Guard officers had been trained in basic human rights principles.\\n\\nGreece was stepping up efforts to prevent trafficking in persons through legal and policy instruments. The national action plan on trafficking in persons was being updated to address financial and labour exploitation. The State party had organised seminars and created standards on the financial aspects of these crimes. New forms of exploitation had been added to legislation. Accommodation, medical care and legal counselling were provided to victims of trafficking in persons. A leaflet on human trafficking had been produced in several languages.\\n\\nThe State party was prioritising the ratification of International Labour Organization convention 29 on forced labour. This process was expected to be completed soon. A plan for the prevention of labour exploitation was formulated by the State each year and preventative inspections were carried out twice a year in vulnerable sectors. Employees could file complaints through an online anonymous complaints service, by email or a telephone hotline. The State provided migrant workers with information about their rights.\\n\\nA programme was in place to increase access to medical staff in asylum centres through measures such as the temporary transfer of medical personnel. Around 16,200 refugee students from 70 different countries were enrolled in Greek educational institutions. Case managers trained in the best interests of the child monitored age assessment procedures, which would soon be harmonised across all European Union Member States.\\n\\nGreece had ratified the regional conventions on safety in sport matches and had implemented legislation that prohibited banners at sporting matches with racist or sexist content.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said Greece only formally recognised one minority, Thrace Muslims. Why were other minority groups not recognised as minorities? What data was collected on minorities? How well represented was the Muslim minority in public bodies and in elected roles at national and local levels?\\n\\nWhat outcomes had been achieved by the last national strategy on the inclusion of the Roma and what progress had been made in implementing the current strategy? Were the Roma consulted about policies and strategies that affected them? Roma people reportedly continued to be victims of discrimination in Greece when trying to access healthcare, housing and employment. Many Roma people lived below the poverty threshold and struggled to access basic services. What measures were in place to ensure equal access for Roma children to education and schooling? What measures were in place to improve access to paid employment and quality healthcare for the Roma? Roma often lacked access to heating, running water and toilets. How was the State party preventing forced evictions and fines for illegal construction? Roma people faced long, costly judicial procedures to acquire Greek nationality. How was the State party promoting their access to nationality?\\n\\nThe Committee noted the adoption of several laws and the national strategy in favour of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. However, this community continued to be subjected to discrimination in schools and public services. What measures were in place to tackle such discrimination? What results had the national strategy achieved?\\n\\nThere were reports of migrant women, including pregnant women, having been assaulted by Greek Coast Guards. Greece had the highest rate of femicide in Europe. What measures were in place to address violence against women?\\n\\nWhat statistics did the State party have on people of African descent and their integration in public life? What activities had been undertaken as part of the International Decade for People of African Descent? How was the State party combatting the multiple forms of discrimination faced by this group? What measures were in place to implement the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action? Was there a formal mechanism in place to assess its implementation?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the term \"minority\" in Greece was understood under stricter criteria than those of the Committee. The State party respected the principle of self-identification. Groups of people who were not recognised as a minority enjoyed all rights under the Convention. Four members of the Hellenic Parliament were Muslims, and more than 100 Muslims had been elected to public bodies.\\n\\nThe Roma had expressed the will not to be considered as an ethnic minority. Authorities paid particular attention to this vulnerable group. The State had made the civil registry process easier and more efficient for the Roma. The previous strategy on Roma inclusion provided specific interventions to address early school dropouts and support access to health and housing. Implementation of this strategy was independently reviewed. There were also 85 local action plans on Roma support elaborated with the Roma population. There was an open, independent consultation platform with 13 Roma organizations that met every three months to devise strategies for Roma inclusion.\\n\\nRoma people were eligible for all State welfare benefits. The State party was promoting the Roma\\'s participation in education and the labour market. The public employment service implemented targeted programmes for the Roma, such as 15,000-euro subsidies for Roma who started a business and training and certification in technical jobs.\\n\\nThe Government had taken measures to facilitate the inclusion of Roma children in education. Psychosocial support was provided to vulnerable students in schools. Roma children could be enrolled in schools without official documentation. Teacher training programmes were provided on combatting early school dropouts and supporting Roma children.\\n\\nThe State party did not have records of complaints against Coast Guard officials regarding sexual assault of pregnant women. This year, there had been 12 victims of femicide. The State party had ratified the Istanbul Convention and was collecting data on violence against women and conducting training in schools to raise awareness of the issue. There was a large network of structures for supporting women victims, who had access to emergency accommodation.\\n\\nThe national strategy on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons aimed to combat discrimination and promote equality for these people. All ministries carried out actions supporting these people.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said there were gaps between policies for the Roma and practices. What was the size of the Roma population? What were the causes of femicides in the State party and the ethnic origins of the victims? Had the State party considered making a law on femicide?\\n\\nA Committee Expert said Roma children were being segregated in Greek schools. How many Roma children were participating in and graduating from inclusive public education?\\n\\nFAITH DIKELEDI PANSY TLAKULA, Committee Expert and Follow-Up Rapporteur, said the Committee had previously expressed concern about the poor working conditions of migrant workers in the agricultural sector and the informal economy. What investigations had been carried out into the exploitation of migrant workers and what compensation was provided to victims? Were employers who imposed abusive labour conditions subjected to criminal sanctions? What training was provided to labour inspectors on identifying victims of human trafficking?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said Greece\\'s efforts to preserve its historical monuments were commendable.\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece was home to a vibrant community of people of African descent, many of whom held leading roles in civil society and public organizations. Greece fully supported the pending General Assembly resolution to declare a second International Decade for People of African DescentOpens in new window. The National Council against Racism and Intolerance was implementing measures to support the rights of people of African descent.\\n\\nThere were 120,000 Roma people in Greece, 20,000 of whom received guaranteed minimum income support. To encourage school attendance, families whose children did not attend school did not receive welfare benefits. Investments had been made to improve housing infrastructure in Roma communities.\\n\\nAround 1,600 labour inspections were carried out this year and fines were issued in around 700 cases. Twenty cases had been reported to the Public Prosecutor regarding potential victims of trafficking in persons. Standards had been developed for seasonal housing for migrant workers. The labour inspectorate\\'s staff had been increased recently. All inspectors participated in training on preventing and identifying human trafficking.\\n\\nClosing Remarks\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, thanked the delegation for the dialogue, which had been intensive, fruitful, frank and necessary. The questions raised by the Committee aimed to assess progress in the implementation of the Convention to help the Committee to develop recommendations that were helpful to Greece.\\n\\nIOANNIS GHIKAS, Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said the dialogue had been intense but constructive, identifying issues that the State party needed to address. Greece was proud of the Greek Committee Expert Stamatia Stavrinaki, who was an excellent representative of the tradition of human rights scholarship in Greece. The strong representation of women in the delegation was a representation of the reality in Greece, where promoting women\\'s representation was a high priority. The State was proud of the progress it had made since the last review, including in protecting the rights of asylum seekers and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons.'}, {'topic': 'Race Bilingual', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech and racial issues in bilingual communities', 'title': 'How all schools teach about race and the Latinx experience, according to new book', 'url': 'https://www.calonews.com/featured-topics/culture/how-all-schools-teach-about-race-and-the-latinx-experience-according-to-new-book/article_a1b7cede-b282-11ef-ad2d-2365839fe2ff.html', 'published_date': '2024-12-06T16:21:30Z', 'source': 'CaloNews.com', 'content': 'A conversation with Lauren Chavez-Moreno, author of \"How Schools Make Race: Teaching Latinx Racialization in America.\"\\n\\nAs a former Spanish teacher, Lauren Chavez-Moreno often witnessed her students grappling with racial identity and cultural expectations in ways she wasn\\'t fully prepared to address. Her students\\' comments and questions opened her eyes to the complexities of racialization within the school system. She recalls the challenges of navigating these moments, feeling the weight of her responsibility as an educator to address these issues thoughtfully.\\n\\nChavez-Moreno\\'s new book, \"How Schools Make Race: Teaching Latinx Racialization in America,\" draws from these formative experiences, blending them with years of academic research to unpack how schools subtly shape racial identities, especially for Latinx students.\\n\\nThe book addresses sensitive issues, like the limitations placed on teachers in discussing race openly, the diversity (or lack thereof) within bilingual teaching staff, and the challenges faced by Latinx students in predominantly white school systems.\\n\\nChavez-Moreno\\'s decision to avoid naming specific schools or states in her research highlights the universal nature of racialization in education. As she points out, the underlying process of racial identity formation is a nationwide phenomenon, not confined to any particular region. This broad perspective underscores the pervasiveness of racialization in shaping students\\' identities, an issue Chavez-Moreno believes requires urgent attention from educators, administrators, and policymakers alike.\\n\\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nThis book essentially covers the time when Donald Trump was elected president in 2016 and fast forward to now. The book is out and we live in a reality where Trump will be president again. So I simply want to ask you, what does the re-election of Donald Trump mean for this type of research and future work?\\n\\nI\\'m not really sure how I could answer that because it\\'s still... I was walking yesterday, and I was trying to process, thinking, \"I can\\'t believe this is happening again and worse.\" It\\'s not going to be the same. It\\'s going to be worse. I really don\\'t know how to answer that, besides the fact that, like you mentioned, I was in classrooms in a Midwest swing state [in 2016] and heard things like students saying, \"Miss, I\\'m not coming tomorrow; I\\'m going to be deported.\" It\\'s interesting because last week, I was in Arizona doing a research study, and exactly the same phrase was used. So, it\\'s deeply saddening, and I haven\\'t fully processed it.\\n\\nCould I add, though, being in the classrooms in Arizona versus being in the classrooms in the previous study in the Midwestern state, I feel like, can I go back to the other classrooms? Because in Arizona, teachers were basically forbidden. One of the teachers told me we were muzzled to talk to our students about the election. So there was a lot of fear, and that fear wasn\\'t addressed, so there was this stifling silence in the schools.\\n\\nWhen I began reading the book, I thought this was going to be a message to teachers and their pedagogy and what things should and shouldn\\'t be done in the classroom. But I found that your book isn\\'t just about teacher pedagogy but rather how institutions shape these racial identities and social structures.\\n\\nThanks for noticing that the book isn\\'t trying to dictate what teachers should or shouldn\\'t do. It is about showing how, often in hidden ways, schooling institutions create these ideas about racial categories. But to clarify, I\\'m less focused on individual identity formation and more on the formation of groups. That\\'s a key distinction.\\n\\nIn the book, you spend a significant portion defining terms like race, ethnicity and racialization. Why was it necessary to invest so much time in clarification?\\n\\nThat\\'s kind of the business of academia. As scholars, we need to explain what we mean by terms instead of assuming shared understanding. For example, if I use the term \"Latinx\" without explanation, readers might misinterpret its meaning. Being explicit about concepts helps guide understanding, especially when dealing with theory. It\\'s interesting that you notice that because that\\'s actually something that I also advocate in my other work, for scholars to be clear about how they conceptualize specific terms and concepts.\\n\\n\"I was in classrooms in a Midwest swing state [in 2016] and heard things like students saying, \"Miss, I\\'m not coming tomorrow; I\\'m going to be deported.\" It\\'s interesting because last week, I was in Arizona doing a research study, and exactly the same phrase was used.\"\\n\\nIn the book, you mentioned using \"Latinx\" for political reasons.\\n\\nSo, I first heard Latinx when I was a doctoral student, and I liked it because I saw it as a gift from the queer and trans communities to challenge the gender binary and patriarchy. As time went on, I started hearing people use \"Latine,\" but the reasons I heard for using \"Latine\" weren\\'t very appealing to me. As I kept reading other authors and their interpretations of the \"X\" in Latinx, I came across Claudia Milian\\'s book \"LatinX.\" In that book, she mentions that one of the meanings of the \"X\" could be crossing out \"Latin,\" a word rooted in colonialism and Europe. I loved that idea.\\n\\nThis distinction is crucial because racialization is highly context-specific. For example, in Guatemala, there is a racialized group called Ladino (not Latino). If someone who identifies as Ladino in Guatemala moves to the U.S., that label doesn\\'t translate or hold the same meaning here. Similarly, someone from Latin America identifying as \"Latino\" might find that the U.S. context racializes the term differently, and it doesn\\'t carry the same understanding.\\n\\nSo, when I use \"Latinx,\" it signals to my readers that I\\'m talking about a racialized group within the specific context of the U.S., not about Latin Americans as a whole. That\\'s why the \"X\" is meaningful -- it serves as a marker of this distinction.\\n\\nDoes your use of \"Latinx\" come up in your teaching?\\n\\nOh, definitely. I\\'ve noticed a trend among my students where they often use \"Latine,\" and they\\'re curious about why I use \"Latinx.\" I explain my reasons to them, but I make it clear: I\\'m not trying to convince or convert them to use \"Latinx.\" I tell them, \"This is why I use it, but it\\'s totally fine if you choose to use something else in your work.\" It\\'s something I bring up to share my perspective, but I emphasize that they\\'re free to have their own reasons and use whichever term they prefer.\\n\\nYou obviously speak to educators and students but something I found particularly interesting is that you also address parents. I see this text as not only essential for educators but also potentially valuable for parents. What should parents know about how schools shape racial identities?\\n\\nI did interview parents for the study, and I noticed that parents had different ideas about what should be taught in schools -- which, of course, isn\\'t surprising. But for teachers to engage in this kind of work, there needs to be community support and parents are a key part of that community. It\\'s crucial to remember their role in supporting teachers as they undertake this work. By \"this type of work,\" I mean helping students develop critical racial consciousness and addressing questions about race explicitly. Schools, as I argue in the book, already teach about race in implicit ways. However, we must also engage with race explicitly, advancing anti-racist thinking and critically examining race as a construct. Parents\\' support is essential in fostering this kind of education.\\n\\nHow can parents advocate for a more equitable and inclusive education for their children?\\n\\nOne of the things I noticed in my study was a meeting, maybe \"Town Hall\" is too formal a term, between parents, students, and teachers of the bilingual program. They met on a Saturday morning to discuss the program\\'s history, importance and challenges, as well as to hear from both students and parents. What struck me most was that parents were very adamant about teachers needing to be 100% bilingual and highly proficient in Spanish. Their focus was entirely on language proficiency. I also heard similar sentiments from students I interviewed, some of whom chose not to participate in the program. For example, one student said, \"I don\\'t want to be in the program because my teacher pollutes my Spanish.\"\\n\\nI mention this example because, during that meeting, no parent brought up the importance of teachers developing students\\' critical consciousness. The focus was solely on language -- ensuring students learned English and spoke perfect Spanish. I think this emphasis stems from a stigma about students being viewed as \"pocho\" or not having perfect Spanish.\\n\\nTo answer your question about how parents can advocate, they should show up at these meetings and expand the conversation. Of course, they can express the importance of bilingualism, but they should also emphasize the need for teachers to develop student awareness of societal injustices and their critical consciousness. That would be a significant step forward.\\n\\nI was also intrigued by the makeup of the teachers you chose, or who were selected, and the very interesting group of people that emerged. One seemed almost overtly racist, and it was fascinating to see how race shaped their perspective. The gender makeup of the educators was also notable.\\n\\nOne of the things I found interesting was the very small number of Latino, Latina or Latinx teachers in the program. The program had 15 teachers across two schools that I observed. Not all of them participated in the study, but I believe it was around 12 or 13 who did. However, the majority of the teachers were white or self-identified as white, which stood out to me. It was notable that, in a bilingual program in a Midwestern state, the teaching staff was still predominantly white. I say \"still\" because this pattern was consistent with what I observed outside the program as well.\\n\\nAnother interesting point was who was leading lessons that challenged racism and addressed social justice. As I mentioned, there were very few Latinx teachers in my study, so I didn\\'t have many opportunities to observe whether they would approach these topics differently. There was also an immigrant teacher from Spain who incorporated some of these ideas in their classroom.\\n\\nThis study wasn\\'t designed to assess whether white teachers are more critically conscious than Latinx teachers. What I did notice, in terms of patterns, was that the teachers leading critical lessons were mostly white. That\\'s why I don\\'t find that particular observation especially compelling.\\n\\nWhy did you avoid naming specific schools or states in the book?\\n\\nThere are very few bilingual programs at the secondary level, especially in middle and high schools. That\\'s why I didn\\'t name the state but it\\'s also something I realized after the fact. I also appreciate that choice because I wasn\\'t just focusing on one specific place; I\\'m talking about something that happens in schools everywhere. All schools in the U.S., in my opinion, contribute to shaping ideas about race. Because schools are central in our racialized society, they maintain and sometimes challenge ideas about race. They can reinforce these ideas or offer new perspectives, but they shape how we think about racial groups. So, while I don\\'t specify the state, school or city, I wanted to provide an example that helps us think about how this process works more broadly. It may not look exactly the same in every place, but if we think about how schools make race, it\\'s helpful to recognize that this isn\\'t just something that happens in one city. It could be anywhere in the U.S.\\n\\nWould that at all be influenced by the fact that, to me, it\\'s interesting you say this can happen anywhere in the U.S., regardless of the specific makeup of a city or state? The immediate question that comes to mind is that not all cities and states are the same, and not all educators have the same demographic makeup. So, I\\'m kind of challenging that idea: what does it say about the institutions pushing for a more diverse group of educators and students? When you say this can happen anywhere, does that mean the work being done to increase diversity has a broader significance?\\n\\nWhat I mean by saying this can happen anywhere is not that the specifics are the same, but that the process of racialization happens everywhere. The making of race and the teaching of race occur everywhere. It\\'s not about the particulars; it\\'s about the broader process. I assume we live in a racialized society, so even if this were Alaska, Hawaii or Florida, the U.S. has undergone a process of racializing its groups. The specifics could vary, different states might have different laws or approaches, but schools are teaching about race, whether implicitly or explicitly. The lessons may differ, but they\\'re still about race.\\n\\nFor example, a school that offers ethnic studies and takes an anti-colonial, anti-imperialist stance is still teaching about race, even if the content and perspective differ. So, when I say this process happens everywhere, I\\'m talking about the underlying similarity, not the exact details.\\n\\n\"...in Arizona, teachers were basically forbidden. One of the teachers told me we were muzzled to talk to our students about the election. So there was a lot of fear, and that fear wasn\\'t addressed, so there was this stifling silence in the schools.\"\\n\\nI noticed that your educational background highlighted the importance of culturally relevant, race-conscious teaching. Why did your educational journey become so important to you that you wrote about it?\\n\\nMy background as an educator is shaped by political events in the U.S. For example, the banning of bilingual education in California and Arizona had a significant impact on me during my time as both a high school and undergraduate student. I had always planned to become a teacher, but at that point, I wasn\\'t sure whether I wanted to teach history or Spanish. When bilingual education was banned in Arizona, it really solidified my decision to become a Spanish teacher. I saw the ban as an attack on immigrants and the Latinx community, and that made it clear to me which path I wanted to pursue.\\n\\nI saw language as a very important issue for the community, which is why I chose to teach Spanish. Even from that point, it was something that mattered deeply to me. But being a teacher also had a major influence on how I think about the book. When I was teaching, my students talked about race all the time, through jokes and casual comments, it was something that came up constantly. However, as a teacher, I didn\\'t always know how to address it in a productive or helpful way. Sometimes, I felt like I was teaching concepts but not scaffolding my students\\' thinking effectively. I\\'d either move too slowly or too quickly, and I wasn\\'t prepared to teach about these complex issues. As many people know, these are very sensitive and taboo topics, and you can get into a lot of trouble if you don\\'t handle them correctly. It takes a lot of bravery as a teacher, and sometimes I made big mistakes. But these experiences were also formative for me and helped shape how I think about these issues.\\n\\nI want to focus on the recommendations you make in the conclusion of your book, particularly when you discuss embracing theory. I found it insightful when you mention that individual teachers don\\'t have all the answers. This really resonated with me because it highlights the vulnerability of educators and how that can be an asset.\\n\\nOne teacher I really admired shared that she knew she didn\\'t have all the answers, but she wanted to explore the issues with her students, and I truly admired that. It takes a lot of courage, and she was a very brave educator. Many of her lessons were meaningful to her students. I believe teachers can support each other by collaborating and sharing ideas for these kinds of lessons. I\\'m a strong advocate for taking an inquiry stance in teaching, which helps educators improve their own practices. I learned this approach from Professor Marilyn Cochran-Smith and her work with Susan Lytle. It involves teachers being systematic and intentional about examining their teaching in collaboration with others, looking at student work, discussing how to challenge students and exploring ways to expand their thinking.\\n\\nThe best teacher preparation, in my opinion, focuses on helping teachers feel supported and confident enough to take risks in the classroom. Vulnerability in teaching often means taking risks, so to foster this, teachers need ample support and proper training.\\n\\nYou can buy a copy of \"How Schools Make Race: Teaching Latinx Racialization in America\" here.'}, {'topic': 'Race Bilingual', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech and racial issues in bilingual communities', 'title': 'The Systemic Abyss', 'url': 'https://djhzeijoyesu.medium.com/the-systemic-abyss-c339ff2b7d74', 'published_date': '2024-12-06T22:02:51Z', 'source': 'Medium', 'content': 'This paper examines the profound historical, psychological, and social implications of the racial slur \"nigger,\" advocating for its abolition as a symbol of systemic oppression and moral degradation. By contrasting the prohibition of prayer in secular systems with the tolerance of this slur, the paper critiques the inadequacies of current structural frameworks in addressing systemic injustice. It further explores how language shapes societal norms and proposes a framework for rethinking linguistic accountability, with a focus on scientific and sociological research. The paper concludes by recommending legislative, cultural, and educational strategies to eradicate this term, emphasizing its potential to serve as a precedent for combating other forms of hate speech.\\n\\nLanguage is a powerful tool for constructing reality. Words have the ability to heal, inspire, harm, or dehumanize. Few words encapsulate this duality as starkly as the racial slur \"nigger.\" Originating in colonial times as a means of dehumanizing African-descended individuals, this word persists as a vestige of slavery and systemic racism. While the global community recognizes hate speech as a moral and legal offense, this particular term remains paradoxically present in cultural and societal contexts. This paper explores why its abolition is necessary, examining systemic contradictions such as the prohibition of prayer in secular institutions, which reflects inconsistent applications of societal norms.\\n\\nThe word \"nigger\" is not merely a slur; it is a linguistic artifact of oppression. Its use was instrumental in the transatlantic slave trade, serving to justify inhuman treatment and the commodification of Black individuals. Even post-slavery, its usage perpetuated psychological trauma and reinforced systemic segregation. This section will:\\n\\nDiscuss its transition into contemporary usage, including its appropriation in some cultural contexts.\\n\\n2.1 Psychological and Sociological Impacts\\n\\nNumerous studies document the detrimental effects of slurs on mental health, self-perception, and societal cohesion. This section will review research on how such language perpetuates stereotypes, normalizes violence, and undermines equality.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3. The Structural Contradictions of Language and Law\\n\\n3.1 Prohibition of Prayer vs. Tolerance of Slurs\\n\\nModern secular systems often prohibit religious expression, such as prayer, in public spaces to maintain neutrality. However, the tolerance or legal protection of hate speech like \"nigger\" reveals a profound inconsistency. This section will:\\n\\nAnalyze legal frameworks governing free speech and hate speech.\\n\\nContrast the treatment of spiritual expressions and harmful language.\\n\\nExamine the ethical implications of these inconsistencies.\\n\\n3.2 Systemic Inadequacies\\n\\nThe persistence of this slur highlights structural failures in addressing racism. These include:\\n\\nEducational deficits in teaching about historical racism.\\n\\n4.1 Linguistic Accountability and Societal Health\\n\\nLanguage shapes cultural norms and individual behaviors. Allowing derogatory terms like \"nigger\" to persist undermines societal progress. Abolition serves not only as a symbolic act but as a practical step toward dismantling systemic racism.\\n\\n4.2 International Precedents\\n\\nCountries like Germany have outlawed Nazi symbols and hate speech to prevent the perpetuation of oppressive ideologies. This section will analyze these precedents and their applicability to abolishing the word \"nigger.\"\\n\\n4.3 Practical Strategies for Abolition\\n\\nLegislation: Enacting laws to classify the word as hate speech subject to penalties.\\n\\nCultural Transformation: Promoting alternative narratives and redefining societal values through media and art.\\n\\nEducation: Developing curricula that address the history and harm of this word.\\n\\nPrayer, often prohibited in secular systems, represents spiritual and personal empowerment. Its suppression contrasts sharply with the permissibility of language that dehumanizes. This section examines:\\n\\nThe role of prayer in fostering social cohesion and personal resilience.\\n\\nThe systemic bias in prioritizing secular neutrality over human dignity.\\n\\nHow addressing such contradictions can strengthen structural justice.\\n\\nThis paper proposes a unified framework to address linguistic and structural inequities:\\n\\nRestorative Justice: Encouraging reparative dialogue and reconciliation.\\n\\nLegislative Reform: Balancing free speech with protections against harm.\\n\\nGlobal Solidarity: Collaborating across cultures to combat hate speech.\\n\\nThe abolition of the word \"nigger\" represents a critical step in addressing systemic racism and linguistic harm. By treating its usage as a form of societal profligation subject to severe penalties, we signal a commitment to justice and equity. Contrasting this with the prohibition of prayer reveals deep systemic contradictions, underscoring the need for comprehensive reform. A future free of such dehumanizing language is possible through legislative action, cultural transformation, and education.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe word \"nigger\" holds a unique and deeply traumatic position in the history of racial oppression, symbolizing systemic racism and violence. Despite occasional reappropriation within Black communities, its continued use outside these contexts perpetuates harm, discrimination, and psychological trauma. This paper contrasts the societal prohibition of \"prayer\" in certain public or governmental spaces with the tolerated use of racial slurs, highlighting structural inconsistencies. By drawing from historical, psychological, and legal perspectives, this study advocates for the abolition of such language through strict societal and legal frameworks.\\n\\nHistorical Context and Systemic Impacts\\n\\nThe n-word\\'s origin as a tool of dehumanization dates back to slavery and segregation, where it was a prelude to violence, including lynching and other atrocities. Its persistence symbolizes a system that normalizes anti-Blackness and undermines societal equity. Scholars have identified the word as \"the atomic bomb of racial slurs,\" reflecting its uniquely destructive psychological and societal impact. The term reinforces systemic racism by perpetuating stereotypes and fostering environments where discrimination thrives (sources: ADL, Psychology Today).\\n\\nLegal and Psychological Perspectives\\n\\nThe legal system inconsistently addresses hate speech and racial slurs. While hate crimes laws penalize acts motivated by bias, proving intent remains challenging. The n-word often functions as a trigger for violence, demonstrating its potent psychological effects. Studies show that exposure to racial slurs can cause enduring trauma, influencing behaviors and mental health over time (sources: OHCHR, OJP, Psychology Today).\\n\\nStructural Inadequacies: Prayer vs. Hate Speech\\n\\nContrasting the restriction of prayer in public institutions with the leniency towards racial slurs highlights systemic contradictions. Prayer is often prohibited in contexts aiming to uphold neutrality and prevent marginalization. However, the tolerance of racial epithets undermines this neutrality by tacitly endorsing harm against marginalized groups. This inconsistency reveals a structural failure to equitably protect individual dignity and safety.\\n\\nRecommendations\\n\\n1. Abolition Through Legislation: Strengthen hate speech laws to explicitly include the prohibition of racial slurs, with penalties reflecting their societal harm.\\n\\n2. Education and Awareness: Implement educational initiatives to address the history and impact of such language, emphasizing its role in systemic oppression.\\n\\n3. Community Empowerment: Support the reappropriation of language within marginalized communities while discouraging its use by others to prevent perpetuation of harm.\\n\\n4. Structural Reforms: Address systemic biases in policy-making that tolerate harmful language while restricting other forms of expression.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe systemic tolerance of racial slurs like the n-word is a manifestation of structural racism that undermines societal progress. Abolishing such language requires a comprehensive approach involving legal, educational, and social reforms. Addressing this issue not only honors the dignity of those affected but also strengthens the moral and ethical fabric of society.\\n\\nIn the sprawling labyrinth of systemic governance, where laws claim to safeguard dignity and equality, a glaring hypocrisy festers. On one hand, institutions silence prayer -- a quiet invocation of hope, unity, and introspection -- under the guise of secular neutrality. On the other, these same systems shield hate speech, particularly the visceral linguistic weaponry of the word \"nigger,\" cloaking its use in the sanctity of \"free expression.\" This contradiction is not a mere oversight but a seismic failure of moral and structural integrity. The persistence of this slur serves as an indictment of the inadequacies of modern systems, exposing their complicity in perpetuating oppression while masquerading as bastions of liberty.\\n\\n1. Prayer: Silenced Benevolence\\n\\nPrayer, an act of spiritual alignment and communal solace, is systematically expunged from public spaces to uphold secularism. This prohibition is framed as essential to protecting inclusivity, yet it suppresses a harmless, often uplifting practice. The rationale behind this exclusion betrays a fear of offense, yet paradoxically, it allows offensive language -- rooted in hate -- to flourish unchecked.\\n\\n2. The N-Word: Protected Oppression\\n\\nThe n-word, a verbal relic of slavery\\'s barbarity, survives as a cultural anomaly: a word so potent in its dehumanization that it continues to wound across generations. Protected by laws intended to defend expression, it has become a totem of systemic hypocrisy. By tolerating its usage, societies tacitly endorse its underlying ideology -- one that denies humanity and perpetuates racial hierarchies.\\n\\nSanctifying Harm, Criminalizing Hope\\n\\nThe double standard between prayer and slurs unmasks a systemic prioritization of abstract ideals over tangible harm. Prayer, which often fosters connection and resilience, is suppressed as potentially divisive, while slurs, which undeniably fracture the social fabric, are tolerated. This prioritization reveals a skewed moral compass, where the avoidance of ideological discomfort supersedes the protection of human dignity.\\n\\nLegal Contradictions as a Disgrace\\n\\nSecular laws punish expressions of spirituality to preserve neutrality, yet they fail to curtail language explicitly designed to oppress. This contradiction underscores the inadequacy of frameworks that claim to champion equality while upholding structural inequities.\\n\\n1. Legislative Abolition of Hate Speech\\n\\nSocieties must confront their linguistic relics with unflinching clarity. Laws should eradicate racial slurs from public lexicons, treating them as instruments of psychological violence. This abolition would signal a decisive rejection of systemic racism.\\n\\n2. Cultural Renaissance\\n\\nA cultural movement is needed to reclaim linguistic spaces from the shadows of oppression. Through art, education, and public discourse, society must dismantle the normalized violence of slurs while redefining speech as a tool for justice, not harm.\\n\\n3. Reframing Freedom\\n\\nTrue freedom lies not in the unchecked license to harm but in the empowerment of individuals to coexist with dignity. Reframing freedom as responsibility would enable societies to prioritize collective well-being over the preservation of outdated and oppressive norms.\\n\\nThe systemic tolerance of the n-word, juxtaposed with the prohibition of prayer, symbolizes a deep moral chasm. This inconsistency is not just a structural flaw but a betrayal of justice itself. To reclaim societal integrity, we must uproot these double standards and construct frameworks that honor the intrinsic worth of every individual. The abolition of hateful language is not an attack on freedom but its ultimate affirmation -- a visionary step toward a future where words heal rather than harm.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

She is the author of \"Priests of Our Democracy: The Supreme Court, Academic Freedom, and the Anti-Communist Purge,\" which won the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award in Book Publishing in 2013, and \"Not in Front of the Children: Indecency, Censorship, and the Innocence of Youth,\" which won the American Library Association\\'s Eli Oboler Award for Best Published Work in the Field of Intellectual Freedom in 2002.\\n\\nHer most recent book is \"Ironies and Complications of Free Speech: News and Commentary From the Free Expression Policy Project.\" She has written three other books and scores of popular and scholarly articles on free speech, censorship, constitutional law, copyright, and the arts. She has taught at New York University, the University of California - San Diego, Boston College Law School, and the American University of Paris. Since 2015, she has been a volunteer tour guide at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\\n\\nGreene: Can you introduce yourself and the work you\\'ve done on free speech and how you got there?\\n\\nHeins: I\\'m Marjorie Heins, I\\'m a retired lawyer. I spent most of my career at the ACLU. I started in Boston, where we had a very small office, and we sort of did everything -- some sex discrimination cases, a lot of police misconduct cases, occasionally First Amendment. Then, after doing some teaching and a stint at the Massachusetts Attorney General\\'s office, I found myself in the national office of the ACLU in New York, starting a project on art censorship. This was in response to the political brouhaha over the National Endowment for the Arts starting around 1989/ 1990.\\n\\nCulture wars, attacks on some of the grants made by the NEA, became a big hot button issue. The ACLU was able to raise a little foundation money to hire a lawyer to work on some of these cases. And one case that was already filed when I got there was National Endowment for the Arts vs Finley. It was basically a challenge by four theater performance artists whose grants had been recommended by the peer panel but then ultimately vetoed by the director after a lot of political pressure because their work was very much \"on the edge.\" So I joined the legal team in that case, the Finley case, and it had a long and complicated history. Then, by the mid-1990s we were faced with the internet. And there were all these scares over pornography on the internet poisoning the minds of our children. So the ACLU got very involved in challenging censorship legislation that had been passed by Congress, and I worked on those cases.\\n\\nI left the ACLU in 1998 to write a book about what I had learned about censorship. I was curious to find out more about the history primarily of obscenity legislation -- the censorship of sexual communications. So it\\'s a scholarly book called \"Not in front of the Children.\" Among the things I discovered is that the origins of censorship of sexual content, sexual communications, come out of this notion that we need to protect children and other \"vulnerable beings.\" And initially that included women and uneducated people, but eventually it really boiled down to children -- we need censorship basically of everybody in order to protect children. So that\\'s what Not in front of the Children was all about.\\n\\nAnd then I took my foundation contacts -- because at the ACLU if you have a project you have to raise money -- and started a little project, a little think tank which became affiliated with the National Coalition Against Censorship called the Free Expression Policy Project. And at that point we weren\\'t really doing litigation anymore, we were doing a lot of friend of the court briefs, a lot of policy reports and advocacy articles about some of the values and competing interests in the whole area of free expression. And one premise of this project, from the start, was that we are not absolutists. So we didn\\'t accept the notion that because the First Amendment says \"Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech,\" then there\\'s some kind of absolute protection for something called free speech and there can\\'t be any exceptions. And, of course, there are many exceptions.\\n\\nSo the basic premise of the Free Expression Policy Project was that some exceptions to the First Amendment, like obscenity laws, are not really justified because they are driven by different ideas about morality and a notion of moral or emotional harm rather than some tangible harm that you can identify like, for example, in the area of libel and slander or invasion of privacy or harassment. Yes, there are exceptions. The default, the presumption, is free speech, but there could be many reasons why free speech is curtailed in certain circumstances.\\n\\nThe Free Expression Policy Project continued for about seven years. It moved to the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law School for a while, and, finally, I ran out of ideas and funding. I kept up the website for a little while longer, then ultimately ended the website. Then I thought, \"okay, there\\'s a lot of good information on this website and it\\'s all going to disappear, so I\\'m going to put it into a book.\" Oh, I left out the other book I worked on in the early 2000s - about academic freedom, the history of academic freedom, called \"Priests of Our Democracy: The Supreme Court, Academic Freedom, and the Anti-Communist Purge.\" This book goes back in history even before the 1940s and 1950s Red Scare and the effect that it had on teachers and universities. And then this last book is called \"Ironies and Complications of Free Speech: News and Commentary From the Free Expression Policy Project,\" which is basically an anthology of the best writings from the Free Expression Policy Project.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s me. That\\'s what I did.\\n\\nGreene: So we have a ton to talk about because a lot of the things you\\'ve written about are either back in the news and regulatory cycle or never left it. So I want to start with your book \"Not in Front of the Children\" first. I have at least one copy and I\\'ve been referring to it a lot and suggesting it because we\\'ve just seen a ton of efforts to try and pass new child protection laws to protect kids from online harms. And so I\\'m curious, first there was a raft of efforts around Tik Tok being bad for kids, now we\\'re seeing a lot of efforts aimed at shielding kids from harmful material online. Do you think this a throughline from concerns back from mid-19th Century England. Is it still the same debate or is there something different about these online harms?\\n\\nBoth are true I think. It\\'s the same and it\\'s different. What\\'s the same is that using the children as an argument for basically trying to suppress information, ideas, or expression that somebody disapproves of goes back to the beginning of censorship laws around sexuality. And the subject matters have changed, the targets have changed. I\\'m not too aware of new proposals for internet censorship of kids, but I\\'m certainly aware of what states -- of course, Florida being the most prominent example -- have done in terms of school books, school library books, public library books, and education from not only k-12 but also higher education in terms of limiting the subject matters that can be discussed. And the primary target seems to be anything to do with gay or lesbian sexuality and anything having to do with a frank acknowledgement of American slavery or Jim Crow racism. Because the argument in Florida, and this is explicit in the law, is because it would make white kids feel bad, so let\\'s not talk about it. So in that sense the two targets that I see now -- we\\'ve got to protect the kids against information about gay and lesbian people and information about the true racial history of this country -- are a little different from the 19th century and even much of the 20th century.\\n\\nGreene: One of the things I see is that the harms motivating the book bans and school restrictions are the same harms that are motivating at least some of the legislators who are trying to pass these laws. And notably a lot of the laws only address online harmful material without being specific about subject matter. We\\'re still seeing some that are specifically about sexual material, but a lot of them, including the Kids Online Safety Act really just focus on online harms more broadly.\\n\\nI haven\\'t followed that one, but it sounds like it might have a vagueness problem!\\n\\nGreene: One of the things I get concerned about with the focus on design is that, like, a state Attorney General is not going to be upset if the design has kids reading a lot of bible verses or tomes about being respectful to your parents. But they will get upset and prosecute people if the design feature is recommending to kids gender-affirming care or whatever. I just don\\'t know if there\\'s a way of protecting against that in a law.\\n\\nWell, as we all know, when we\\'re dealing with commercial speech there\\'s a lot more leeway in terms of regulation, and especially if ads are directed at kids. So I don\\'t have a problem with government legislation in the area of restricting the kinds of advertising that can be directed at kids. But if you get out of the area of commercial speech and to something that\\'s kind of medical, could you have constitutional legislation that prohibited websites from directing kids to medically dangerous procedures? You\\'re sort of getting close to the borderline. If it\\'s just information then I think the legislation is probably going to be unconstitutional even if it\\'s related to kids.\\n\\nGreene: Let\\'s shift to academic freedom. Which is another fraught issue. What do you think of the current debates now over both restrictions on faculty and universities restricting student speech?\\n\\nAcademic freedom is under the gun from both sides of the political spectrum. For example, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, although they seem well-intentioned, have led to some pretty troubling outcomes. So that when those college presidents were being interrogated by the members of Congress (in December 2023), they were in a difficult position, among other reasons, because at least at Harvard and Penn it was pretty clear there were instances of really appalling applications of this idea of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion - both to require a certain kind of ideological approach and to censor or punish people who didn\\'t go along with the party line, so to speak.\\n\\nThe other example I\\'m thinking of, and I don\\'t know if Harvard and Penn do this - I know that the University of California system does it or at least it used to - everybody who applies for a faculty position has to sign a diversity statement, like a loyalty oath, saying that these are the principles they agree with and they will promise to promote.\\n\\nAnd you know you have examples, I mean I may sound very retrograde on this one, but I will not use the pronoun \"they\" for a singular person. And I know that would mean I couldn\\'t get a faculty job! And I\\'m not sure if my volunteer gig at the Met museum is going to be in trouble because they, very much like universities, have given us instructions, pages and pages of instructions, on proper terminology - what terminology is favored or disfavored or should never be used, and \"they\" is in there. You can have circumlocutions so you can identify a single individual without using he or she if that individual - I mean you can\\'t even know what the individual\\'s preference is. So that\\'s another example of academic freedom threats from I guess you could call the left or the DEI establishment.\\n\\nThe right in American politics has a lot of material, a lot of ammunition to use when they criticize universities for being too politically correct and too \"woke.\" On the other hand, you have the anti-woke law in Florida which is really, as I said before, directed against education about the horrible racial history of this country. And some of those laws are just - whatever you may think about the ability of state government and state education departments to dictate curriculum and to dictate what viewpoints are going to be promoted in the curriculum - the Florida anti-woke law and don\\'t say gay law really go beyond I think any kind of discretion that the courts have said state and local governments have to determine curriculum.\\n\\nGreene: Are you surprised at all that we\\'re seeing that book bans are as big of a thing now as they were twenty years ago?\\n\\nWell, nothing surprises me. But yes, I would not have predicted that there were going to be the current incarnations of what you can remember from the old days, groups like the American Family Association, the Christian Coalition, the Eagle Forum, the groups that were \"culture warriors\" who were making a lot of headlines with their arguments forty years ago against even just having art that was done by gay people. We\\'ve come a long way from that, but now we have Moms for Liberty and present-day incarnations of the same groups. The homophobia agenda is a little more nuanced, it\\'s a little different from what we were seeing in the days of Jesse Helms in Congress. But the attacks on drag performances, this whole argument that children are going to be groomed to become drag queens or become gay -- that\\'s a little bit of a different twist, but it\\'s basically the same kind of homophobia. So it\\'s not surprising that it\\'s being churned up again if this is something that politicians think they can get behind in order to get elected. Or, let me put it another way, if the Moms for Liberty type groups make enough noise and seem to have enough political potency, then politicians are going to cater to them.\\n\\nAnd so the answer has to be groups on the other side that are making the free expression argument or the intellectual freedom argument or the argument that teachers and professors and librarians are the ones who should decide what books are appropriate. Those groups have to be as vocal and as powerful in order to persuade politicians that they don\\'t have to start passing censorship legislation in order to get votes.\\n\\nGreene: Going back to the college presidents and being grilled on the hill, you wrote that maybe there was, in response to the genocide question, which I think they were most sharply criticized there, that there was a better answer that they could have given. Could you talk about that?\\n\\nI think in that context, both for political reasons and for reasons of policy and free speech doctrine, the answer had to be that if students on campus are calling for genocide of Jews or any other ethnic or religious group that should not be permitted on campus and that amounts to racial harassment. Of course, I suppose you could imagine scenarios where two antisemitic kids in the privacy of their dorm room said this and nobody else heard it -- okay, maybe it doesn\\'t amount to racial harassment. But private colleges are not bound by the First Amendment. They all have codes of civility. Public colleges are bound by the First Amendment, but not the same standards as the public square. So I took the position that in that circumstance the presidents had to answer, \"Yes, that would violate our policies and subject a student to discipline.\" But that\\'s not the same as calling for the intifada or calling for even the elimination of the state of Israel as having been a mistake 75 years ago. So I got a little pushback on that little blog post that I wrote. And somebody said, \"I\\'m surprised a former ACLU lawyer is saying that calling for genocide could be punished on a college campus.\" But you know, the ACLU has many different political opinions within both the staff and Board. There were often debates on different kinds of free speech issues and where certain lines are drawn. And certainly on issues of harassment and when hate speech becomes harassment -- under what circumstances it becomes harassment. So, yes, I think that\\'s what they should have said. A lot of legal scholars, including David Cole of the ACLU, said they gave exactly the right answer, the legalistic answer, that it depends on the context. In that political situation that was not the right answer.\\n\\nGreene: It was awkward. They did answer as if they were having an academic discussion and not as if they were talking to members of Congress.\\n\\nWell they also answered as if they were programmed. I mean Claudine Gay repeated the exact same words that probably somebody had told her to say at least twice if not more. And that did not look very good. It didn\\'t look like she was even thinking for herself.\\n\\nGreene: I do think they were anticipating the followup question of, \"Well isn\\'t saying \\'From the River to the Sea\\' a call for genocide and how come you haven\\'t punished students for that?\" But as you said, that would then lead into a discussion of how we determine what is or is not a call for genocide.\\n\\nWell they didn\\'t need a followup question because to Elise Stefanik, \"Intifada\" or \"from the river to the sea\" was equivalent to a call for genocide, period, end of discussion. Let me say one more thing about these college hearings. What these presidents needed to say is that it\\'s very scary when politicians start interrogating college faculty or college presidents about curriculum, governance, and certainly faculty hires. One of the things that was going on there was they didn\\'t think there were enough conservatives on college faculties, and that was their definition of diversity. You have to push back on that, and say it is a real threat to academic freedom and all of the values that we talk about that are important at a university education when politicians start getting their hands on this and using funding as a threat and so forth. They needed to say that.\\n\\nGreene: Let\\'s pull back and talk about free speech principles more broadly. Why is, after many years of work in this area, why do you think free expression is important?\\n\\nWhat is the value of free expression more globally? [laughs] A lot of people have opined on that.\\n\\nGreene: Why is it important to you personally?\\n\\nWell I define it pretty broadly. So it doesn\\'t just include political debate and discussion and having all points of view represented in the public square, which used to be the narrower definition of what the First Amendment meant, certainly according to the Supreme Court. But the Court evolved. And so it\\'s now recognized, as it should be, that free expression includes art. The movies -- it doesn\\'t even have to be verbal -- it can be dance, it can be abstract painting. All of the arts, which feed the soul, are part of free expression. And that\\'s very important to me because I think it enriches us. It enriches our intellects, it enriches our spiritual lives, our emotional lives. And I think it goes without saying that political expression is crucial to having a democracy, however flawed it may be.\\n\\nGreene: You mentioned earlier that you don\\'t consider yourself to be a free speech absolutist. Do you consider yourself to be a maximalist or an enthusiast? What do you see as being sort of legitimate restrictions on any individual\\'s freedom of expression?\\n\\nWell, we mentioned this at the beginning. There are a lot of exceptions to the First Amendment that are legitimate and certainly, when I started at the ACLU I thought that defamation laws and libel and slander laws violate the first amendment. Well, I\\'ve changed my opinion. Because there\\'s real harm that gets caused by libel and slander. As we know, the Supreme Court has put some First Amendment restrictions around those torts, but they\\'re important to have. Threats are a well-recognized exception to the freedom of speech, and the kind of harm caused by threats, even if they\\'re not followed through on, is pretty obvious. Incitement becomes a little trickier because where do you draw the lines? But at some point an incitement to violent action I think can be restricted for obvious reasons of public safety. And then we have restrictions on false advertising but, of course, if we\\'re not in the commercial context, the Supreme Court has told us that lies are protected by the First Amendment. That\\'s probably wise just in terms of not trying to get the government and the judicial process involved in deciding what is a lie and what isn\\'t. But of course that\\'s done all the time in the context of defamation and commercial speech. Hate speech is something, as we know, that\\'s prohibited in many parts of Europe but not here. At least not in the public square as opposed to employment contexts or educational contexts. Some people would say, \"Well, that\\'s dictated by the First Amendment and they don\\'t have the First Amendment over there in Europe, so we\\'re better.\" But having worked in this area for a long time and having read many Supreme Court decisions, it seems to me the First Amendment has been subjected to the same kind of balancing test that they use in Europe when they interpret their European Convention on Human Rights or their individual constitutions. They just have different policy choices. And the policy choice to prohibit hate speech given the history of Europe is understandable. Whether it is effective in terms of reducing racism, Islamophobia, antisemitism... is there more of that in Europe than there is here? Hard to know. It\\'s probably not that effective. You make martyrs out of people who are prosecuted for hate speech. But on the other hand, some of it is very troubling. In the United States Holocaust denial is protected.\\n\\nGreene: Can you talk a little bit about your experience being a woman advocating for first amendment rights for sexual expression during a time when there was at least some form of feminist movement saying that some types of sexualization of women was harmful to women?\\n\\nThat drove a wedge right through the feminist movement for quite a number of years. There\\'s still some of that around, but I think less. The battle against pornography has been pretty much a losing battle.\\n\\nGreene: Are there lessons from that time? You were clearly on one side of it, are there lessons to be learned from that when we talk about sort of speech harms?\\n\\nOne of the policy reports we did at the Free Expression Policy Project was on media literacy as an alternative to censorship. Media literacy can be expanded to encompass a lot of different kinds of education. So if you had decent sex education in this country and kids were able to think about the kinds of messages that you see in commercial pornography and amateur pornography, in R-rated movies, in advertising -- I mean the kind of sexist messages and demeaning messages that you see throughout the culture -- education is the best way of trying to combat some of that stuff.\\n\\nGreene: Okay, our final question that we ask everyone. Who is your free speech hero?\\n\\nWhen I started working on \"Priests of our Democracy\" the most important case, sort of the culmination of the litigation that took place challenging loyalty programs and loyalty oaths, was a case called Keyishian v. Board of Regents. This is a case in which Justice Brennan, writing for a very slim majority of five Justices, said academic freedom is \"a special concern of the First Amendment, which does not tolerate laws that cast a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom.\" Harry Keyishian was one of the five plaintiffs in this case. He was one of five faculty members at the University of Buffalo who refused to sign what was called the Feinberg Certificate, which was essentially a loyalty oath. The certificate required all faculty to say \"I\\'ve never been a member of the Communist Party and if I was, I told the President and the Dean all about it.\" He was not a member of the Communist Party, but as Harry said much later in an interview - because he had gone to college in the 1950s and he saw some of the best professors being summarily fired for refusing to cooperate with some of these Congressional investigating committees - fast forward to the Feinberg Certificate loyalty oath: he said his refusal to sign was his \"revenge on the 1950s.\" And so he becomes the plaintiff in this case that challenges the whole Feinberg Law, this whole elaborate New York State law that basically required loyalty investigations of every teacher in the public system. So Harry became my hero. I start my book with Harry. The first line in my book is, \"Harry Keyishian was a junior at Queen\\'s College in the Fall of 1952 when the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee came to town.\" And he\\'s still around. I think he just had his 90th birthday!'}, {'topic': 'Race Bilingual', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech and racial issues in bilingual communities', 'title': 'Waterloo Human Rights Commissions denounces racism after flyer distribution', 'url': 'https://wcfcourier.com/news/local/crime-courts/waterloo-racist-hate-crimes-human-rights/article_ae45ea0a-ab6b-11ef-9b55-272908044e1d.html', 'published_date': '2024-11-27T12:10:53Z', 'source': 'Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier', 'content': 'WATERLOO -- The city continues to condemn hate speech that has become seemingly more prevalent in the Cedar Valley over the past year.\\n\\nThe Waterloo Human Rights Commission held a press conference Tuesday responding to flyers distributed in Waterloo and Evansdale earlier this month asking people to join a neo-Nazi group.\\n\\nPapers from the Aryan Freedom Network were placed on doorsteps by disguised individuals around 1 a.m. on Nov. 11.

Some claim they ended up 100 miles away in Grimsby. According to reports in The Travellers\\' Times and national press, children were assaulted in the process.\\n\\nThe police have been criticized for \"racial profiling,\" violating children\\'s physical safety, and undermining their dignity and human rights. Despite public outcry after videos of the train deportation and other flare-ups between police and the GRT communities surfaced on social media, no justification has been provided, and the officers involved remain in their posts.\\n\\nBy many metrics the most marginalized communities in the UK, the incident has been framed by GRT people as part of a broader, ingrained targeting of them by authorities, society, and the media -- some of whom took the extra step of organizing a protest in London this past weekend.\\n\\n\"Seeing the police brutality -- the boy held down, with pressure on his neck -- was horrifying,\" said Laura Collins, a GRT activist who organized the demonstration in Parliament Square last Saturday, November 30. \"For any mother, regardless of being a Traveller, you should be outraged.\" Her words resonated with the small but impassioned crowd in front of Westminster.\\n\\nStephanie McDonagh, a prominent advocate for GRT rights, stated, \"What happened in Manchester is not just a one-off. It\\'s part of a long history of mistreatment and prejudice against our people.\"\\n\\nResearch by The Traveller Movement reveals that Gypsies, Roma, and Travellers are more likely to face racial assaults than any other ethnic group in the UK. In 2023 alone, 62 percent of Gypsies and Travellers, and 47 percent of Roma people, reported experiencing a racial assault. Yet, less than 15 percent of these hate crimes are ever reported, reflecting a deep mistrust of law enforcement.\\n\\nThis mistrust is not unwarranted. \"There have been other cases where members of our community were brutally treated by those in authority, even losing their lives, and yet the CPS won\\'t act,\" Collins said. In the case of the Manchester incident, the failure to suspend or investigate the officers involved only reinforces perceptions of impunity.\\n\\nMary K. Foy -- the chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Gypsies, Travellers, and Roma -- has written to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper MP, calling for a full investigation. Yet, as of now, the police officers involved have not been held to account.\\n\\nIn fact, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham defended GMP\\'s actions during a BBC Radio Manchester phone-in, citing intelligence on potential anti-social behavior. \"Everyone has got a place in our city-region as long as people are coming to abide by the law,\" he said, denying accusations of racism. However, community members argue his justification ignores the discriminatory targeting of a specific group based on stereotypes rather than evidence.\\n\\nHistorically, GRT people have been pushed to the fringes of society, denied basic rights, and subjected to violent persecution. They have often been framed as a \"problem\" in media that must be \"managed,\" further entrenching prejudices.\\n\\nOne protester, \\'JR,\\' founder of the Gypsy Traveller League, reflected on this issue: \"[The TV show] Big Fat Gypsy Weddings destroyed us. It was a big downfall. These types of programs are not helping -- they\\'re just looking for money.\" Such portrayals distort public perception, reinforcing prejudice and fueling discrimination.\\n\\nJR\\'s own children shared his experiences. His young daughter said, \"It makes me feel sad because it\\'s not really nice for us... not serving people who\\'s having family-time stuff because they hear our voices and what we sound like.\"\\n\\nDespite these challenges, grassroots movements are fighting back. The #StopTravellerHate campaign, launched by The Traveller Movement, is calling for an end to the online hate speech that disproportionately targets GRT communities. Online hate speech against GRT people accounts for 15 percent of all racist or discriminatory slurs in the UK, and this figure is growing. Activists are working tirelessly to challenge these hate-filled narratives and demand greater protections for GRT individuals both online and offline.\\n\\nAdvocates are pushing for stronger hate crime reporting mechanisms, as GRT people often avoid the police out of distrust. Bias is pervasive; an ex-pub chain employee at the protest revealed, \"They\\'ve got a code word for us. They call us \\'Jelly Babies.\\'\" As JR put it, \"We\\'re constantly fighting against these stereotypes that have been put on us, and it\\'s exhausting. But we keep fighting, because that\\'s all we can do.\"\\n\\nFor many, the Manchester incident was a painful reminder of the past. \"Seven security attacked Michael McDonagh because he was an Irish Traveller,\" recalled Stephanie McDonagh, speaking powerfully about her father\\'s own experiences with police brutality. \"He was targeted. They held him to the ground and put a restraint on his neck. Over 150 witnesses came forward. Many said they heard Dad call out that he couldn\\'t breathe, but they didn\\'t lift the restraint from his neck.\" Despite the overwhelming evidence, no one has been charged or prosecuted for his death at Parkdean holiday resort in Camber Sands in 2022.\\n\\nMcDonagh claims that when she and her siblings tried to hand out leaflets asking for witnesses to come forward, staff at the resort tried to prevent them from doing so. (A spokesman for the resort said they \"do not recognize\" these allegations.) This suppression of evidence and refusal to hold those responsible to account underscores the systemic nature of anti-Traveller oppression in the UK. \"If this happened to anyone else, it would be all over the media. But when it\\'s Travellers, it\\'s ignored,\" she added.\\n\\nThese personal accounts highlight the deep emotional and psychological toll that racial discrimination takes on individuals within the GRT community. The trauma of being constantly targeted, dehumanized, and denied basic rights is an inescapable part of their lived reality.\\n\\nAs protest organizers and community leaders have argued, it isn\\'t enough to acknowledge the discrimination facing the GRT community. \"There\\'s an embedded institutional prejudice that\\'s not being addressed at the root,\" Collins said. \"We need people from our community in leadership roles -- not as tokens but as actual contributors -- to teach, reform, and add to the policies that impact us.\" Another protester summed up the urgency: \"We need society to listen to our people, to imprint our voices in policies and laws. We need to be trained and supported to access leadership roles, to be in the rooms where decisions are made.\"\\n\\nFor the GRT community, the fight is ongoing, the struggle far from over. \"We need more people to stand with us, to speak out, and not just when it\\'s convenient. This fight is for everyone, not just for us. We\\'re all in this together,\" one protester urged.\\n\\nIn the words of grandmother and protester, Noreen Ward, \"We are all human. We come into this world the same way, and we leave it the same way. We all need to respect one another.\"\\n\\nThe events in Manchester, and the painful stories shared by members of the GRT community, highlight the urgent need for real change to come. Until it does, the voices of the GRT community will continue to demand justice, respect, and equality.'}, {'topic': 'Race Bilingual', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech and racial issues in bilingual communities', 'title': 'Yvette Cooper plans to expand non-crime hate incidents despite Pearson row', 'url': 'https://www.yahoo.com/news/yvette-cooper-plans-expand-non-203115927.html', 'published_date': '2024-11-22T20:39:14Z', 'source': 'Yahoo', 'content': 'The Home Secretary is planning to expand the recording of non-crime hate incidents despite the backlash over the threat to free speech.\\n\\nYvette Cooper is committed to reversing the Tories\\' decision to downgrade the monitoring of the incidents, specifically in relation to anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, so they can be logged by police.\\n\\nLabour believes the current guidance to forces prevents officers from tracking tensions involving Jewish and Muslim communities that could escalate into violence and criminality.\\n\\nIt comes amid calls by senior Tory MPs to scrap the requirement for police to record non-crime crime hate incidents (NCHI) or further restrict the ability of officers to log them to protect free speech in the wake of the Allison Pearson row.\\n\\nA Home Office source said: \"It is part of our manifesto commitment so we will work with the College of Policing to understand the best way of doing that so police can assess where there is a high incidence of anti-Semitic and Islamophobic hate crime.\"\\n\\nPearson, an award-winning writer for The Telegraph, was being investigated by Essex Police for allegedly stirring up racial hatred with a social media post made in November last year. The force dropped the case on Thursday.\\n\\nWhile Pearson was being investigated for an alleged crime, she initially thought an NCHI was being recorded against her. The case prompted criticism of NCHIs, which do not meet the criminal threshold but are recorded by police regardless.\\n\\nSpeaking on Radio 4\\'s PM, Pearson said: \"The issue here is these non-crime hate incidents are out of control. Nobody with great knowledge of the law has ever suggested that there was any basis for charging me with anything.\\n\\n\"And we have to ask the question, why did Essex police persist in this? Why did they escalate it with me? I did not incite racial hate, nobody thinks I incited racial hate.\\n\\n\"I feel I was bullied and threatened, and this was wholly disproportionate. I won\\'t censor myself, but I will be more watchful in future.\"\\n\\nThe plans to expand the recording of NCHI were first revealed in the summer but have recently come under fresh scrutiny.\\n\\nFree speech campaigners are also threatening to take legal action against the Home Office if it goes ahead with plans to unpick rules laid down by the former home secretary Suella Braverman to stop police recording incidents just because someone was offended.\\n\\nThe rules, introduced last year, limited officers to recording personal data for NCHIs only where there was a \"real risk of significant harm\" to individuals or groups and a real risk that a future criminal offence could be committed against them.\\n\\nHowever, a report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in September found many forces were still failing to correctly apply the guidance.\\n\\nIt uncovered evidence that confusion over the rules meant officers were taking a risk-averse approach summed up as \"if in doubt, record\". As a result, NCHIs were too often being logged for complaints that amounted to little more than people\\'s \"hurt feelings\".\\n\\nPolice have recorded a non-crime hate incident after a person refused to shake hands, which the victim \"perceived to be hate related due to gender identity\".\\n\\nThey also logged a \"rough\" haircut reported by a customer who claimed his barber was \"aggressive\" following a discussion about the Ukraine war.\\n\\nMs Cooper has urged police to use \"common sense\" when recording non-crime hate incidents and has pointed to recommendations by the HM inspectorate for improved training and clearer direction for officers.\\n\\nA Home Office source said: \"We support the Inspectorate and College of Policing assessment that there needs to be a common sense and consistent approach - that means that trivial, irrational or malicious cases should not be recorded.\\n\\n\"The Inspectorate has been clear that guidance is not being followed consistently and we\\'ll be working with them and the College of Policing to make sure that the recommendations are implemented.\\n\\n\"Over the past 12 months there has been a big increase in anti-Semitism and Islamophobia and it\\'s really important that police forces are able to track and monitor that so that action can be taken to prevent harassment, crime or serious threats.\"\\n\\nLabour believes it can amend the guidelines to boost the recording of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia without changing the wider requirements to follow a common sense approach and not to record trivial or irrational incidents.\\n\\n\"Squaring the circle is what we are looking at mechanisms to do,\" said a Home Office source, although they added that it was not being actively pursued at the moment.\\n\\nA No 10 spokesman said Sir Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister, was clear that the police should be spending their time protecting the public and keeping streets safe.\\n\\n\"When it comes to those incidents we\\'ve also said that it\\'s vital we carefully consider how we balance the fundamental right to free speech and how police can gather information where relevant. We\\'re looking at how we can best ensure this is the case and will set out next steps in due course,\" said the spokesman.\\n\\nThe Free Speech Union (FSU) and former police officer Harry Miller, chief executive of campaign group Fair Cop, have written to Ms Cooper threatening legal action if there is any loosening of the guidance on NCHIs.\\n\\nThe guidance was re-written by the Home Office and College of Policing under Mrs Braverman after Mr Miller won a Court of Appeal challenge over a police investigation into his tweets. The judges ruled the old NCHI guidance had been wrongly used and had a \"chilling effect\" on his freedom of speech.\\n\\nToby Young, director of the FSU, said: \"The reason Suella Braverman tried to circumscribe the recording and retention of NCHIs isn\\'t because, as a Tory, she has more tolerance for anti-Semitic and Islamophobic hatred than the lovely and caring Yvette Cooper.\\n\\n\"It\\'s because the Court of Appeal in Miller vs College of Policing ruled that the guidance devised by the College, and the behaviour of the police in their efforts to comply with it, was unlawful.\\n\\n\"If Yvette Cooper scraps the statutory guidance and encourages the police to record even more NCHIs, she will be ordering them to go back to breaking the law.

Despite this diversity, the Hindu majority has made life for everyone else very uncomfortable. Minorities such as Dalits, Muslims, and Christians face discrimination in employment, education, and access to essential services. This has led to a lack of economic and social opportunities for these communities, contributing to poverty and marginalization.\\n\\nAnother significant issue is the rise of communal violence and religious hatred. In recent years, there has been a surge in violence and religious clashes, mainly targeting minorities. This has led to widespread fear and insecurity among these communities and has caused significant harm to their homes, businesses, and places of worship.\\n\\nMuslims make up roughly 13 per cent of India\\'s population of 1.1 billion, and their numbers are nearly equal to the entire population of Pakistan, which was carved out of British India almost 60 years ago as the homeland of the subcontinent\\'s Muslims. Soul-searching about Muslim rights and well-being in India, which has witnessed periodic outbreaks of religious violence, has been a leitmotif ever since.\\n\\nTensions between Hindus and Muslims in India are not new, but they have gotten worse under Modi, whose ruling Bharatiya Janata Party touts a Hindu-nationalist ideology. And with Modi seemingly on the cusp of a third five-year term, the outlook for Muslim politicians - and citizens - is bleak.\\n\\nIt\\'s not just that Modi has ramped up anti-Muslim rhetoric in campaign speeches. Ever since the BJP began its rise as a political force in the mid-1980s, the proportion of Muslim lawmakers in parliament and state legislatures has shrunk.\\n\\nMuslim representation has fallen in the ruling BJP and in opposition parties, too. When Modi assumed power in 2014, the outgoing parliament had 30 Muslim lawmakers - and just one was a member of the BJP. Muslims now hold 25 out of 543 seats, and none belong to the BJP.\\n\\nIndia has gone from being a country where it marginalized Muslims but who are now slowly they are being \"actively excluded,\"\\n\\n\"Without representation, you are unable to ask the state for resources and articulate the kind of needs the community has in order to progress, whether its education, jobs, health or basic infrastructure,\" Mahmudabad said.\\n\\nIn the mid-1980s, Muslims accounted for 11% of India\\'s population and had 9% of seats in parliament; today, they are 14% of the population and have less than 5% of seats in parliament.\\n\\nNine out of 10 members of parliament are Hindus, who make up 80 per cent of India\\'s population of 1.4 billion. The political representation of Muslims at the state level is only slightly better. India has more than 4,000 lawmakers in state legislatures across 28 states, and Muslim lawmakers hold roughly 6% of these seats.\\n\\nA government report in 2006 found Muslims lagged Hindus, Christians and people from India\\'s lower castes in literacy, income and access to education. They have made some gains since then but are still at a significant disadvantage, according to multiple independent studies.\\n\\nUnder Modi\\'s decade in power, the BJP has enacted or proposed various laws that Muslim leaders consider discriminatory.\\n\\n- Some states ruled by the BJP passed laws restricting interfaith marriage as a way to address what they claim is the threat posed by Hindu women marrying Muslim men and then converting.\\n\\n- One state formerly ruled by the BJP banned girls from wearing hijabs in school. (The law was reversed after the BJP lost political control.)\\n\\n- The BJP is advocating a standard legal code that would affect some religious practices by changing some laws in India\\'s Constitution that deal with matters ranging from marriage to divorce and inheritance.\\n\\nViolence against Muslims is commonplace, and Modi has said little to deter it. Muslims have been lynched by Hindu mobs over allegations of eating beef or smuggling cows, an animal considered holy to Hindus. Their homes and businesses have been bulldozed, and their places of worship set on fire.\\n\\nAt recent campaign rallies, Modi has said Muslims are \"infiltrators\" and that they \"have too many children.\" Without evidence, he has accused the BJP\\'s main rival, the Congress party, of planning to redistribute the wealth of Hindus to Muslims. Many Muslims believe Modi is stoking divisions as a campaign strategy. But who will speak up? If they do, they may be picked up (by police), or a bulldozer will be sent to their homes,\" said Khatri. \"So out of fear, nobody speaks up.\" Not one of India\\'s 28 states has a Muslim as chief minister; the BJP and its allies have chief ministers in 19 states.\\n\\nIn Uttar Pradesh, the country\\'s most populous state and where roughly 16% of residents are Muslim, just 7% of state lawmakers are Muslim. As the BJP becomes ever more powerful, India\\'s opposition parties have become increasingly reluctant to nominate Muslim candidates for fear of alienating Hindu voters, experts say.\\n\\nWhile Hindus overwhelmingly rally around the BJP, Muslims have struggled to form a cohesive political agenda, in part because of how diverse their community is across sects, ethnicities, languages, customs, and cultures.\\n\\nAnalysts say the BJP has made some outreach efforts to Muslims, such as seeking their help as volunteers and at the polls. The party fielded just 13 Muslim candidates combined in the 2014 and 2019 elections, and none were elected. The BJP denies discriminating against Muslim people.\\n\\nThe party \"permits accommodation of all kinds of people, not just the Hindus,\" said M Abdul Salam, the only Muslim out of some 430 BJP candidates running for parliament this year. If he wins, he will become the first Muslim member of the BJP since 2014 in India\\'s lower house of the parliament.\\n\\nSalam, who is from the Muslim-majority southern city of Malappuram, said Muslim politicians from other parties could gain power by joining the BJP\\'s alliance in parliament. But Muslims\\n\\n.Fair representation of every community is suitable for democracy, but one community is gradually being pushed out of the mainstream,\\n\\nThe treatment of Muslims has been a matter of concern in recent years, with reports of discrimination, hate crimes, and violence against this community. There are several reasons why this is the case, including the rise of extremism and the spread of communal hatred.\\n\\nOne reason is the rise of Hindu nationalism, which has led to a toxic political environment where religious and ethnic minorities are a threat to the dominant Hindu majority. This has resulted in the spread of anti-Muslim sentiment and the proliferation of hate speech and violence against Muslims.\\n\\nAnother factor is the spread of misinformation and propaganda, which often reinforces negative stereotypes about Muslims and portrays them as a threat to national security and the Hindu way of life. This has contributed to a hostile and dangerous environment for Muslims and has led to widespread fear and insecurity.\\n\\nExtremism is also a significant factor contributing to the mistreatment of Muslims. The presence of extremist groups who promote hate and violence against religious and ethnic minorities has created an environment of fear and insecurity for these communities. These groups often use hate speech, propaganda, and violence to spread their message, further exacerbating tensions and leading to an increase in hate crimes and violence against Muslims.\\n\\nRight-wing extremist organizations like the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are promoting fascist and authoritarian tendencies through their policies and actions. Indian democracy is eroding over time as a result of widespread public misunderstanding and the suppression of debate over Hindutva\\'s fascist roots. The Bharatiya Janata Party, India\\'s governing party, has never been able to distance itself from debates over the rights of minorities, particularly Muslims.\\n\\nWhile Hindutva organizations have mainly targeted Muslims, they are regrettably not the only ones. Because of pro-Hindu propaganda, Muslims, Christians, and Sikhs are left at the mercy of an authoritarian government to protect their fundamental rights. With the dubious assistance of Hindutva organizations, Narendra Modi\\'s government has consistently repressed the proponents of Khalistan in India.\\n\\nSome BJP leaders have made controversial remarks and statements that suggest a preference for Hindu culture and traditions over other religious traditions. Even the media is often censored, while Article 19 of India\\'s Constitution, which deals with freedom of speech, is ignored. Following the horrific anti-Muslim riots that took place in New Delhi in February 2020, when Muslims protesting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) had to undergo torture at the hands of Hindu gangs, the government suspended a television channel and another for 48 hours following the riots.\\n\\nAfter the BBC ran stories that painted the BJP government and Modi in a negative light, the government raided their offices. The Guardian reports: \"BBC offices in India have been raided by tax department officials, just weeks after the release of a documentary critical of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, which the government later blocked. According to those working at the broadcaster, more than a dozen officials from the country\\'s income tax department turned up at the BBC offices in Delhi and Mumbai, where hundreds of employees are based, to conduct a \\'survey.\\n\\nThe BJP is actively cracking down on free speech and dissent, particularly on social media. There have been cases of journalists being arrested or harassed for reporting critical stories, and there have been efforts to control the narrative in mainstream media.\\n\\nThe BJP is implementing policies that target Muslims, such as the controversial CAA, which fast-tracks citizenship for non-Muslim immigrants from neighbouring countries. The party has also been accused of being complicit in anti-Muslim violence, particularly in the state of Gujarat in 2002. The BJP primarily seeks to control institutions such as the judiciary, media, and educational institutions to further its political agenda. This has led to concerns about the erosion of democratic norms and the independence of these institutions.\\n\\nInstances of mob violence and lynching have been carried out by individuals associated with or influenced by these organizations. For example, in September 2015, Mohammad Akhlaq, a Muslim man, was lynched by a mob in Dadri, Uttar Pradesh, over allegations of slaughtering a cow. Some of the accused individuals were associated with local RSS-affiliated organizations. Moreover, in June 2017, six men were lynched in 2016 in Jharkhand on suspicions of being child kidnappers. Some of the individuals were reportedly associated with the BJP or its youth wing.\\n\\nIn July 2018, Rakbar Khan, a Muslim man, was lynched by a mob in Alwar, Rajasthan, over allegations of cow smuggling. Some of the accused were reportedly associated with a local cow protection group with links to the BJP. In December 2018, a police officer and a civilian were killed in violent clashes in Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh, after a mob attacked a police team over allegations of cow slaughter. Some of the accused individuals were reportedly associated with the BJP.\\n\\nThe mistreatment of Muslims is a complex issue with multiple contributing factors, including the rise of extremism and Hindu nationalism, the spread of misinformation and propaganda, and the presence of extremist groups. the government needs to take action to address these issues, promote religious tolerance, and protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their religion or ethnicity.\\n\\nAn ethnic group is a collection of people who share a culture, a language, and a set of customs. Some ethnic communities banded together in the nineteenth century and declared their nation-states over the areas they occupied. These communities may be ethnically distinct from the rest of society, yet they seek to maintain their identity. They are a small group of people who are clearly different and unusual from the majority.\\n\\nIndia is a multi-religious, multicultural, multi-lingual, and multi-racial society with a unifying theme of peaceful coexistence and ethnic peace that binds us together. India\\'s social plurality is strengthened by the country\\'s unique constitutional ideas of secularism and tolerance. These ideas are enshrined under Article 30 and Article 29, which provide legal protection and promotion of any minority population\\'s rights. The Preamble of the Indian Constitution later defined secularism as its integral part. All minorities in the country are guaranteed fundamental rights. These rights are protected and promoted by independent institutions such as the judiciary, the Human Rights Commission, and the Minorities Commission.\\n\\nReservation of Minority Communities in the Indian Society 一\\n\\nThe protection of religious and ethnic minorities rights is fundamental to India\\'s secular ethos. One of the several clauses in the Indian Constitution that promotes minority rights reserving is Article 30. Article 30 provides guarantees to minorities\\' rights \"to construct and operate educational institutions,\" which aids the government in formulating policies for the success of the education of minorities. The advantage provided to Christian students\\' colleges was challenged in St. Stephen\\'s College v. University of Delhi. The court said that half of the seats would be designated for minorities in the selection process while the other half would be filled on the basis of merit.\\n\\nHowever, the TMA Pai Foundation lawsuit overturned this decision. The Apex Court ruled that unassisted establishments of institutions are not entitled to the state\\'s admission procedures since they do not receive any public funding from the state fund. It meant that schools might follow their admission policy, including administering their entrance exam, as long as the admission was on performance and the system was open and transparent. Similarly, they will the state\\'s fee systems should not restrain them as long as they do not solicit capitation fees. According to the court, the state now has the authority to set quotas for minority pupils. This decision distinguished between government involvement of private entities that are supported and independent.\\n\\nTime again, the Supreme Court ruled in P.A. Inamdar v. State of Maharashtra that the principle of student reservation does not apply to minority establishments of institutions. The government does not have the authority to make reservations in educational establishments. The admissions procedure may be based on an examination or upon merit. The Supreme Court concluded in Azeez Basha v. Union of India (Aligarh Muslim University Case) that a segment of the population has no authority to direct an educational institution that they did not create. According to the Act of Parliament, AMU is not really a minority institution. The terms \\'established\\' and \\'administered\\' must be interpreted carefully. In the case of Dr Naresh Agarwal v. UOI, the court overturned -- the status of minority to AMU.\\n\\nSum & Substance of Minority Groups in India\\n\\nA heritage of confrontations, as well as a dynamic staging ground for sectarian tensions and dissent, have rendered India susceptible to minorities on several grounds and chances. As a result, there is a need to protect their identity and minority rights on social, economic, and political levels. The Indian Constitution gives several avenues for minorities to preserve their rights. In order to maintain its democratic character, it also grants specific rights and freedoms to minorities. Minorities, on the other hand, are responsible for a slew of issues.\\n\\nSupreme Court and minority rights\\n\\nIndia has avowed itself to be a secular state. As a result, our Constitution\\'s spirit is secular. In India, all political leaders profess to be secular, but none of them actually implement it. In India, political parties play a prominent part in delegitimizing religious issues in order to get votes. Despite the fact that there are several difficulties of this nature, the answer lies in approaching with due consideration. Even yet, the court seems to be unable to define minority and has relied on the interpretation of the court based on the facts. Article 30 and Article 29 of the Indian Constitution have a widespread impact, and they must offer the minority portion of their entire freedom. The Supreme Court of India has always done its best to offer minorities the guarantees provided by the Constitution. The Constitution affords the country\\'s minorities ample safeguards for the safety and advancement of the minorities and minority institutions, all of which are guaranteed as fundamental rights. The rights supposedly conferred on the minorities are no more than rights aimed at making India a genuinely democratic secular country and to secure to its citizen\\'s justice -- social, economic, and political; liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship; equality of status and opportunity; and to promote fraternity among them all, assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation, so proudly proclaimed in the Constitution. Religion, language, and culture were the essential elements to be considered with reference to each state to determine the question of whether any section of the population was a minority. This chapter also discusses the constitutional rights accorded to minority educational institutions, including those related to reservations, admissions, appointment of teachers, and disciplinary control. They can run any institution that they see fit.\\n\\nIndia\\'s slide into fascism\\n\\nIndia is slowly sliding into fascism. The problem with \"fascism\" as a description of any modern political tendency is that the term is a weapon of mass destruction that flattens the landscapes that it wants to describe. Fascism is so freighted with historically specific meaning that using it for other times and places can seem sloppy and excessive. And yet, juxtaposing the politics of contemporary South Asia with fascism, in its Nazi variant, serves a double purpose: it connects modern Indian majoritarianism with one of its ideological ancestors, and it helps us name and identify the ideological kernel of fascism that survived to fight another day.\\n\\nIndia\\'s ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is the political arm of a Hindu militia, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), founded in 1925, around the time Adolf Hitler began to find his political bearings in a routed, angry Germany. The RSS is a nationalist militia that defines India as a Hindu nation; only Hindus can be members. While there are many similarities between the RSS and the fascist paramilitary organizations of the prewar decades, from uniformed drills and distinctive salutes to persistent anxiety about masculinity, at the core of both is a feral ethnic nationalism that aims to mobilize a racial or religious majority against an allegedly infringing minority.\\n\\nWe have become familiar with violence and discrimination directed at minority religious groups in India, particularly Muslims, through this last decade of majoritarian rule. Lynchings connected to the cattle trade, riots, the bulldozing of Muslim homes, and the criminalization of love between Hindu women and Muslim men via the bogey of \"love jihad\" have been features of Narendra Modi\\'s tenure as prime minister. But the German inspiration for the BJP\\'s short way with minorities goes back to the 1930s.'}], [{'topic': 'Religion Healing', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech in religious communities', 'title': \"UN Secretary-General's remarks at the opening session of the 10th United Nations Alliance of Civilizations Global Forum [bilingual as delivered; scroll down for all-English version]\", 'url': 'https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2024-11-26/un-secretary-generals-remarks-the-opening-session-of-the-10th-united-nations-alliance-of-civilizations-global-forum-bilingual-delivered-scroll-down-for-all-english', 'published_date': '2024-11-26T11:50:19Z', 'source': 'United Nations', 'content': 'Excelentíssimo Senhor Professor Doutor Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, Presidente da República Portuguesa,\\n\\nAgradeço a Vossa Excelência e ao Governo de Portugal, na pessoa do Senhor Ministro de Estado e dos Negócios Estrangeiros, a hospitalidade e o acolhimento deste Fórum Mundial da Aliança das Civilizações.\\n\\nCorrendo o risco de alguma falta de isenção, permito-me, aliás, felicitar a decisão de realizar este Fórum no meu país e no belo município de Cascais.\\n\\nPortugal é um país que compreende bem o valor da aproximação e do entendimento entre diferentes culturas e civilizações.\\n\\nSaúdo a presença de Sua Majestade o Rei Filipe VI de Espanha e o sinal de empenho na Aliança das Civilizações que a mesma presença representa.

This climate of hostility is characterized by systemic discrimination, violent assaults, and state-sanctioned actions against Muslim communities.\\n\\nRecently, Muslim victims have urged the Indian Supreme Court to intervene against the arbitrary demolition of properties owned by Muslims, a practice dubbed \"Bulldozer Justice\" that targets alleged illegal structures under the pretext of urban development. This trend reflects a broader pattern of violence and discrimination including the recent sentencing of Muslim converts under anti-conversion laws which stifles their religious freedom and autonomy.\\n\\nExperts from the third ministerial conference of Justice for All (JFA) have warned that rising Islamophobia could lead to genocide against Muslims in India. This sentiment is echoed in various protests such as those against housing for Muslim single mothers which reveal deep rooted institutionalized bigotry within Modi\\'s regime. The violent assaults on Muslims during Ramadan prayers at Gujarat University further illustrate their vulnerability in a country that claims to uphold secular values.\\n\\nIn Gujarat, Muslims face exclusion from housing in Hindu dominated areas, perpetuating a form of modern-day apartheid. The Indian government has suppressed dissenting voices from religious minorities through surveillance and harassment, often utilizing laws like the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) to stifle advocacy efforts. High profile BJP member Gyan Dev Ahuja have incited violence against Muslims by calling for the killing of anyone involved in slaughter of cow, which exacerbated communal tensions across states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\nViolent assaults on Muslims during Ramadan prayers at Gujarat University illustrate their vulnerability in a country that claims to uphold secular values.\\n\\nRenowned Bollywood actor turned BJP leader Mithun Chakraborty made ferocious statements cum threats against Muslims. He made a statement against a Muslim TMC leader stating \"If you throw in the Bhagirathi, we will also one day... not in the Bhagirathi because it is our mother... but we will bury you on the other side. Aap hamare jhaad ka ek fal todoge toh hum aapke jhaad ka char fal tod denge\"\\n\\nFurther he stated, \"In 2026 (the next Assembly elections), the masnad (throne) will be ours (the BJP\\'s) and we will do everything to achieve the goal... Kuch bhi karenge, kuch bhi. Main Home Minister sahab ke saamne bol raha hoon. Kuch bhi ke andar bahut sara matlab chupa hua hai\"\\n\\nRecent reports indicate a troubling rise in hate speech incidents against Muslims in India, particularly linked to the ruling Baharatiya Janata Party (BJP). A report by Hindutva Watch documented 255 incidents of hate speech targeting Muslims with approximately 80 percent of these incidents occurring in states governed by the BJP during the first half of 2023. A significant portion of documented hate speech incidents, approximately one-third, has been attributed to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and the Bajrang Dal.\\n\\nCIA has categorized both these groups as \"religious militant organizations\". Both VHP & Bajran Dal are linked to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) which serves as the ideological foundation for the Baharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This alarming situation highlights a significant trend in the politicization of communal tensions under Modi\\'s administration which has been criticized for fostering an environment where such rhetoric is increasingly normalized. Later on, BJP government has blocked platforms tracking hate crimes like Hindutva Watch and India Hate Lab under controversial IT act, 2000.\\n\\nSocial media plays a significant role in fueling Islamophobia with platforms facilitating the spread of hate speech and disinformation. Reports indicate that nearly two anti-Muslim hate speech incidents occur daily, with many linked to political campaigns led by the BJP. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) further marginalize Muslims by putting hundreds of thousands at risk of statelessness, particularly in Assam.\\n\\nThe destruction of property in predominantly Muslim neighborhoods has intensified under BJP rule, contributing to increased religious tensions. Civil society organizations have approached the Supreme Court to halt these demolitions and protect minority rights.\\n\\nThe international community is urged to demand action against rising Islamophobia and advocate for protective measures for minority communities in India. Furthermore, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) must organize campaigns addressing housing discrimination against Muslim single mothers and promote inclusive policies. World governing bodies should compel the Indian government to ensure protection for minorities during religious observances.\\n\\nThe plight of Muslim women illustrates an intersection of gender and religious discrimination as they face harassment at both local and state levels. The ongoing violence not only threatens their safety but also fuels existing inequalities within society.\\n\\nIn short, Islamophobia in India manifests through systemic discrimination, violent acts against Muslims, and state-supported initiatives that undermine their rights. The urgent need for civil society mobilization against discriminatory laws like the CAA and NRC is paramount to safeguarding citizenship rights for Muslims. As tensions rise, it is crucial for both domestic and international actors to advocate for justice and equality for all religious communities in India.'}, {'topic': 'Religion Healing', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech in religious communities', 'title': 'CJP files five complaints to Maharashtra State Election Commission, demands FIRs for MCC violation against hate offenders | SabrangIndia', 'url': 'https://sabrangindia.in/cjp-files-five-complaints-to-maharashtra-state-election-commission-demands-firs-for-mcc-violation-against-hate-offenders/', 'published_date': '2024-12-03T05:00:02Z', 'source': 'SabrangIndia', 'content': 'CJP Takes a Stand Against Hate: five complaints filed for MCC Violations across Maharashtra, demanding FIRs against Suresh Chavhanke, Harsha Thakur, and BJP MP Dhananjay Mahadik, for allegedly delivering anti-Muslim hate speech during the MCC period\\n\\nCitizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) has filed five complaints with the Maharashtra State Election Commission, alleging violations of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) in Kolhapur, Jalgaon, Pathanpura, Akola, and Delgur (Nanded). The complaints highlight hate speech delivered by habitual hate offenders during the election period, urging the Chief Election Officer (CEO) S. Chockalingam to direct registration of FIRs under Sections 123(2), 123(3), and 123(3A) of the Representation of People\\'s Act, 1951. Three of the complaints were filed against Suresh Chavhanke, the editor-in-chief of Sudarshan News, for his inflammatory speeches in Jalgaon (Nov 8), Akola (Nov 13), and Pathanpura (Nov 11). Another complaint accuses Harsha Thakur of making divisive comments in Delgur (Nanded) on October 29, while the fifth complaint involves BJP Rajya Sabha MP Dhananjay Mahadik for his communal speech during an election rally in Kolhapur. These actions, CJP claims, violated MCC guidelines and electoral laws.\\n\\nOn November 15, 2024, CJP filed a complaint before the CEO Maharashtra regarding the gross violation of MCC in Jalgaon, Maharashtra, due to the hate-filled rhetoric of Suresh Chavhanke. Chavhanke\\'s speech at the Janata-NRC event blatantly violated the MCC and undermined the principles of free and fair elections as pleaded by the CJP in its complaint. The said speech was delivered by Suresh Chavhanke at the Janta-NRC event on November 8, 2024, in Jalgaon, Maharashtra.\\n\\nIn his address, Chavhanke explicitly targeted Muslim citizens by misrepresenting Islamic symbols, falsely claiming that the crescent and star, often associated with Islam, belonged not to Islam but to the Muslim League, and linking it to the creation of Pakistan. He further propagated misinformation by associating the true Islamic flag with extremist ideologies. Referring to Muslims as \"infiltrators\" and calling for their removal to \"save Maharashtra,\" he sought to fuel communal tensions. Additionally, he promoted the baseless \"Vote Jihad\" conspiracy, accusing Muslims of using elections to wage a religious war, inciting division and hostility.\\n\\nCJP mentioned in its complaint that \"This statement is highly provocative and anti-Muslim because it labels Muslims as \"infiltrators\" and associates them with a threat to India\\'s integrity. The call to \"drive out the infiltrators\" implies that Muslims are unwelcome outsiders, fostering fear and hatred. The comparison of the saffron flag to the Tricolor and the assertion that without saffron, the Tricolor will \"turn green\" insinuates that Muslims, symbolized by green, pose a threat to national unity. Furthermore, the term \"vote Jihad\" equates Muslim political participation to religious warfare, encouraging communal hostility and framing elections as a religious battle, thus deepening divisions.\\n\\nThe video can be accessed through this link: https: https://t.me/hindutvawatchin/802\\n\\n2. Akola [November 13, 2024] & 3. Pathanpura (Mangrulpir) [November 11, 2024]\\n\\nSpeaker - Suresh Chavhanke\\n\\nOn November 21, 2024, CJP filed a complaint regarding the hate-filled speeches delivered by Suresh Chavhanke, editor-in-chief of Sudarshan News, in Akola and Pathanpura (Mangrulpir), Maharashtra. Chavhanke\\'s speeches, delivered on November 13, 2024, in Akola and November 11, 2024, in Pathanpura, contained clear examples of hate speech, particularly targeting the Muslim community. Throughout his speeches, Chavhanke used derogatory terms like \"love jihad,\" \"intruders,\" and \"jihadists,\" portraying Muslims as a threat to national security and fueling fear by labeling them as \"infiltrators\" from neighboring countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Myanmar.\\n\\nFurthermore, Chavhanke invoked historical figures such as \"Aurangzeb\" and \"Tipu Sultan\" to vilify Muslims, manipulating religious sentiments to create division. He also urged voters to support laws targeting Muslims, including \"cow protection\" and the baseless \"love jihad\" conspiracy. This inflammatory rhetoric was designed to incite hatred and polarize communities. CJP\\'s complaint highlighted that Chavhanke\\'s speeches violated the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) and sections 123(2), 123(3), and 123(3A) of the Representation of the People Act (RP Act), 1951, which prohibit hate speech and the incitement of religious division during election periods, as per CJP\\'s complaint.\\n\\nCJP said in its complaint that, \"By linking political choices to religious identity and inciting voters to act against Muslim communities, the speaker attempts to polarize the election along religious lines. The call to vote based on laws like \"love jihad\" or \"cow protection\" further encourages discrimination, suggesting that the Muslim community is responsible for crimes against Hindu women or society. This creates a hostile, divisive atmosphere, undermining the principles of free and fair elections.\"\\n\\nOn November 21, 2024, CJP filed a complaint regarding the anti-Muslim and communal hate speech delivered by right-wing leader Harsha Thakur at a public event in Delgur, Nanded, Maharashtra. Thakur, campaigning for independent Hindu nationalist candidate Dr. Virupaksha Maharaj, made inflammatory remarks that blatantly violated the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) and undermined free and fair elections. On October 29, 2024, Thakur\\'s speech contained divisive rhetoric, calling for Hindus to avoid supporting those who allegedly sided with other religious communities.\\n\\nShe warned that if Sharia law were implemented, valuable land would be transferred to the Waqf Board, inciting fear and communal tension. Thakur further urged voters to prioritize religious unity over caste-based voting. Her comments, intended to stoke division, violated MCC provisions by inciting religious hatred and manipulating religious sentiments for electoral gain. CJP emphasized that these statements contravened Sections 123(2), 123(3), and 123(3A) of the Representation of the People Act (RP Act), 1951.\\n\\nAccording to CJP\\'s complaint in her speech, Thakur urged voters that, \"Don\\'t vote for a candidate who gives employment to Muslims!\" and further stated, \"India will never work on Sharia law,\" while also spreading unfounded fears about the Waqf Board. This rhetoric is not only inflammatory but also divisive, promoting religious intolerance and fear-mongering. By appealing to voters on religious lines and stoking fear about Muslims and their institutions, Thakur\\'s speech creates a dangerous environment of communal polarization.\"\\n\\nThe video can be accessed through this link: https: https://t.me/hindutvawatchin/825\\n\\nOn November 15, 2024, CJP approached the CEO Maharashtra with a complaint against BJP Rajya Sabha MP Dhananjay Mahadik, following his controversial remarks at a rally in Kolhapur, Maharashtra. In a video that surfaced, Mahadik was seen instructing party workers to target women beneficiaries of the Ladki Bahini Yojana attending Congress rallies. He directed his supporters to photograph or film these women and report back to him. His statement, \"I will teach those women a lesson,\" was a clear attempt to intimidate and surveil women based on their political affiliations. These actions were seen as an explicit violation of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) and the Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1951.\\n\\nCJP argued that Mahadik\\'s directive not only threatened women\\'s rights to political participation but also used a government welfare scheme intended for empowerment as a tool for political control. The complaint called for immediate action under electoral laws to address this form of intimidation.\\n\\nThe video can be accessed through this link: https://x.com/HateDetectors/status/1856274208646672512\\n\\nNotably, CJP played a pivotal role in monitoring the assembly elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, vigilantly flagging complaints of hate speech and violations of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC). Their persistent efforts resulted in the registration of FIRs against Suresh Chavhanke and Kajal Hindustani in Maharashtra for delivering inflammatory speeches that breached MCC guidelines.\\n\\nRelated:\\n\\nCJP files 3 MCC violation complaints with CEO Maharashtra against Suresh Chavhanke for hate speech\\n\\nCJP\\'s fight against Hate: FIR filed against Suresh Chavhanke for Hate Speech at Karad event'}, {'topic': 'Religion Healing', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech in religious communities', 'title': 'CEC contributed to European Parliament discussion on combating hate speech | CEC Europe', 'url': 'https://ceceurope.org/cec-contributed-european-parliament-discussion-combating-hate-speech', 'published_date': '2024-11-29T14:00:27Z', 'source': 'CEC', 'content': 'The Conference of European Churches (CEC) contributed to a significant discussion on combating hate speech during a hearing titled \"Why Words Matter: An Interreligious Perspective to Combating Hate Speech,\" held at the European Parliament on 19 November.

Incidentally, the latter are among the most serious offenders when it comes to this.\\n\\nGuterres also pushed a UN-backed censorship initiative during the three-day forum in his home country of Portugal. According to critics, this initiative introduces algorithmic censorship and demonetization under the scope of \"anti-misinformation and hate speech\" as per the UN\\'s Global Principles for Information Integrity. He argued that these recommendations allow for \"a more humane information ecosystem.\"\\n\\nGovernment leaders unanimously adopted the Cascais Declaration, with many of them being \"alarmed\" at the global spread of \"disinformation, misinformation and hate speech\" both online and offline. The document binds them to combating these while strengthening \"information integrity.\" However, the declaration does not define any of these terms and does not lay out any methods to fight them.\\n\\n\"We must [rein] in hate speech and misinformation spreading online. Hate-filled frenzies are perpetuating stereotypes and misconceptions,\" Guterres told attendees of the UNAOC forum. He continued that misinformation and \"outright lies\" are \"fueling repulsive antisemitism, anti-Muslim bigotry and attacks on minority Christian communities.\"\\n\\n\"Unchecked digital platforms and artificial intelligence (AI) have endowed hate speech with a speed and reach unseen before, [and] many times they lead to violence. With the proliferation of deepfakes, the impossible and the unverified become credible in an instant.\"\\n\\nThe calls for censorship are lumped in with recognition of \"sports diplomacy as a tool for promoting dialogue,\" support for women as \"negotiators, mediators and peacemakers\" and protection for religious sites, as well as \"the potential use of artificial intelligence as a tool to advance intercultural and inter-religious dialogue.\"\\n\\nTrump\\'s FCC chairman pick vows to dismantle leftist disinformation cartel.\\n\\nCenter for Countering Digital Hate facing collapse after its \"black operations\" against Americans are exposed.\\n\\nMajor advertisers in the \"censorship cartel\" set to return to Elon Musk\\'s X as they seek to curry favor with Trump.\\n\\nFOIA requests unearth documents exposing NIH\\'s massive censorship cartel during the COVID-19 pandemic.'}, {'topic': 'Religion Healing', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech in religious communities', 'title': \"Suresh Chavhanke booked under s 123(3A) of RPA for violating MCC following CJP's complaint | SabrangIndia\", 'url': 'https://sabrangindia.in/suresh-chavhanke-booked-under-s-1233a-of-rpa-for-violating-mcc-following-cjps-complaint/', 'published_date': '2024-12-02T12:35:19Z', 'source': 'SabrangIndia', 'content': 'On November 21, 2024, Karad Police in Maharashtra registered an FIR against Suresh Chavhanke and event organizers Vaibhav Dubal and Rupesh Kumar, following a complaint filed by Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP). The complaint, submitted on November 11, accused Chavhanke of delivering a hate-filled, anti-Muslim speech at the Janata-NRC event on October 22, 2024. CJP\\'s complaint highlighted how the speech violated the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) by inciting religious hatred and political division. Chavhanke has been booked under Section 123(3A) of the Representation of People Act, 1951, for violating MCC during the event, with FIR No. 1544 of 2024 filed.\\n\\nThe Event and the Complaint\\n\\nThe Janata-NRC event, organized on October 22, 2024 by the right-wing outfit Sakal Hindu Samaj in Karad, was the venue for Chavhanke\\'s controversial address. The CJP complaint highlighted that Chavhanke\\'s speech, laden with Islamophobic and divisive content, not only violated ethical standards of political discourse but also breached the MCC, which governs the conduct of political leaders during the election period.\\n\\nIn the speech, Chavhanke allegedly claimed that Europe would soon cease to exist due to a Muslim takeover, making inflammatory statements about the growing Muslim population in India. He further propagated the debunked \"love jihad\" conspiracy theory and stated that India was at risk from \"10 crore infiltrators,\" referring to Muslims as a threat to Hindu culture and suggesting that they should be expelled from the country. These remarks, according to the CJP, were designed to create fear, manipulate public sentiment, and divide communities along religious lines.\\n\\nCJP\\'s complaint, while condemning the hate speech, also referenced a recent FIR filed in Thane against another individual, Kajal Hindustani, for delivering a similar hate speech.\\n\\nKey Allegations in the Speech\\n\\nThe complaint provides an in-depth analysis of Chavhanke\\'s speech, citing several excerpts that they argued violated the legal framework meant to ensure a fair and peaceful election process. The speech, according to the complaint, sought to create a sense of insecurity among Hindus by presenting Muslims as a demographic threat, manipulating fears about rising Muslim populations, and linking this to supposed threats like \"Love Jihad\" and \"Land Jihad.\"\\n\\nOne of the most controversial claims made by Chavhanke was the assertion that India faced a crisis of \"infiltrators,\" with an estimated 10 crore illegal Muslim immigrants in the country. He further suggested that the growing Muslim population would soon make Hindus a minority in several states by 2048. His remarks regarding Muslims being an \"economic burden\" on the nation and his demand for their expulsion were, according to the CJP, an incitement to religious hatred.\\n\\nChavhnake said in his speech that, \"There are 10 crore intruders sitting in India. 1 crore in Maharashtra. 40 lakhs in Mumbai. 3.5 lakhs in your district. Infiltrators, those who came into the country without permission. Illegal citizens. Get this illegal citizen out now. Is it legal to say so or not? Is it morally right or not? Practical or not? Because all this money is a burden on this country from an economic point of view. It is also from a cultural point of view. From a social point of view, India is also burdened by this. Crime is also on very High Scale. And the biggest magic is that they are not a citizen of our country. So, can they stay here? But whoever says to take out those citizens is a patriot. I ask the Muslims of India like this, let\\'s start from Karad, how many Muslims in Karad, I appeal from here to Shahar Kazi, and the Shahar Maulana today, will you support us to evict the Indian infiltrators the city of Karad?\" as per CJP\\'s complaint.\\n\\nThe video can be accessed through this link: https:\\n\\nhttps://t.me/hindutvawatchin/669\\n\\nThe MCC is a set of guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India to ensure that elections are conducted in a free, fair, and transparent manner. It prohibits candidates, political parties, and other participants from using communal language or promoting division among the public. Chavhanke\\'s speech, as per the CJP\\'s complaint, clearly violated several provisions of the MCC by inciting communal hatred and promoting a divisive narrative.\\n\\nIn addition, the complaint also pointed out that Chavhanke\\'s actions violated the Representation of People\\'s Act (RPA) of 1951, specifically Section 123(3A), which prohibits any attempts to create or promote enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion, race, caste, or language to influence electoral outcomes. The CJP\\'s complaint argued that Chavhanke\\'s speech was an attempt to manipulate voters by appealing to religious sentiments, thereby undermining the democratic process.\\n\\nThe CJP also raised concerns regarding the safety of the Muslim community in Maharashtra, pointing out that such hate speech contributes to a growing atmosphere of intolerance and hostility, which can lead to real-world violence. The complaint urged the Election Commission and law enforcement authorities to take swift action against Chavhanke and other individuals who engage in similar hate speech, particularly during the election period.\\n\\nMtra Elections: On CJP\\'s complaint on an MCC violation FIR has been registered against Kajal Hindustani for hate speech\\n\\nCJP Highlights MCC Violation: urges Maharashtra Election Commission to act on Hate Speech'}, {'topic': 'Religion Healing', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech in religious communities', 'title': \"Experts of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination Welcome Greece's Guide on Reporting Hate Crimes, Ask about Alleged Violations of the Rights of Minorities and Asylum Seekers - Greece\", 'url': 'https://reliefweb.int/report/greece/experts-committee-elimination-racial-discrimination-welcome-greeces-guide-reporting-hate-crimes-ask-about-alleged-violations-rights-minorities-and-asylum-seekers', 'published_date': '2024-12-04T17:14:47Z', 'source': 'ReliefWeb', 'content': 'The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination today concluded its consideration of the combined twenty-third and twenty-fourth periodic report of Greece.

Were victims of hate crimes made aware of this guide?\\n\\nBakri Sidiki Diaby, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said there had been several allegations of excessive use of force against minorities by the police. How was the State party ensuring that all allegations were properly investigated, perpetrators punished, and victims granted reparations?\\n\\nMr. Diaby said that since March 2020, a significant deterioration had been noted in the security of persons from third countries seeking asylum in the east of Greece. There had been reports of summary forced return, secret detention, confiscation of personal effects, and intrusive searches. What steps had been taken to investigate these alleged violations of human rights and to prevent such violations?\\n\\nIntroducing the report, Aikaterini Patsogianni, Secretary General of Equality and Human Rights, Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family Affairs of Greece and head of the delegation, said that, in the fight against racism, police authorities had developed standards and guidance in areas such as training and capacity building of law enforcement, improved recording and collection of data on hate crimes, as well as cooperation between law enforcement and civil society organizations, and ways to address underreporting.\\n\\nThe delegation said one key initiative of the national action plan against racism and intolerance was the guide for victims on reporting hate crimes, which had been translated into nine languages and published online.

Over 1,000 cases of police misdemeanours had been conveyed to the Ombudsman, and around 660 disciplinary sanctions had been implemented.\\n\\nThe delegation said the Hellenic Coast Guard\\'s practices followed international law. Protecting human life at sea and aiding those in distress, without any form of discrimination, was the highest duty of the Coast Guard. All allegations of pushbacks were appropriately investigated by monitoring bodies. The Coast Guard had saved and continued to save thousands of lives at sea. From 2013, Coast Guard officers had been trained in basic human rights principles.\\n\\nIn concluding remarks, Mr. Diaby thanked the delegation for the dialogue, which had been intensive, fruitful, frank and necessary. The questions raised by the Committee aimed to assess progress in the implementation of the Convention to help the Committee to develop recommendations that were helpful to Greece.\\n\\nIn his concluding remarks, Ioannis Ghikas, Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said the dialogue had been intense but constructive, identifying issues that the State party needed to address. The State was proud of the progress it had made since the last review, including in protecting the rights of asylum seekers and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons.\\n\\nThe delegation of Greece consisted of representatives of the Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family Affairs; Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Ministry of Interior; Ministry of Education, Religious Affairs and Sports; Ministry of Health; Ministry of Citizen Protection; Ministry of Labour and Social Security; Ministry of Justice; Ministry of Migration and Asylum; Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Insular Policy; Hellenic Labour Inspectorate; Presidency of the Government; and the Permanent Mission of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva.\\n\\nThe Committee will issue its concluding observations on the report of Greece after the conclusion of its one hundred and fourteenthOpens in new window session on 13 December.

The State party had taken significant initiatives to combat racial discrimination, including by implementing the national action plan on preventing racism and intolerance, laws combatting hate speech, and training programmes for law enforcement officials. The State party had also adopted a national action plan on preventing anti-Semitism and had made efforts to promote the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, including by implementing legislation on same-sex marriage.\\n\\nProgress had been made despite the decade-long economic crisis that Greece had been facing. The racist \"Golden Dawn\" organization had been banned from participating in political activities and its leaders had been imprisoned. Civil society continued to support the State party\\'s efforts to prevent racism and intolerance. There was much work to be done, but Greece was committed to addressing the issues it faced, and looked forward to the recommendations of the Committee.\\n\\nAIKATERINI PATSOGIANNI, Secretary General of Equality and Human Rights, Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family Affairs of Greece and head of the delegation, said that since the last review, Greece had been advancing toward long-term sustainable economic progress, supporting its human rights and anti-racism framework. In the fight against racism, police authorities had developed standards and guidance in areas such as training and capacity building of law enforcement, improved recording and collection of data on hate crimes, as well as cooperation between law enforcement and civil society organizations, and ways to address underreporting. The judicial system responded to organizations that exploited the economic crisis and the resulting fractures to the social fabric to commit criminal racist acts, while the legislature took measures to protect and safeguard the democratic electoral process from such criminal organizations.\\n\\nThe National Council against Racism and Intolerance, in which independent bodies also participated, adopted its first national action plan in December 2020. Efforts for the second action plan were underway, with funding secured for a results-driven agenda. In this regard, the State party was ready to work with relevant stakeholders, including the Racist Violence Recording Network.\\n\\nGreece was actively implementing the National Strategy on the Roma 2021-2030, guided by the principle of \"for the Roma, with the Roma.\" Key committees, including the independent Roma Forum, were fully operational. All available European Union funding was used to enhance the Roma\\'s employment, education, healthcare and housing.\\n\\nOn migration, modernised reception facilities ensured dignified conditions and targeted care for vulnerable groups, while a robust system supported unaccompanied minors. The Asylum Service had significantly improved in efficiency. The \"HELIOS\" project and legal reforms promoted integration and labour market access. Enhanced international cooperation also provided pathways for organised, legal migration.\\n\\nBorder protection was carried out in line with domestic, European and international law. Protecting human life at sea and aiding those in distress, without any form of discrimination, was the highest duty of the Hellenic Coast Guard. Allegations of violations of the principle of non-refoulement were inconsistent with the operational activities of the competent agencies. The State had put in place a multi-level policy for the effective monitoring of fundamental rights. The Hellenic Coast Guard had saved and continued to save thousands of lives at sea.\\n\\nGreece had ratified International Labour Organization Convention 190 to create a work environment free from violence and harassment. Public authorities detected and protected all trafficking victims, without discrimination, in line with the principles of the Office of the National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings and the National Referral Mechanism.\\n\\nInclusive education was promoted through various initiatives and teacher training programmes. Key efforts included the \"Active Citizens\\' Actions\" curriculum supporting the Sustainable Development Goals, a 2023 anti-bullying law with a reporting platform, a mobile phone ban to reduce cyberbullying, and the introduction of \"Digital School\" and \"Skills Lab\" to enhance digital learning.\\n\\nThe State party had also established an independent Committee of Deontology, aimed at countering all types of expression in printed and electronic media that incited, promoted, spread or justified violence, hatred or discriminatory speech. Human rights education, training and awareness-raising activities, including for law enforcement personnel and members of the judiciary, remained top priorities.\\n\\nQuestions by a Committee Expert\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, thanked Greece for supporting the candidacy of Greek Expert Stamatia Stavrinaki to the Committee, who made remarkable contributions to its work.\\n\\nCould the delegation provide information on the ethnic makeup of the population and of asylum seekers and refugees living in the State party? The Committee was concerned by the general lack of disaggregated data on racial discrimination. What measures were in place to implement a comprehensive data collection system?\\n\\nWhat measures had the State party taken to address excessive use of force by the police? There had been several allegations of such excessive use of force against minorities. How was the State party ensuring that all allegations were properly investigated, perpetrators punished, and victims granted reparations?\\n\\nThere was a limited number of convictions for cases involving racial discrimination and official data on cases reported to the police was not accessible to the public. The Committee was concerned that the new anti-racist law was not fully in line with the requirements of article four of the Convention as it did not criminalise the dissemination of ideas of racial superiority or prohibit racist organizations. What measures were in place to revise legislation to ensure that all incitement to racial, ethnic and religious hatred was criminalised and that perpetrators were punished? How had the police\\'s capacity to investigate racist crimes and to combat racist violence been increased? State services reportedly did not provide appropriate, timely support to victims of racist violence, who relied on support from civil society. Was a referral system for victims to State services being developed?\\n\\nOver the reporting period, there had been 89 reported cases of racism targeting asylum seekers and refugees. The Committee welcomed the various legislative measures undertaken to address racism. Were there gaps in the implementation of legislation on racism? Was there a media regulatory body that held journalists to account when they disseminated racist notions?\\n\\nWas the State party drafting a new national action plan to combat racism and intolerance? What results had the last action plan achieved? The National Council against Racism and Intolerance had been reactivated in 2024. What measures were in place to ensure that the Council could work effectively?\\n\\nWhy had there been delays in the registration of civil society organizations claiming to have minority status? Some minority associations had been dissolved; could the delegation comment on this?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece did not collect statistical data based on race and religious affiliations due to its protection of the right to privacy. Statistical data was collected on specific categories of beneficiaries of State policies, such as policies for the Roma. Data was also collected on the demographics of prison inmates, and on migrants, asylum seekers and refugees according to European Union regulations. A unified information system for reception and asylum was being developed. Data on migrants\\' gender, ethnicity and religion was collected.\\n\\nAfter 2015, there was an amendment to legislation concerning the punishment of hate crimes that facilitated the investigation and prosecution of cases by eliminating the need to prove the standard of \"hate\". Data from the judiciary and the Public Prosecutor showed that there had been better implementation of hate crime legislation in recent years. The State party also had legislation on hate speech and incitement to hatred that addressed speech inciting racial superiority.\\n\\n\"Golden Dawn\" was not allowed to participate in elections and State funding to it had been suspended. All political parties that acted as proxies for persons who had committed racist hate crimes were prohibited, and on this basis two political parties had recently been banned from participating in elections.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said human rights defenders were sometimes accused and condemned without having the opportunity to defend themselves. Did the State party intend to adopt special legislation to protect human rights defenders? Several dozens of cases of refoulement involving Greece had been examined by the European Court of Human Rights. Were border police trained on the handling of migrants? What aid had been provided to victims of police violence?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said that although the European Union directive on victim support had been incorporated into national legislation, there were allegations that the directive was not sufficiently applied, leading to impunity for perpetrators of racist acts. How did the State party collect data on foreign nationals in the prison system? What recommendations had been provided by the Racist Violence Reporting Network to the State and had these been implemented?\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert asked about the effectiveness of State policies. How many of the cases of police misconduct reported had resulted in sanctions? How many committees reviewing journalistic ethics had members of racial minority groups?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece had permitted the reopening of domestic court proceedings after decisions on three cases by the European Court of Human Rights. A committee of independent experts had been established to develop strategies for the implementation of the European Court\\'s decisions.\\n\\nPolice personnel were obliged to respect human rights and perform their duties based on respect for individuals. They needed to avoid prejudice based on distinguishing characteristics. The Hellenic Police transmitted relevant information to an independent Ombudsman concerning cases involving discrimination. Over 1,000 cases of police misdemeanours had been conveyed to the Ombudsman, and around 660 disciplinary sanctions had been implemented. Several cases related to racist actions by the police.\\n\\nThe law on audiovisual media services prohibited the dissemination of hate speech based on race and other characteristics. The National Media Advisory Authority had the competence to impose sanctions for disseminating hate speech through online and offline media. All print and online media needed to meet requirements related to the Journalistic Code of Ethics, which included prohibitions of hate speech. The Journalistic Ethics Committee was mandated to investigate all allegations of discriminatory speech. Its members were not appointed based on their ethnicity or sex but were journalists and academics.\\n\\nIn Greece, persons with low income could apply for free legal aid. Legal aid was also provided to victims in trafficking cases and to female victims of violence. Measures were in place to protect victims from secondary victimisation in legal proceedings. All victims were informed of their rights, including the right to compensation.\\n\\nThe Greek legislative framework did not have a specific law for the protection of human rights defenders; all persons were equal before the law.\\n\\nPrivate funding of political parties was strictly forbidden in Greece. Only State funding was legal for political parties. This was why State funding had been suspended for parties that engaged in hate crimes and hate speech.\\n\\nQuestions by a Committee Expert\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said not all incidents of racism were reported by victims, allegedly due to a lack of confidence in the authorities. What measures were in place to strengthen confidence in the justice system among citizens? Did the State party intend to establish an efficient data collection system on racist violence? How would it promote access to justice for victims of racial discrimination? How many complaints of racist hate speech and hate crimes had been received by the State and how many perpetrators had been prosecuted? In how many court cases had the Convention been cited? What measures had the State party taken to encourage the participation of civil society in the implementation of the Convention? Racism continued to be prevalent in the Attica region and in centres where refugees and asylum seekers were located. Did the State party intend to accept the Committee\\'s communications procedure?\\n\\nDiscrimination against minorities by authorities persisted. What recent educational initiatives had been implemented to combat intolerance and prejudice and promote intercultural dialogue? The State party had received the Global Education Award for establishing the Skills Lab, which promoted ethnic tolerance. Was this implemented in all regions of the State party and at all levels?\\n\\nThe Committee commended the State party for its efforts to create memorials of the Holocaust. There were 158 attacks based on religion recorded in 2023. What measures were in place to ensure efficient investigations of these incidents and to develop protection measures? There had also been an increase in cases of vandalism of religious sites and profanation in recent years. What measures were in place to put an end to these practices?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the police code of conduct required police to act with empathy toward vulnerable people. The State party collected data on hate speech and hate crimes, including data on racially motivated crimes.\\n\\nIn Greek prisons, data was collected on nationality. Foreigners from 101 nationalities made up 50 per cent of the prison population. These were persons who were convicted and serving these sentences in Greek prisons. Greece was on the crossroads of many routes, and many people in prisons in Greece were engaged in cross-border criminal activity.\\n\\nThe Ombudsperson received discrimination complaints. Racial discrimination complaints made up seven per cent of complaints received in 2023, up from two per cent in 2022. The labour inspectorate examined complaints of workplace discrimination. The inspectorate was empowered to instigate administrative sanctions. Three cases it investigated in 2023 involved discrimination on the grounds of nationality.\\n\\nThe police had established specialised departments to address violent hate crimes and hate speech and provide support to victims in Attica and the Eastern Aegean region. A hotline and online form for reporting hate crimes had been implemented, and several campaigns were underway on online hate speech. The police force was cooperating with civil society, which provided training to upgrade the capacities of police staff.\\n\\nThe Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure had been revised to make them more victim centred. Courts had been redistributed to improve citizens\\' access across the State. Domestic violence legislation had also been modernised.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, asked for statistics on victims of discrimination who had benefitted from free legal aid. There was a large gap between the records of racist violence of the Racist Violence Reporting NetworkOpens in new window and the Government. Why was this? On what basis was the second national action plan on addressing racism being devised?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said that it was quite shocking that 50 per cent of prisoners in Greece were non-nationals.\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert said that the State\\'s regulations on the provision of legal aid appeared to limit access to it. Would it consider implementing a system of reviewing all requests for legal aid, regardless of the type of crime?\\n\\nA Committee Expert asked whether the labour inspectorate assigned fines for workplace discrimination. Why were non-nationals in Attica most impacted by racist crimes? How did the State party apply the recommendations of the Racist Violence Reporting Network? The Expert welcomed the guide on reporting hate crimes. Were victims made aware of this guide?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the national action plan against racism and intolerance focused on addressing hate crimes, empowering minorities, and eliminating discrimination based on various characteristics. One key initiative was the guide for victims on reporting hate crimes, which had been translated into nine languages and distributed to migrant reception centres and published online. Several training activities had been held to improve State authorities\\' response to hate crimes.\\n\\nThe National Council against Racism and Intolerance had held meetings with civil society to develop the second national action plan on addressing racism and intolerance. It had secured funding to improve victims\\' access to State services. The Council would review the Committee\\'s recommendations and include them in the second national action plan, which would focus on strengthening data collection on hate crimes and developing more services for victims.\\n\\nThe Skills Lab initiative had been piloted nationwide. New curricula promoted human rights education and intercultural communication. Training courses were offered for teachers on human rights and inclusion. A digital platform for reporting school bullying and violence had been launched. As of April 2024, over 700 reports had been received, 10 per cent of which related to racism.\\n\\nVarious actions had been taken to provide education about the Holocaust. Greece was one of the first countries to return the property of victims of the Holocaust. The State collected data on vandalism of religious sites. In 2015, 147 cases were recorded.\\n\\nThe procedure for applying for free legal aid was very simple. Applicants needed only to supply documents proving that they had low income. Victims of almost all crimes could apply for this aid. Lawyers could be appointed for defendants in serious crimes with punishments of five years imprisonment or more.\\n\\nOn some occasions, victims of racist violence went to the Racist Violence Reporting Network but not to public authorities. In 2023, 115 cases had been opened by authorities. There was not a big gap between the number of cases collected by authorities and by the Network. More than half of the population lived in Attica. This was why most racist crimes were reported in this region.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said 18 per cent of asylum camp residents did not enjoy basic material conditions, including food and financial assistance. There were only 29 doctors, 92 nurses and 69 interpreters deployed across all the camps, some of which had more than 1,000 residents. What measures were in place to improve the situation in the camps and ensure that the detention of foreign nationals was only done as a last resort? How was the State party ensuring access to interpretation services for foreign nationals? What efforts had been made to develop a statelessness establishment procedure? How was the State party addressing barriers to refugees accessing official documents?\\n\\nWhat steps had been taken to investigate alleged violations of human rights in the context of border management and to prevent such violations? Was there regular independent surveillance of border forces and efforts to strengthen their capacity? Since March 2020, a significant deterioration had been noted in the security and safety of persons from third countries seeking asylum in the east of Greece. There had been reports of summary forced return of persons who had entered from Türkiye, secret detention without sufficient safeguards, confiscation of personal effects, and intrusive searches. There were also reports of private individuals towing and removing engines from asylum seekers\\' boats, and assisting officials in carrying out forced returns.\\n\\nGreece had not signed the statelessness convention and the Presidential decree on the statelessness determination procedure had not been promulgated. Around 3,740 people in Greece had stated that they had no nationality. What measures would the State party take to better address the issue of statelessness?\\n\\nThe Committee had previously expressed concern regarding low salaries and long working hours for migrant workers, particularly in the agricultural sector. What measures were in place to improve the situation of migrant workers? Was there a safe and accessible way of filing complaints related to workplace discrimination? What measures were in place to support undocumented migrants and protect them from trafficking and forced labour?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said seminars on human rights and diversity had been provided for over 1,600 public servants. Seminars had been held on the Holocaust for members of the Orthodox Church of Greece and on the basic principles of Islam for prison officers. Over 160 integrity advisors had also been trained and certified to support integrity in the public service. The national school of the judiciary provided mandatory training on human rights, gender-based violence and other topics. In 2024, 15 seminars had been planned for judges and 12 for court staff.\\n\\nGreece directly implemented the Convention in domestic law, which was why court decisions did not directly reference the Convention.\\n\\nIf infringements of labour laws were found, labour inspectors could impose administrative sanctions and fines, and file serious cases of non-compliance with the Prosecutor.\\n\\nRefugee children could enrol in reception classes without documentation. Language classes were offered for students after school hours. Educational guides assisted teachers in making refugee students feel welcome and safe.\\n\\nGreece was facing challenges with the arrival of third country nationals seeking to enter Europe through Türkiye. It had accelerated asylum procedures through the digitisation of asylum procedures. Health care insurance and tax identification numbers were provided to asylum seekers, who could access employment and healthcare throughout the State.\\n\\nOne of the main priorities of Greece\\'s migration policy was to improve asylum conditions. Case managers carried out rapid assessments of new arrivals\\' needs. Vulnerable persons were provided with specialised protection. More interpreters were being provided in collaboration with various public and private organizations and civil society. The \"HELIOS\" integration system offered support to refugees to access the labour market, health and education. Another initiative was specifically focused on providing language, vocational and intercultural training to refugees seeking to enter the job market.\\n\\nMigration legislation had been amended to reduce the number of migrants in informal employment. An agreement had been reached with Egypt on the provision of temporary employment to Egyptian citizens in the agricultural sector. An agreement was also reached with Bangladeshi citizens to improve access to formal employment. These agreements reenforced legal pathways to migration.\\n\\nThe average time taken to process asylum applications was now 100 days; formerly processing took years. Greece collaborated with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to develop a new system of naturalisation that was fairer for refugees and stateless persons. Around 55 applications for Greek citizenship had been received; only 16 were still pending, citizenship had been granted for the rest.\\n\\nPolice had circulated guidelines on the protection of the fundamental rights of refugees arriving in the State. No third country national was to be returned until their asylum application had been processed.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said violence and excessive use of force had been reported in asylum centres. Could the delegation comment on this? Mr. Diaby congratulated the State party on efforts to formalise the status of stateless persons. Did the State party intend to ratify the statelessness convention? How was the State party responding to racist incidents in sport?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert asked about the results of the human rights education strategies implemented by the State.\\n\\nFAITH DIKELEDI PANSY TLAKULA, Committee Expert and Follow-Up Rapporteur, said the Committee had previously recommended that the State party provide training to teachers on providing education to migrant children, ensure individual assessment of asylum applications, and protect against refoulement. What efforts had been made to improve migrants\\' access to asylum procedures and education?\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert said that in recent years, there had been a rise in hate speech across the world, including in Greece. What measures were in place to tackle racist hate speech targeting migrants and minorities, and xenophobia?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the State was proud of improvements that had been made in the situation on the State\\'s islands. The Hellenic Coast Guard\\'s practices followed international law. All allegations of pushbacks were appropriately investigated by monitoring bodies. From 2015 to the present, the Coast Guard had rescued over 250,000 persons at sea. From 2013, Coast Guard officers had been trained in basic human rights principles.\\n\\nGreece was stepping up efforts to prevent trafficking in persons through legal and policy instruments. The national action plan on trafficking in persons was being updated to address financial and labour exploitation. The State party had organised seminars and created standards on the financial aspects of these crimes. New forms of exploitation had been added to legislation. Accommodation, medical care and legal counselling were provided to victims of trafficking in persons. A leaflet on human trafficking had been produced in several languages.\\n\\nThe State party was prioritising the ratification of International Labour Organization convention 29 on forced labour. This process was expected to be completed soon. A plan for the prevention of labour exploitation was formulated by the State each year and preventative inspections were carried out twice a year in vulnerable sectors. Employees could file complaints through an online anonymous complaints service, by email or a telephone hotline. The State provided migrant workers with information about their rights.\\n\\nA programme was in place to increase access to medical staff in asylum centres through measures such as the temporary transfer of medical personnel. Around 16,200 refugee students from 70 different countries were enrolled in Greek educational institutions. Case managers trained in the best interests of the child monitored age assessment procedures, which would soon be harmonised across all European Union Member States.\\n\\nGreece had ratified the regional conventions on safety in sport matches and had implemented legislation that prohibited banners at sporting matches with racist or sexist content.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said Greece only formally recognised one minority, Thrace Muslims. Why were other minority groups not recognised as minorities? What data was collected on minorities? How well represented was the Muslim minority in public bodies and in elected roles at national and local levels?\\n\\nWhat outcomes had been achieved by the last national strategy on the inclusion of the Roma and what progress had been made in implementing the current strategy? Were the Roma consulted about policies and strategies that affected them? Roma people reportedly continued to be victims of discrimination in Greece when trying to access healthcare, housing and employment. Many Roma people lived below the poverty threshold and struggled to access basic services. What measures were in place to ensure equal access for Roma children to education and schooling? What measures were in place to improve access to paid employment and quality healthcare for the Roma? Roma often lacked access to heating, running water and toilets. How was the State party preventing forced evictions and fines for illegal construction? Roma people faced long, costly judicial procedures to acquire Greek nationality. How was the State party promoting their access to nationality?\\n\\nThe Committee noted the adoption of several laws and the national strategy in favour of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. However, this community continued to be subjected to discrimination in schools and public services. What measures were in place to tackle such discrimination? What results had the national strategy achieved?\\n\\nThere were reports of migrant women, including pregnant women, having been assaulted by Greek Coast Guards. Greece had the highest rate of femicide in Europe. What measures were in place to address violence against women?\\n\\nWhat statistics did the State party have on people of African descent and their integration in public life? What activities had been undertaken as part of the International Decade for People of African Descent? How was the State party combatting the multiple forms of discrimination faced by this group? What measures were in place to implement the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action? Was there a formal mechanism in place to assess its implementation?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the term \"minority\" in Greece was understood under stricter criteria than those of the Committee. The State party respected the principle of self-identification. Groups of people who were not recognised as a minority enjoyed all rights under the Convention. Four members of the Hellenic Parliament were Muslims, and more than 100 Muslims had been elected to public bodies.\\n\\nThe Roma had expressed the will not to be considered as an ethnic minority. Authorities paid particular attention to this vulnerable group. The State had made the civil registry process easier and more efficient for the Roma. The previous strategy on Roma inclusion provided specific interventions to address early school dropouts and support access to health and housing. Implementation of this strategy was independently reviewed. There were also 85 local action plans on Roma support elaborated with the Roma population. There was an open, independent consultation platform with 13 Roma organizations that met every three months to devise strategies for Roma inclusion.\\n\\nRoma people were eligible for all State welfare benefits. The State party was promoting the Roma\\'s participation in education and the labour market. The public employment service implemented targeted programmes for the Roma, such as 15,000-euro subsidies for Roma who started a business and training and certification in technical jobs.\\n\\nThe Government had taken measures to facilitate the inclusion of Roma children in education. Psychosocial support was provided to vulnerable students in schools. Roma children could be enrolled in schools without official documentation. Teacher training programmes were provided on combatting early school dropouts and supporting Roma children.\\n\\nThe State party did not have records of complaints against Coast Guard officials regarding sexual assault of pregnant women. This year, there had been 12 victims of femicide. The State party had ratified the Istanbul Convention and was collecting data on violence against women and conducting training in schools to raise awareness of the issue. There was a large network of structures for supporting women victims, who had access to emergency accommodation.\\n\\nThe national strategy on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons aimed to combat discrimination and promote equality for these people. All ministries carried out actions supporting these people.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said there were gaps between policies for the Roma and practices. What was the size of the Roma population? What were the causes of femicides in the State party and the ethnic origins of the victims? Had the State party considered making a law on femicide?\\n\\nA Committee Expert said Roma children were being segregated in Greek schools. How many Roma children were participating in and graduating from inclusive public education?\\n\\nFAITH DIKELEDI PANSY TLAKULA, Committee Expert and Follow-Up Rapporteur, said the Committee had previously expressed concern about the poor working conditions of migrant workers in the agricultural sector and the informal economy. What investigations had been carried out into the exploitation of migrant workers and what compensation was provided to victims? Were employers who imposed abusive labour conditions subjected to criminal sanctions? What training was provided to labour inspectors on identifying victims of human trafficking?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said Greece\\'s efforts to preserve its historical monuments were commendable.\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece was home to a vibrant community of people of African descent, many of whom held leading roles in civil society and public organizations. Greece fully supported the pending General Assembly resolution to declare a second International Decade for People of African DescentOpens in new window. The National Council against Racism and Intolerance was implementing measures to support the rights of people of African descent.\\n\\nThere were 120,000 Roma people in Greece, 20,000 of whom received guaranteed minimum income support. To encourage school attendance, families whose children did not attend school did not receive welfare benefits. Investments had been made to improve housing infrastructure in Roma communities.\\n\\nAround 1,600 labour inspections were carried out this year and fines were issued in around 700 cases. Twenty cases had been reported to the Public Prosecutor regarding potential victims of trafficking in persons. Standards had been developed for seasonal housing for migrant workers. The labour inspectorate\\'s staff had been increased recently. All inspectors participated in training on preventing and identifying human trafficking.\\n\\nClosing Remarks\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, thanked the delegation for the dialogue, which had been intensive, fruitful, frank and necessary. The questions raised by the Committee aimed to assess progress in the implementation of the Convention to help the Committee to develop recommendations that were helpful to Greece.\\n\\nIOANNIS GHIKAS, Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said the dialogue had been intense but constructive, identifying issues that the State party needed to address. Greece was proud of the Greek Committee Expert Stamatia Stavrinaki, who was an excellent representative of the tradition of human rights scholarship in Greece. The strong representation of women in the delegation was a representation of the reality in Greece, where promoting women\\'s representation was a high priority. The State was proud of the progress it had made since the last review, including in protecting the rights of asylum seekers and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons.'}, {'topic': 'Religion Healing', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech in religious communities', 'title': \"At a UN forum in Portugal, Pakistan calls for 'action plan' to combat Islamophobia\", 'url': 'https://www.app.com.pk/global/at-a-un-forum-in-portugal-pakistan-calls-for-action-plan-to-combat-islamophobia/', 'published_date': '2024-12-04T07:01:14Z', 'source': 'Associated Press Of Pakistan', 'content': 'UNITED NATIONS, Dec 04 (APP): Amid a rising tide of anti-Muslim hate, Pakistan has renewed its call for an \"action plan\" to tackle\\n\\nthe pressing issue of Islamophobia.\\n\\nSpeaking at a side-event of the 10th Global Forum of the U.N. Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC) recently held in Cascais, Portugal, Additional Foreign Secretary, Imran Ahmed Siddiqui, reaffirmed Pakistan\\'s \"unwavering commitment\" to combating this scourage, according to a press release issued in NewYork on Tuesday.\\n\\nAt the same time, he reiterated Pakistan\\'s deep concern over the continued rise of Islamophobia, as manifested in the continued desecration of religious symbols, demolition of mosques and other Islamic religious and heritage sites, hate speech and disturbing attacks on Muslims, \"particularly in the territories under foreign occupation\".\\n\\nThe UN Alliance of Civilizations was established in 2005 to galvanize international action against extremism through fostering of international, intercultural and interreligious dialogue and cooperation.\\n\\nThe Alliance benefits from a political support of the Group of Friends, a community of countries and international organizations which actively promotes its objectives and work at the global, regional and local levels, as well as worldwide. The Group is a driving force of UNAOC and plays a vital role in its strategic planning and implementation process.\\n\\nThe group currently includes 153 members, with 124 UN member states, 1 non-member state, and 28 international organizations, representing all continents, societies and cultures.\\n\\nIn his remarks, Imran Siddiqui said commended the Alliance\\'s contributions over the past two decades in fostering dialogue and mutual respect among religions.\\n\\nAs regards Islamophobia, he cited Pakistan\\'s leadership in tabling two General Assembly resolutions on behalf of the OIC on the subject, with the most recent resolution, adopted in March 2024, calling for the appointment of a UN Special Envoy on Islamophobia.\\n\\nA Global Conference on safeguarding religious sites was also held on the margins of the Forum, where Pakistan highlighted the alarming trend of deliberate attacks on mosques, often carried out with impunity and state sanction, the press release said. In this regard, Pakistan urged the UNAOC to prioritize the protection of mosques and other Islamic religious and heritage sites that are at immediate risk of destruction in the mapping of religious sites under the 2019 Action Plan for safeguarding of the religious site.\\n\\nMeanwhile, world leaders attending the forum adopted a bold, forward-looking declaration to advance peace as war rages on, from Gaza and Lebanon to Sudan and Ukraine.\\n\\nHarnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and combatting hate speech and mis- and disinformation are part of the plan to bolster peace and mutual understanding as Heads of State and Government, including kings, presidents and prime ministers from Cabo Verde, Senegal and Spain, unanimously adopted the Cascais Declaration.\\n\\nNamed for the city hosting the UN Alliance for Civilizations 10th Global Forum from 25 to 27 November, the declaration outlines a range of actions and focuses on solutions to a current landscape of eroding trust and rising antisemitism, nationalism and online hate.\\n\\n\"These are very difficult times,\" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the forum\\'s opening session. \"In such a scenario, we need peace\" now, in Gaza, Lebanon, Sudan and Ukraine and beyond.\\n\\nThe adoption of the declaration is the centre-piece of the 10th Global Forum, which included a dynamic youth forum and film festival on Monday, its Intercultural Innovation Hub ceremony on Tuesday and vibrant panels throughout, tackling current challenges, from a spike in antisemitism to the power of young people.\\n\\n\"We need voices and actions across all levels,\" including in communities, online and across cultures and institutions, using all tools available, Guterres said.\\n\\nThe 25-paragraph declaration spotlighted a set of innovative actions and keys to unleashing this badly needed peace. It noted the potential use of AI as a tool to advance intercultural and inter-religious dialogue and stressed the importance of combatting disinformation, misinformation and hate speech while strengthening information integrity.\\n\\nThe Cascais Declaration also stressed the importance of intergenerational dialogue for peace, sustainable development and human rights; noted the contribution of \"sports diplomacy\" as a tool for promoting dialogue and emphasized the need to support and strengthen the role of women as negotiators, mediators and peacemakers.\\n\\nBy its provisions, world leaders and partners pledged to:\\n\\n-- Emphasise the need to combat all forms of religious intolerance;\\n\\n-- Acknowledge the central role of inclusive, quality and transformative education in promoting dialogue, peace and human rights;\\n\\n-- Recognise the role that religious leaders can play in conflict mediation and development cooperation;\\n\\n-- Underline the positive impact that safe, orderly and regular migration can have on countries of origin and destination, including through promoting cultural pluralism and encourage the creative vision of young people to prevent xenophobia and highlight positive narratives about cultural diversity, social inclusion and mobility, and,\\n\\n-- Take note of the adoption of the Pact for the Future, which recognizes the role of reinvigorated multilateralism and the importance of the voice of religious leaders and faith-based organizations in promoting a culture of peace\\n\\nAhead of the declaration\\'s adoption, the UN chief and world leaders took the floor, including Prime Minister Aminata Touré of Senegal, who drew attention to the ongoing devastating war in Gaza.\\n\\n\"As we witness what is happening in Gaza, with more than 42,000 victims, mostly civilians, what does civilization mean in such context?\" she asked. \"Is civilization about \\'you kill one of mine, I\\'ll kill 34.16 of yours,\\' which is, so far, the retaliation rate of Israel against the unacceptable, widely condemned attacks of October 2023. Don\\'t the unbearable scenes we see on television make any discussion on civilization look out of touch?\"\\n\\nShe said there is no other way to deal with civilization than discussion based on equal rights embedded in the UN Charter and international framework.\\n\\nKing Don Felipe VI of Spain told delegates that \"in the 21st century, diplomacy is a tool of peace, but its traditional tools are outdated and must be supplemented with new spheres of action, more boldness, creativity and pragmatism.\"\\n\\n\"We must raise our vision to more deeply understand what unites us,\" King Don Felipe VI said. \"The Alliance of Civilizations is the implementation of what is known as the diplomacy of values, tearing down walls and building bridges,\" he added. \"Our actions must go beyond conference rooms, to school, places where people gather and the marketplace.\"\\n\\nIn this regard, he said, social media is potential as a catalyst in this regard, he said, pointing to the Alliance\\'s Youth Solidarity Fund, which was featured on day one of the 10th Global Forum.\\n\\nStill, a great deal more needs to be done, he said. At a time when dehumanisation is a growing problem, he emphasised that efforts must aim at eliminating stereotypes and ensuring that the wealth of human diversity is beneficial for everyone.\\n\\nIn a similar vein, UN Secretary-General Guterres said that the absence of peace is leading to an erosion of trust, making the Alliance of Civilizations\\'s work more important than ever before.\\n\\n\"Rebuilding trust is our essential task,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Hate-filled frenzies are perpetuating stereotypes and misconceptions,\" the UN chief said.

At the conference, Emilie Kao, the group\\'s senior counsel and vice president of advocacy strategy, took the floor to express her outrage that a Finnish doctor was put on trial for referring to homosexuality as \"a developmental disorder,\" \"a shame and a sin\" and as a form of \"genetic degeneration.\"\\n\\n\"Thank God she was unanimously acquitted,\" said Kao.\\n\\nAustin Ruse, president of the Center for Family and Human Rights (otherwise known as C-Fam), who has supported laws that would criminalise homosexual behaviour and has also said that hard left people that run modern universities should be \"taken out and shot,\" spoke about some of his group\\'s recent accomplishments. \"There is no redefinition of the family because we stopped them. Sexual orientation and gender identity has never become a category of nondiscrimination in international law, because we have stopped them,\" he said.\\n\\nKao, C-Fam and ADF did not respond to requests for comment. Ruse disputed that he called for the criminalization of gay sex, saying that he was only offering \"a hypothetical.\" He added that he has \"never advocated that anyone be taken out and shot.\"\\n\\nThe access and influence of these anti-LGBTQIA+ groups inside the UN isn\\'t limited to this summit. Both hold what\\'s known as Special Consultative status at the UN. And they\\'re not the only ones.\\n\\nIn a months-long investigation, Uncloseted Media found that at least six Southern Poverty Law Center-designated anti-LGBTQIA+ hate groups hold this coveted status, which is granted by the UN\\'s Economic and Social Council.\\n\\n\"What\\'s astounding is I\\'m not sure anybody\\'s ever produced a list,\" says Heidi Beirich, who oversaw SPLC\\'s annual designation of hate groups from 2012 to 2019. \"These organisations have been stealthily inserting themselves into bodies whose beliefs they don\\'t share for years,\" she says.\\n\\n\"Many of these organisations don\\'t even believe in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\" she says.\\n\\nSpecial Consultative Status -- which is held by more than 5000 groups -- gives members unique access to the UN and its subsidiary bodies, to the various human rights mechanisms of the organisation and to special events organised by the President of the General Assembly.\\n\\nThe UN did not respond to repeated interview requests as well as requests for comment.\\n\\n\"You have access to member states, right? So I think the danger of all of this is access to the members who make decisions on resolutions. Who make UN policy,\" says Gillian Kane, director of global policy and research at Ipas, a non-governmental organisation that focuses on advancing gender equity and reducing the harm of U.S. foreign policy.\\n\\nKane, who attended the November Summit, says this status \"legitimises these groups\" who have clear track records that conflict with the core principles of the UN, like the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing subtle about what they do. They hate gays and they\\'re unapologetic to go after it,\" says Kane.\\n\\nMany of these groups have been around for decades, advocating against the LGBTQIA+ community. Kao\\'s group, ADF, published a press release titled \"ADF increases global impact with new status at United Nations\" when they were granted consultative status in 2010. \"ADF can now have a say when UN treaties and conventions are drafted that directly impact religious liberty and important matters related to the sanctity of life, marriage, and the family,\" the release said. It goes on to say that \"ADF will now be able to monitor and provide input on matters\" affecting religious freedoms.\\n\\nThe group, which consists of hundreds of lawyers in the U.S. and around the globe, was founded in 1994 by Alan Sears, who co-authored The Homosexual Agenda: Exposing the Principal Threat to Religious Freedom Today. Since then, they have advocated at the state and federal level for laws that promote conversion therapy and that would ban gays from serving in the military. In addition, they\\'ve testified in favour of laws that would strip transgender folks of the right to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity, that would prevent them from changing the name on their birth certificate and that would ban their access to gender affirming healthcare.\\n\\nIn addition, they have been effective globally through their international arm, ADF International. In 2012 in Jamaica, they advocated for the retention of a a law that criminalises gay sex. That law remains in effect. And in 2013, members of ADF worked to defend a Belize statute that makes anyone engaging in LGBTQIA+ sex subject to a punishment of up to 10 years in prison.\\n\\nThe other groups -- which include the Howard Center for Family Religion and Society (now known as International Organization for Family), Family Research Council, the Association of United Families International and the American Family Association of New York -- all have similar track records.\\n\\nSubscribe now\\n\\nFamily Research Council has advocated in favor of conversion therapy laws and continues to publish articles that falsely assert that \"sexual orientation change efforts\" are effective for gay people. And Tim Wildmon, the President of the American Family Association, is currently advocating for a boycott of Target for allowing trans people to use the bathroom or dressing room that matches their gender identity.\\n\\n\"Please use #BoycottTarget,\" Wildmon wrote in a special update on their website.\\n\\nBecause of these track records, Beirich felt it was \"a no brainer\" to add them to the SPLC\\'s list of hate groups alongside the Ku Klux Klan, the American Defense Skinheads and Aryan Nations.\\n\\n\"We put them on the hate list because they demonise the entire LGBTQIA+ population in derogatory, dehumanising language, just like the Klan would with Black people or Jewish people,\" says Beirich, now the co-founder and chief strategy officer at the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.\\n\\n\"People in the Christian right who have long demonised the LGBTQIA+ community have political power in this country, and it\\'s more normalised to hate queer people than to hate Black people for no damn good reason. Which is what we\\'re talking about. So it\\'s the biblically informed aspect of it that somehow legitimises it,\" says Beirich, who adds that she has \"absolutely no idea\" how these groups secured this status.\\n\\nSo how do these groups get here? While they all conform to basic principles required for Special Consultative Status, such as being a registered nonprofit and having specialised expertise on issues relevant to the UN, they are also expected to act in conformity with \"the spirit, purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,\" which specifically states that members must promote and encourage respect for human rights, take action \"to strengthen universal peace\" and -- specifically for members with consultative status -- must promote policies that encourage \"social progress.\"\\n\\nNeil Datta, the executive director for the European Parliamentary Forum for Sexual and Reproductive Rights, says part of the reason these groups are granted this status is due to overworked civil servants who work for the NGO Branch of the UN and are in charge of a preliminary screening of these applicants.\\n\\n\"The folks reviewing these applications are not necessarily thematic experts on anything. So they\\'re tasked with a very dry job of processing different applications that come in, and very legitimately won\\'t know what all of these different groups are,\" he says. \"Imagine you had 15 climate groups applying and one didn\\'t believe in climate change. It\\'s not necessarily that easy to understand.\"\\n\\nDatta says it can be even harder to identify anti-LGBTQIA+ groups because they often operate under the guise of protecting the family or the rights of the child.\\n\\n\"These groups have very nice names that aren\\'t obviously anti-LGBTQIA+. And so the people reviewing these applications may not be able to pick up on some of the subtleties,\" he says.\\n\\nIn addition, Datta says these groups use \"very clever vocabulary\" that sounds well meaning. But really, they are weaponising this language to penetrate powerful institutions like the UN \"In reality, they\\'re using religious freedom as a fig leaf for hate speech.\"\\n\\n\"But if you know your Catholic social doctrine, then you will recognise [this vocabulary] immediately.\" Datta says common dog whistles such as \"common good\" or \"human dignity\" and \"in favour of life [or] of the family\" are used almost exclusively to limit the human rights of others, \"usually in sexuality and reproduction.\"\\n\\nDatta says these \"codewords\" are another reason these groups go unnoticed within the UN. For example, during a three hour meeting at the November Transatlantic Summit event, participants used the term \"human dignity\" over 30 times.\\n\\nAfter they get through the preliminary screening by UN civil servants, their application is reviewed by the NGO Committee -- which meets twice a year -- to decide who they will recommend for Special Consultative Status. After review, the recommended organisations are presented to ECOSOC for their final decision.\\n\\nThis committee includes 19 countries, including multiple countries that have extremely hostile policies against LGBTQIA+ people, like Algeria, where homosexual activity is punishable by up to two years in prison; and Eritrea, where homosexuality is illegal and can be punished with jail-time.\\n\\n\"It honestly depends on who\\'s sitting on that committee. So if you have countries that already have anti-LGBTQIA+ policies in place, they\\'re going to be friendly to inviting these groups in and approving their status,\" says Kane.\\n\\nOnce these groups officially gain this status, they use religious freedom as a justification for promoting policies and laws that limit the rights of LGBTQIA+ people through the UN apparatus.\\n\\nThe UN Declaration of Human Rights does not yet explicitly protect folks who are discriminated against for their sexual orientation or gender identity. This lack of protection has given anti-LGBTQIA+ groups leverage in their arguments to roll back the rights of LGBTQIA+ folks.\\n\\nInside the UN, there are efforts to change this. For example, in 2019 the Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect published a Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech that outlines what constitutes hate speech and how to combat it. In it, they describe hate speech \"as any kind of communication in speech, writing or behaviour, that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender or other identity factor.\"\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, this new guidance is opposed by the anti-LGBTQIA+ hate groups. At the Political Network for Values Transatlantic Summit in November, ADF\\'s Kao said current hate speech laws protect too many different groups of people and in doing so infringe on religious freedom laws. \"Who can possibly know what would fall under such an expansive definition of hate?\" she said. \"These laws give a veto to any offended person, allowing them to censor their neighbours.\"\\n\\nBeirich strongly disagrees. \"You can\\'t use religion as a foil for harming communities and tearing into their civil and human rights. I don\\'t care,\" she says, adding that the Ku Klux Klan has weaponised religion as a means to discriminate against Black people since it was founded in 1865.\\n\\n\"It\\'s one thing to live your life however you want to live it biblically inspired. It\\'s a different thing to have that affect other people,\" says Beirich. \"Keep your views to yourself.\"\\n\\nAs these groups continue to operate inside the UN, what can be done? Datta says NGOs applying for Special Consultative Status should be subject to more rigorous background checks, where an independent body thoroughly examines the track record of applicants.\\n\\n\"What are the positions...of these organisations and what have they actually done?\" says Datta. \"What other things have they done which could be seen as having undermined human rights -- the UN\\'s Declaration of Human Rights?\"\\n\\nHe says using an independent body for this review would reduce the potential of political influences in the decision-making process.\\n\\nAs for those who already have Special Consultative Status, their status can be revoked if they don\\'t \"conform at all times to the principles governing the establishment.\"\\n\\nBeirich feels strongly that should happen swiftly for all six anti-LGBTQIA+ groups that currently hold this status. \"The United Nations should revoke the consultative status of people who stand opposed to the Universal Declaration. It shouldn\\'t stand for policies that are rolling back human rights -- it\\'s absurd.\"'}], [{'topic': 'Race Identity', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech and racism', 'title': \"Experts of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination Welcome Greece's Guide on Reporting Hate Crimes, Ask about Alleged Violations of the Rights of Minorities and Asylum Seekers - Greece\", 'url': 'https://reliefweb.int/report/greece/experts-committee-elimination-racial-discrimination-welcome-greeces-guide-reporting-hate-crimes-ask-about-alleged-violations-rights-minorities-and-asylum-seekers', 'published_date': '2024-12-04T17:14:47Z', 'source': 'ReliefWeb', 'content': 'The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination today concluded its consideration of the combined twenty-third and twenty-fourth periodic report of Greece.

Were victims of hate crimes made aware of this guide?\\n\\nBakri Sidiki Diaby, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said there had been several allegations of excessive use of force against minorities by the police. How was the State party ensuring that all allegations were properly investigated, perpetrators punished, and victims granted reparations?\\n\\nMr. Diaby said that since March 2020, a significant deterioration had been noted in the security of persons from third countries seeking asylum in the east of Greece. There had been reports of summary forced return, secret detention, confiscation of personal effects, and intrusive searches. What steps had been taken to investigate these alleged violations of human rights and to prevent such violations?\\n\\nIntroducing the report, Aikaterini Patsogianni, Secretary General of Equality and Human Rights, Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family Affairs of Greece and head of the delegation, said that, in the fight against racism, police authorities had developed standards and guidance in areas such as training and capacity building of law enforcement, improved recording and collection of data on hate crimes, as well as cooperation between law enforcement and civil society organizations, and ways to address underreporting.\\n\\nThe delegation said one key initiative of the national action plan against racism and intolerance was the guide for victims on reporting hate crimes, which had been translated into nine languages and published online. Several training activities had been held to improve State authorities\\' response to hate crimes.\\n\\nPolice personnel were obliged to respect human rights and perform their duties based on respect for individuals, the delegation said. Over 1,000 cases of police misdemeanours had been conveyed to the Ombudsman, and around 660 disciplinary sanctions had been implemented.\\n\\nThe delegation said the Hellenic Coast Guard\\'s practices followed international law. Protecting human life at sea and aiding those in distress, without any form of discrimination, was the highest duty of the Coast Guard. All allegations of pushbacks were appropriately investigated by monitoring bodies. The Coast Guard had saved and continued to save thousands of lives at sea. From 2013, Coast Guard officers had been trained in basic human rights principles.\\n\\nIn concluding remarks, Mr. Diaby thanked the delegation for the dialogue, which had been intensive, fruitful, frank and necessary.

Summaries of the public meetings of the Committee can be found here, while webcasts of the public meetings can be found hereOpens in new window.\\n\\nThe Committee will next meet in public on Wednesday, 4 December at 3 p.m. to consider the combined eighth and ninth periodic report of Kenya (CERD/C/KEN/8-9Opens in new window).\\n\\nReport\\n\\nThe Committee has before it the combined twenty-third and twenty-fourth periodic report of Greece (CERD/C/GRC/23-24Opens in new window).\\n\\nPresentation of Report\\n\\nIOANNIS GHIKAS, Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said the dialogue would highlight the progress Greece had made. The State party had taken significant initiatives to combat racial discrimination, including by implementing the national action plan on preventing racism and intolerance, laws combatting hate speech, and training programmes for law enforcement officials. The State party had also adopted a national action plan on preventing anti-Semitism and had made efforts to promote the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, including by implementing legislation on same-sex marriage.\\n\\nProgress had been made despite the decade-long economic crisis that Greece had been facing. The racist \"Golden Dawn\" organization had been banned from participating in political activities and its leaders had been imprisoned. Civil society continued to support the State party\\'s efforts to prevent racism and intolerance. There was much work to be done, but Greece was committed to addressing the issues it faced, and looked forward to the recommendations of the Committee.\\n\\nAIKATERINI PATSOGIANNI, Secretary General of Equality and Human Rights, Ministry of Social Cohesion and Family Affairs of Greece and head of the delegation, said that since the last review, Greece had been advancing toward long-term sustainable economic progress, supporting its human rights and anti-racism framework. In the fight against racism, police authorities had developed standards and guidance in areas such as training and capacity building of law enforcement, improved recording and collection of data on hate crimes, as well as cooperation between law enforcement and civil society organizations, and ways to address underreporting. The judicial system responded to organizations that exploited the economic crisis and the resulting fractures to the social fabric to commit criminal racist acts, while the legislature took measures to protect and safeguard the democratic electoral process from such criminal organizations.\\n\\nThe National Council against Racism and Intolerance, in which independent bodies also participated, adopted its first national action plan in December 2020. Efforts for the second action plan were underway, with funding secured for a results-driven agenda. In this regard, the State party was ready to work with relevant stakeholders, including the Racist Violence Recording Network.\\n\\nGreece was actively implementing the National Strategy on the Roma 2021-2030, guided by the principle of \"for the Roma, with the Roma.\" Key committees, including the independent Roma Forum, were fully operational. All available European Union funding was used to enhance the Roma\\'s employment, education, healthcare and housing.\\n\\nOn migration, modernised reception facilities ensured dignified conditions and targeted care for vulnerable groups, while a robust system supported unaccompanied minors. The Asylum Service had significantly improved in efficiency. The \"HELIOS\" project and legal reforms promoted integration and labour market access. Enhanced international cooperation also provided pathways for organised, legal migration.\\n\\nBorder protection was carried out in line with domestic, European and international law. Protecting human life at sea and aiding those in distress, without any form of discrimination, was the highest duty of the Hellenic Coast Guard. Allegations of violations of the principle of non-refoulement were inconsistent with the operational activities of the competent agencies. The State had put in place a multi-level policy for the effective monitoring of fundamental rights. The Hellenic Coast Guard had saved and continued to save thousands of lives at sea.\\n\\nGreece had ratified International Labour Organization Convention 190 to create a work environment free from violence and harassment. Public authorities detected and protected all trafficking victims, without discrimination, in line with the principles of the Office of the National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings and the National Referral Mechanism.\\n\\nInclusive education was promoted through various initiatives and teacher training programmes. Key efforts included the \"Active Citizens\\' Actions\" curriculum supporting the Sustainable Development Goals, a 2023 anti-bullying law with a reporting platform, a mobile phone ban to reduce cyberbullying, and the introduction of \"Digital School\" and \"Skills Lab\" to enhance digital learning.\\n\\nThe State party had also established an independent Committee of Deontology, aimed at countering all types of expression in printed and electronic media that incited, promoted, spread or justified violence, hatred or discriminatory speech. Human rights education, training and awareness-raising activities, including for law enforcement personnel and members of the judiciary, remained top priorities.\\n\\nQuestions by a Committee Expert\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, thanked Greece for supporting the candidacy of Greek Expert Stamatia Stavrinaki to the Committee, who made remarkable contributions to its work.\\n\\nCould the delegation provide information on the ethnic makeup of the population and of asylum seekers and refugees living in the State party? The Committee was concerned by the general lack of disaggregated data on racial discrimination. What measures were in place to implement a comprehensive data collection system?\\n\\nWhat measures had the State party taken to address excessive use of force by the police? There had been several allegations of such excessive use of force against minorities. How was the State party ensuring that all allegations were properly investigated, perpetrators punished, and victims granted reparations?\\n\\nThere was a limited number of convictions for cases involving racial discrimination and official data on cases reported to the police was not accessible to the public. The Committee was concerned that the new anti-racist law was not fully in line with the requirements of article four of the Convention as it did not criminalise the dissemination of ideas of racial superiority or prohibit racist organizations. What measures were in place to revise legislation to ensure that all incitement to racial, ethnic and religious hatred was criminalised and that perpetrators were punished? How had the police\\'s capacity to investigate racist crimes and to combat racist violence been increased? State services reportedly did not provide appropriate, timely support to victims of racist violence, who relied on support from civil society. Was a referral system for victims to State services being developed?\\n\\nOver the reporting period, there had been 89 reported cases of racism targeting asylum seekers and refugees. The Committee welcomed the various legislative measures undertaken to address racism. Were there gaps in the implementation of legislation on racism? Was there a media regulatory body that held journalists to account when they disseminated racist notions?\\n\\nWas the State party drafting a new national action plan to combat racism and intolerance? What results had the last action plan achieved? The National Council against Racism and Intolerance had been reactivated in 2024. What measures were in place to ensure that the Council could work effectively?\\n\\nWhy had there been delays in the registration of civil society organizations claiming to have minority status? Some minority associations had been dissolved; could the delegation comment on this?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece did not collect statistical data based on race and religious affiliations due to its protection of the right to privacy. Statistical data was collected on specific categories of beneficiaries of State policies, such as policies for the Roma. Data was also collected on the demographics of prison inmates, and on migrants, asylum seekers and refugees according to European Union regulations. A unified information system for reception and asylum was being developed. Data on migrants\\' gender, ethnicity and religion was collected.\\n\\nAfter 2015, there was an amendment to legislation concerning the punishment of hate crimes that facilitated the investigation and prosecution of cases by eliminating the need to prove the standard of \"hate\". Data from the judiciary and the Public Prosecutor showed that there had been better implementation of hate crime legislation in recent years. The State party also had legislation on hate speech and incitement to hatred that addressed speech inciting racial superiority.\\n\\n\"Golden Dawn\" was not allowed to participate in elections and State funding to it had been suspended. All political parties that acted as proxies for persons who had committed racist hate crimes were prohibited, and on this basis two political parties had recently been banned from participating in elections.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said human rights defenders were sometimes accused and condemned without having the opportunity to defend themselves. Did the State party intend to adopt special legislation to protect human rights defenders? Several dozens of cases of refoulement involving Greece had been examined by the European Court of Human Rights. Were border police trained on the handling of migrants? What aid had been provided to victims of police violence?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said that although the European Union directive on victim support had been incorporated into national legislation, there were allegations that the directive was not sufficiently applied, leading to impunity for perpetrators of racist acts. How did the State party collect data on foreign nationals in the prison system? What recommendations had been provided by the Racist Violence Reporting Network to the State and had these been implemented?\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert asked about the effectiveness of State policies. How many of the cases of police misconduct reported had resulted in sanctions? How many committees reviewing journalistic ethics had members of racial minority groups?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece had permitted the reopening of domestic court proceedings after decisions on three cases by the European Court of Human Rights. A committee of independent experts had been established to develop strategies for the implementation of the European Court\\'s decisions.\\n\\nPolice personnel were obliged to respect human rights and perform their duties based on respect for individuals. They needed to avoid prejudice based on distinguishing characteristics. The Hellenic Police transmitted relevant information to an independent Ombudsman concerning cases involving discrimination. Over 1,000 cases of police misdemeanours had been conveyed to the Ombudsman, and around 660 disciplinary sanctions had been implemented. Several cases related to racist actions by the police.\\n\\nThe law on audiovisual media services prohibited the dissemination of hate speech based on race and other characteristics. The National Media Advisory Authority had the competence to impose sanctions for disseminating hate speech through online and offline media. All print and online media needed to meet requirements related to the Journalistic Code of Ethics, which included prohibitions of hate speech. The Journalistic Ethics Committee was mandated to investigate all allegations of discriminatory speech. Its members were not appointed based on their ethnicity or sex but were journalists and academics.\\n\\nIn Greece, persons with low income could apply for free legal aid. Legal aid was also provided to victims in trafficking cases and to female victims of violence. Measures were in place to protect victims from secondary victimisation in legal proceedings. All victims were informed of their rights, including the right to compensation.\\n\\nThe Greek legislative framework did not have a specific law for the protection of human rights defenders; all persons were equal before the law.\\n\\nPrivate funding of political parties was strictly forbidden in Greece. Only State funding was legal for political parties. This was why State funding had been suspended for parties that engaged in hate crimes and hate speech.\\n\\nQuestions by a Committee Expert\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said not all incidents of racism were reported by victims, allegedly due to a lack of confidence in the authorities. What measures were in place to strengthen confidence in the justice system among citizens? Did the State party intend to establish an efficient data collection system on racist violence? How would it promote access to justice for victims of racial discrimination? How many complaints of racist hate speech and hate crimes had been received by the State and how many perpetrators had been prosecuted? In how many court cases had the Convention been cited? What measures had the State party taken to encourage the participation of civil society in the implementation of the Convention? Racism continued to be prevalent in the Attica region and in centres where refugees and asylum seekers were located. Did the State party intend to accept the Committee\\'s communications procedure?\\n\\nDiscrimination against minorities by authorities persisted. What recent educational initiatives had been implemented to combat intolerance and prejudice and promote intercultural dialogue? The State party had received the Global Education Award for establishing the Skills Lab, which promoted ethnic tolerance. Was this implemented in all regions of the State party and at all levels?\\n\\nThe Committee commended the State party for its efforts to create memorials of the Holocaust. There were 158 attacks based on religion recorded in 2023. What measures were in place to ensure efficient investigations of these incidents and to develop protection measures? There had also been an increase in cases of vandalism of religious sites and profanation in recent years. What measures were in place to put an end to these practices?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the police code of conduct required police to act with empathy toward vulnerable people. The State party collected data on hate speech and hate crimes, including data on racially motivated crimes.\\n\\nIn Greek prisons, data was collected on nationality. Foreigners from 101 nationalities made up 50 per cent of the prison population. These were persons who were convicted and serving these sentences in Greek prisons. Greece was on the crossroads of many routes, and many people in prisons in Greece were engaged in cross-border criminal activity.\\n\\nThe Ombudsperson received discrimination complaints. Racial discrimination complaints made up seven per cent of complaints received in 2023, up from two per cent in 2022. The labour inspectorate examined complaints of workplace discrimination. The inspectorate was empowered to instigate administrative sanctions. Three cases it investigated in 2023 involved discrimination on the grounds of nationality.\\n\\nThe police had established specialised departments to address violent hate crimes and hate speech and provide support to victims in Attica and the Eastern Aegean region. A hotline and online form for reporting hate crimes had been implemented, and several campaigns were underway on online hate speech. The police force was cooperating with civil society, which provided training to upgrade the capacities of police staff.\\n\\nThe Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure had been revised to make them more victim centred. Courts had been redistributed to improve citizens\\' access across the State. Domestic violence legislation had also been modernised.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, asked for statistics on victims of discrimination who had benefitted from free legal aid. There was a large gap between the records of racist violence of the Racist Violence Reporting NetworkOpens in new window and the Government. Why was this? On what basis was the second national action plan on addressing racism being devised?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said that it was quite shocking that 50 per cent of prisoners in Greece were non-nationals.\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert said that the State\\'s regulations on the provision of legal aid appeared to limit access to it. Would it consider implementing a system of reviewing all requests for legal aid, regardless of the type of crime?\\n\\nA Committee Expert asked whether the labour inspectorate assigned fines for workplace discrimination. Why were non-nationals in Attica most impacted by racist crimes? How did the State party apply the recommendations of the Racist Violence Reporting Network? The Expert welcomed the guide on reporting hate crimes. Were victims made aware of this guide?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the national action plan against racism and intolerance focused on addressing hate crimes, empowering minorities, and eliminating discrimination based on various characteristics. One key initiative was the guide for victims on reporting hate crimes, which had been translated into nine languages and distributed to migrant reception centres and published online. Several training activities had been held to improve State authorities\\' response to hate crimes.\\n\\nThe National Council against Racism and Intolerance had held meetings with civil society to develop the second national action plan on addressing racism and intolerance. It had secured funding to improve victims\\' access to State services. The Council would review the Committee\\'s recommendations and include them in the second national action plan, which would focus on strengthening data collection on hate crimes and developing more services for victims.\\n\\nThe Skills Lab initiative had been piloted nationwide. New curricula promoted human rights education and intercultural communication. Training courses were offered for teachers on human rights and inclusion. A digital platform for reporting school bullying and violence had been launched. As of April 2024, over 700 reports had been received, 10 per cent of which related to racism.\\n\\nVarious actions had been taken to provide education about the Holocaust. Greece was one of the first countries to return the property of victims of the Holocaust. The State collected data on vandalism of religious sites. In 2015, 147 cases were recorded.\\n\\nThe procedure for applying for free legal aid was very simple. Applicants needed only to supply documents proving that they had low income. Victims of almost all crimes could apply for this aid. Lawyers could be appointed for defendants in serious crimes with punishments of five years imprisonment or more.\\n\\nOn some occasions, victims of racist violence went to the Racist Violence Reporting Network but not to public authorities. In 2023, 115 cases had been opened by authorities. There was not a big gap between the number of cases collected by authorities and by the Network. More than half of the population lived in Attica. This was why most racist crimes were reported in this region.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said 18 per cent of asylum camp residents did not enjoy basic material conditions, including food and financial assistance. There were only 29 doctors, 92 nurses and 69 interpreters deployed across all the camps, some of which had more than 1,000 residents. What measures were in place to improve the situation in the camps and ensure that the detention of foreign nationals was only done as a last resort? How was the State party ensuring access to interpretation services for foreign nationals? What efforts had been made to develop a statelessness establishment procedure? How was the State party addressing barriers to refugees accessing official documents?\\n\\nWhat steps had been taken to investigate alleged violations of human rights in the context of border management and to prevent such violations? Was there regular independent surveillance of border forces and efforts to strengthen their capacity? Since March 2020, a significant deterioration had been noted in the security and safety of persons from third countries seeking asylum in the east of Greece. There had been reports of summary forced return of persons who had entered from Türkiye, secret detention without sufficient safeguards, confiscation of personal effects, and intrusive searches. There were also reports of private individuals towing and removing engines from asylum seekers\\' boats, and assisting officials in carrying out forced returns.\\n\\nGreece had not signed the statelessness convention and the Presidential decree on the statelessness determination procedure had not been promulgated. Around 3,740 people in Greece had stated that they had no nationality. What measures would the State party take to better address the issue of statelessness?\\n\\nThe Committee had previously expressed concern regarding low salaries and long working hours for migrant workers, particularly in the agricultural sector. What measures were in place to improve the situation of migrant workers? Was there a safe and accessible way of filing complaints related to workplace discrimination? What measures were in place to support undocumented migrants and protect them from trafficking and forced labour?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said seminars on human rights and diversity had been provided for over 1,600 public servants. Seminars had been held on the Holocaust for members of the Orthodox Church of Greece and on the basic principles of Islam for prison officers. Over 160 integrity advisors had also been trained and certified to support integrity in the public service. The national school of the judiciary provided mandatory training on human rights, gender-based violence and other topics. In 2024, 15 seminars had been planned for judges and 12 for court staff.\\n\\nGreece directly implemented the Convention in domestic law, which was why court decisions did not directly reference the Convention.\\n\\nIf infringements of labour laws were found, labour inspectors could impose administrative sanctions and fines, and file serious cases of non-compliance with the Prosecutor.\\n\\nRefugee children could enrol in reception classes without documentation. Language classes were offered for students after school hours. Educational guides assisted teachers in making refugee students feel welcome and safe.\\n\\nGreece was facing challenges with the arrival of third country nationals seeking to enter Europe through Türkiye. It had accelerated asylum procedures through the digitisation of asylum procedures. Health care insurance and tax identification numbers were provided to asylum seekers, who could access employment and healthcare throughout the State.\\n\\nOne of the main priorities of Greece\\'s migration policy was to improve asylum conditions. Case managers carried out rapid assessments of new arrivals\\' needs. Vulnerable persons were provided with specialised protection. More interpreters were being provided in collaboration with various public and private organizations and civil society. The \"HELIOS\" integration system offered support to refugees to access the labour market, health and education. Another initiative was specifically focused on providing language, vocational and intercultural training to refugees seeking to enter the job market.\\n\\nMigration legislation had been amended to reduce the number of migrants in informal employment. An agreement had been reached with Egypt on the provision of temporary employment to Egyptian citizens in the agricultural sector. An agreement was also reached with Bangladeshi citizens to improve access to formal employment. These agreements reenforced legal pathways to migration.\\n\\nThe average time taken to process asylum applications was now 100 days; formerly processing took years. Greece collaborated with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to develop a new system of naturalisation that was fairer for refugees and stateless persons. Around 55 applications for Greek citizenship had been received; only 16 were still pending, citizenship had been granted for the rest.\\n\\nPolice had circulated guidelines on the protection of the fundamental rights of refugees arriving in the State. No third country national was to be returned until their asylum application had been processed.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur, said violence and excessive use of force had been reported in asylum centres. Could the delegation comment on this? Mr. Diaby congratulated the State party on efforts to formalise the status of stateless persons. Did the State party intend to ratify the statelessness convention? How was the State party responding to racist incidents in sport?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert asked about the results of the human rights education strategies implemented by the State.\\n\\nFAITH DIKELEDI PANSY TLAKULA, Committee Expert and Follow-Up Rapporteur, said the Committee had previously recommended that the State party provide training to teachers on providing education to migrant children, ensure individual assessment of asylum applications, and protect against refoulement. What efforts had been made to improve migrants\\' access to asylum procedures and education?\\n\\nAnother Committee Expert said that in recent years, there had been a rise in hate speech across the world, including in Greece. What measures were in place to tackle racist hate speech targeting migrants and minorities, and xenophobia?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the State was proud of improvements that had been made in the situation on the State\\'s islands. The Hellenic Coast Guard\\'s practices followed international law. All allegations of pushbacks were appropriately investigated by monitoring bodies. From 2015 to the present, the Coast Guard had rescued over 250,000 persons at sea. From 2013, Coast Guard officers had been trained in basic human rights principles.\\n\\nGreece was stepping up efforts to prevent trafficking in persons through legal and policy instruments. The national action plan on trafficking in persons was being updated to address financial and labour exploitation. The State party had organised seminars and created standards on the financial aspects of these crimes. New forms of exploitation had been added to legislation. Accommodation, medical care and legal counselling were provided to victims of trafficking in persons. A leaflet on human trafficking had been produced in several languages.\\n\\nThe State party was prioritising the ratification of International Labour Organization convention 29 on forced labour. This process was expected to be completed soon. A plan for the prevention of labour exploitation was formulated by the State each year and preventative inspections were carried out twice a year in vulnerable sectors. Employees could file complaints through an online anonymous complaints service, by email or a telephone hotline. The State provided migrant workers with information about their rights.\\n\\nA programme was in place to increase access to medical staff in asylum centres through measures such as the temporary transfer of medical personnel. Around 16,200 refugee students from 70 different countries were enrolled in Greek educational institutions. Case managers trained in the best interests of the child monitored age assessment procedures, which would soon be harmonised across all European Union Member States.\\n\\nGreece had ratified the regional conventions on safety in sport matches and had implemented legislation that prohibited banners at sporting matches with racist or sexist content.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said Greece only formally recognised one minority, Thrace Muslims. Why were other minority groups not recognised as minorities? What data was collected on minorities? How well represented was the Muslim minority in public bodies and in elected roles at national and local levels?\\n\\nWhat outcomes had been achieved by the last national strategy on the inclusion of the Roma and what progress had been made in implementing the current strategy? Were the Roma consulted about policies and strategies that affected them? Roma people reportedly continued to be victims of discrimination in Greece when trying to access healthcare, housing and employment. Many Roma people lived below the poverty threshold and struggled to access basic services. What measures were in place to ensure equal access for Roma children to education and schooling? What measures were in place to improve access to paid employment and quality healthcare for the Roma? Roma often lacked access to heating, running water and toilets. How was the State party preventing forced evictions and fines for illegal construction? Roma people faced long, costly judicial procedures to acquire Greek nationality. How was the State party promoting their access to nationality?\\n\\nThe Committee noted the adoption of several laws and the national strategy in favour of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. However, this community continued to be subjected to discrimination in schools and public services. What measures were in place to tackle such discrimination? What results had the national strategy achieved?\\n\\nThere were reports of migrant women, including pregnant women, having been assaulted by Greek Coast Guards. Greece had the highest rate of femicide in Europe. What measures were in place to address violence against women?\\n\\nWhat statistics did the State party have on people of African descent and their integration in public life? What activities had been undertaken as part of the International Decade for People of African Descent? How was the State party combatting the multiple forms of discrimination faced by this group? What measures were in place to implement the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action? Was there a formal mechanism in place to assess its implementation?\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said the term \"minority\" in Greece was understood under stricter criteria than those of the Committee. The State party respected the principle of self-identification. Groups of people who were not recognised as a minority enjoyed all rights under the Convention. Four members of the Hellenic Parliament were Muslims, and more than 100 Muslims had been elected to public bodies.\\n\\nThe Roma had expressed the will not to be considered as an ethnic minority. Authorities paid particular attention to this vulnerable group. The State had made the civil registry process easier and more efficient for the Roma. The previous strategy on Roma inclusion provided specific interventions to address early school dropouts and support access to health and housing. Implementation of this strategy was independently reviewed. There were also 85 local action plans on Roma support elaborated with the Roma population. There was an open, independent consultation platform with 13 Roma organizations that met every three months to devise strategies for Roma inclusion.\\n\\nRoma people were eligible for all State welfare benefits. The State party was promoting the Roma\\'s participation in education and the labour market. The public employment service implemented targeted programmes for the Roma, such as 15,000-euro subsidies for Roma who started a business and training and certification in technical jobs.\\n\\nThe Government had taken measures to facilitate the inclusion of Roma children in education. Psychosocial support was provided to vulnerable students in schools. Roma children could be enrolled in schools without official documentation. Teacher training programmes were provided on combatting early school dropouts and supporting Roma children.\\n\\nThe State party did not have records of complaints against Coast Guard officials regarding sexual assault of pregnant women. This year, there had been 12 victims of femicide. The State party had ratified the Istanbul Convention and was collecting data on violence against women and conducting training in schools to raise awareness of the issue. There was a large network of structures for supporting women victims, who had access to emergency accommodation.\\n\\nThe national strategy on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons aimed to combat discrimination and promote equality for these people. All ministries carried out actions supporting these people.\\n\\nQuestions by Committee Experts\\n\\nMAZALO TEBIE, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said there were gaps between policies for the Roma and practices. What was the size of the Roma population? What were the causes of femicides in the State party and the ethnic origins of the victims? Had the State party considered making a law on femicide?\\n\\nA Committee Expert said Roma children were being segregated in Greek schools. How many Roma children were participating in and graduating from inclusive public education?\\n\\nFAITH DIKELEDI PANSY TLAKULA, Committee Expert and Follow-Up Rapporteur, said the Committee had previously expressed concern about the poor working conditions of migrant workers in the agricultural sector and the informal economy. What investigations had been carried out into the exploitation of migrant workers and what compensation was provided to victims? Were employers who imposed abusive labour conditions subjected to criminal sanctions? What training was provided to labour inspectors on identifying victims of human trafficking?\\n\\nOne Committee Expert said Greece\\'s efforts to preserve its historical monuments were commendable.\\n\\nResponses by the Delegation\\n\\nThe delegation said Greece was home to a vibrant community of people of African descent, many of whom held leading roles in civil society and public organizations. Greece fully supported the pending General Assembly resolution to declare a second International Decade for People of African DescentOpens in new window. The National Council against Racism and Intolerance was implementing measures to support the rights of people of African descent.\\n\\nThere were 120,000 Roma people in Greece, 20,000 of whom received guaranteed minimum income support. To encourage school attendance, families whose children did not attend school did not receive welfare benefits. Investments had been made to improve housing infrastructure in Roma communities.\\n\\nAround 1,600 labour inspections were carried out this year and fines were issued in around 700 cases. Twenty cases had been reported to the Public Prosecutor regarding potential victims of trafficking in persons. Standards had been developed for seasonal housing for migrant workers. The labour inspectorate\\'s staff had been increased recently. All inspectors participated in training on preventing and identifying human trafficking.\\n\\nClosing Remarks\\n\\nBAKRI SIDIKI DIABY, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, thanked the delegation for the dialogue, which had been intensive, fruitful, frank and necessary. The questions raised by the Committee aimed to assess progress in the implementation of the Convention to help the Committee to develop recommendations that were helpful to Greece.\\n\\nIOANNIS GHIKAS, Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said the dialogue had been intense but constructive, identifying issues that the State party needed to address. Greece was proud of the Greek Committee Expert Stamatia Stavrinaki, who was an excellent representative of the tradition of human rights scholarship in Greece. The strong representation of women in the delegation was a representation of the reality in Greece, where promoting women\\'s representation was a high priority. The State was proud of the progress it had made since the last review, including in protecting the rights of asylum seekers and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons.'}, {'topic': 'Race Identity', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech and racism', 'title': 'Scientific production of open access articles on hate speech: a scoping review', 'url': 'https://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/RGID/article/view/96110', 'published_date': '2024-12-16T11:17:41Z', 'source': 'revistas.ucm.es', 'content': \"Su investigación se centra en la comunicación para el cambio social, comunicación para la igualdad, comunicación de la sociedad civil, comunicación online, alfabetización informacional y mediática.

By contrasting the prohibition of prayer in secular systems with the tolerance of this slur, the paper critiques the inadequacies of current structural frameworks in addressing systemic injustice. It further explores how language shapes societal norms and proposes a framework for rethinking linguistic accountability, with a focus on scientific and sociological research. The paper concludes by recommending legislative, cultural, and educational strategies to eradicate this term, emphasizing its potential to serve as a precedent for combating other forms of hate speech.\\n\\nLanguage is a powerful tool for constructing reality. Words have the ability to heal, inspire, harm, or dehumanize. Few words encapsulate this duality as starkly as the racial slur \"nigger.\" Originating in colonial times as a means of dehumanizing African-descended individuals, this word persists as a vestige of slavery and systemic racism. While the global community recognizes hate speech as a moral and legal offense, this particular term remains paradoxically present in cultural and societal contexts. This paper explores why its abolition is necessary, examining systemic contradictions such as the prohibition of prayer in secular institutions, which reflects inconsistent applications of societal norms.\\n\\nThe word \"nigger\" is not merely a slur; it is a linguistic artifact of oppression. Its use was instrumental in the transatlantic slave trade, serving to justify inhuman treatment and the commodification of Black individuals. Even post-slavery, its usage perpetuated psychological trauma and reinforced systemic segregation. This section will:\\n\\nDiscuss its transition into contemporary usage, including its appropriation in some cultural contexts.\\n\\n2.1 Psychological and Sociological Impacts\\n\\nNumerous studies document the detrimental effects of slurs on mental health, self-perception, and societal cohesion. This section will review research on how such language perpetuates stereotypes, normalizes violence, and undermines equality.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3. The Structural Contradictions of Language and Law\\n\\n3.1 Prohibition of Prayer vs. Tolerance of Slurs\\n\\nModern secular systems often prohibit religious expression, such as prayer, in public spaces to maintain neutrality. However, the tolerance or legal protection of hate speech like \"nigger\" reveals a profound inconsistency. This section will:\\n\\nAnalyze legal frameworks governing free speech and hate speech.\\n\\nContrast the treatment of spiritual expressions and harmful language.\\n\\nExamine the ethical implications of these inconsistencies.\\n\\n3.2 Systemic Inadequacies\\n\\nThe persistence of this slur highlights structural failures in addressing racism. These include:\\n\\nEducational deficits in teaching about historical racism.\\n\\n4.1 Linguistic Accountability and Societal Health\\n\\nLanguage shapes cultural norms and individual behaviors. Allowing derogatory terms like \"nigger\" to persist undermines societal progress. Abolition serves not only as a symbolic act but as a practical step toward dismantling systemic racism.\\n\\n4.2 International Precedents\\n\\nCountries like Germany have outlawed Nazi symbols and hate speech to prevent the perpetuation of oppressive ideologies. This section will analyze these precedents and their applicability to abolishing the word \"nigger.\"\\n\\n4.3 Practical Strategies for Abolition\\n\\nLegislation: Enacting laws to classify the word as hate speech subject to penalties.\\n\\nCultural Transformation: Promoting alternative narratives and redefining societal values through media and art.\\n\\nEducation: Developing curricula that address the history and harm of this word.\\n\\nPrayer, often prohibited in secular systems, represents spiritual and personal empowerment. Its suppression contrasts sharply with the permissibility of language that dehumanizes. This section examines:\\n\\nThe role of prayer in fostering social cohesion and personal resilience.\\n\\nThe systemic bias in prioritizing secular neutrality over human dignity.\\n\\nHow addressing such contradictions can strengthen structural justice.\\n\\nThis paper proposes a unified framework to address linguistic and structural inequities:\\n\\nRestorative Justice: Encouraging reparative dialogue and reconciliation.\\n\\nLegislative Reform: Balancing free speech with protections against harm.\\n\\nGlobal Solidarity: Collaborating across cultures to combat hate speech.\\n\\nThe abolition of the word \"nigger\" represents a critical step in addressing systemic racism and linguistic harm. By treating its usage as a form of societal profligation subject to severe penalties, we signal a commitment to justice and equity. Contrasting this with the prohibition of prayer reveals deep systemic contradictions, underscoring the need for comprehensive reform. A future free of such dehumanizing language is possible through legislative action, cultural transformation, and education.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe word \"nigger\" holds a unique and deeply traumatic position in the history of racial oppression, symbolizing systemic racism and violence. Despite occasional reappropriation within Black communities, its continued use outside these contexts perpetuates harm, discrimination, and psychological trauma. This paper contrasts the societal prohibition of \"prayer\" in certain public or governmental spaces with the tolerated use of racial slurs, highlighting structural inconsistencies. By drawing from historical, psychological, and legal perspectives, this study advocates for the abolition of such language through strict societal and legal frameworks.\\n\\nHistorical Context and Systemic Impacts\\n\\nThe n-word\\'s origin as a tool of dehumanization dates back to slavery and segregation, where it was a prelude to violence, including lynching and other atrocities. Its persistence symbolizes a system that normalizes anti-Blackness and undermines societal equity. Scholars have identified the word as \"the atomic bomb of racial slurs,\" reflecting its uniquely destructive psychological and societal impact. The term reinforces systemic racism by perpetuating stereotypes and fostering environments where discrimination thrives (sources: ADL, Psychology Today).\\n\\nLegal and Psychological Perspectives\\n\\nThe legal system inconsistently addresses hate speech and racial slurs. While hate crimes laws penalize acts motivated by bias, proving intent remains challenging. The n-word often functions as a trigger for violence, demonstrating its potent psychological effects. Studies show that exposure to racial slurs can cause enduring trauma, influencing behaviors and mental health over time (sources: OHCHR, OJP, Psychology Today).\\n\\nStructural Inadequacies: Prayer vs. Hate Speech\\n\\nContrasting the restriction of prayer in public institutions with the leniency towards racial slurs highlights systemic contradictions. Prayer is often prohibited in contexts aiming to uphold neutrality and prevent marginalization. However, the tolerance of racial epithets undermines this neutrality by tacitly endorsing harm against marginalized groups. This inconsistency reveals a structural failure to equitably protect individual dignity and safety.\\n\\nRecommendations\\n\\n1. Abolition Through Legislation: Strengthen hate speech laws to explicitly include the prohibition of racial slurs, with penalties reflecting their societal harm.\\n\\n2. Education and Awareness: Implement educational initiatives to address the history and impact of such language, emphasizing its role in systemic oppression.\\n\\n3. Community Empowerment: Support the reappropriation of language within marginalized communities while discouraging its use by others to prevent perpetuation of harm.\\n\\n4. Structural Reforms: Address systemic biases in policy-making that tolerate harmful language while restricting other forms of expression.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe systemic tolerance of racial slurs like the n-word is a manifestation of structural racism that undermines societal progress. Abolishing such language requires a comprehensive approach involving legal, educational, and social reforms. Addressing this issue not only honors the dignity of those affected but also strengthens the moral and ethical fabric of society.\\n\\nIn the sprawling labyrinth of systemic governance, where laws claim to safeguard dignity and equality, a glaring hypocrisy festers. On one hand, institutions silence prayer -- a quiet invocation of hope, unity, and introspection -- under the guise of secular neutrality. On the other, these same systems shield hate speech, particularly the visceral linguistic weaponry of the word \"nigger,\" cloaking its use in the sanctity of \"free expression.\" This contradiction is not a mere oversight but a seismic failure of moral and structural integrity. The persistence of this slur serves as an indictment of the inadequacies of modern systems, exposing their complicity in perpetuating oppression while masquerading as bastions of liberty.\\n\\n1. Prayer: Silenced Benevolence\\n\\nPrayer, an act of spiritual alignment and communal solace, is systematically expunged from public spaces to uphold secularism. This prohibition is framed as essential to protecting inclusivity, yet it suppresses a harmless, often uplifting practice. The rationale behind this exclusion betrays a fear of offense, yet paradoxically, it allows offensive language -- rooted in hate -- to flourish unchecked.\\n\\n2. The N-Word: Protected Oppression\\n\\nThe n-word, a verbal relic of slavery\\'s barbarity, survives as a cultural anomaly: a word so potent in its dehumanization that it continues to wound across generations. Protected by laws intended to defend expression, it has become a totem of systemic hypocrisy. By tolerating its usage, societies tacitly endorse its underlying ideology -- one that denies humanity and perpetuates racial hierarchies.\\n\\nSanctifying Harm, Criminalizing Hope\\n\\nThe double standard between prayer and slurs unmasks a systemic prioritization of abstract ideals over tangible harm. Prayer, which often fosters connection and resilience, is suppressed as potentially divisive, while slurs, which undeniably fracture the social fabric, are tolerated. This prioritization reveals a skewed moral compass, where the avoidance of ideological discomfort supersedes the protection of human dignity.\\n\\nLegal Contradictions as a Disgrace\\n\\nSecular laws punish expressions of spirituality to preserve neutrality, yet they fail to curtail language explicitly designed to oppress. This contradiction underscores the inadequacy of frameworks that claim to champion equality while upholding structural inequities.\\n\\n1. Legislative Abolition of Hate Speech\\n\\nSocieties must confront their linguistic relics with unflinching clarity. Laws should eradicate racial slurs from public lexicons, treating them as instruments of psychological violence. This abolition would signal a decisive rejection of systemic racism.\\n\\n2. Cultural Renaissance\\n\\nA cultural movement is needed to reclaim linguistic spaces from the shadows of oppression. Through art, education, and public discourse, society must dismantle the normalized violence of slurs while redefining speech as a tool for justice, not harm.\\n\\n3. Reframing Freedom\\n\\nTrue freedom lies not in the unchecked license to harm but in the empowerment of individuals to coexist with dignity. Reframing freedom as responsibility would enable societies to prioritize collective well-being over the preservation of outdated and oppressive norms.\\n\\nThe systemic tolerance of the n-word, juxtaposed with the prohibition of prayer, symbolizes a deep moral chasm. This inconsistency is not just a structural flaw but a betrayal of justice itself. To reclaim societal integrity, we must uproot these double standards and construct frameworks that honor the intrinsic worth of every individual. The abolition of hateful language is not an attack on freedom but its ultimate affirmation -- a visionary step toward a future where words heal rather than harm.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

The texts called the men the N-word and monkeys and told them to \"go back to Africa.\"\\n\\nYoung was also charged with damaging the men\\'s vehicles. Hall had corrosive acid poured on his work truck while Hart\\'s car was splattered with paint. He\\'s been charged with second-degree criminal mischief - a felony - for the vandalism, stalking and harassment.\\n\\nMost recently, multiple Black residents received anonymous racist text messages referencing slavery. The barrage of texts happened nationwide, with people in at least 30 states reporting them. The FBI is investigating the matter.\\n\\nThe texts addressed people by their names telling them they had \"been selected to pick cotton.\" It gave a time and day that a van would be ready to pick them up to take them to a plantation.\\n\\nFunchess\\' wife was one of the people to receive a text. The widespread hate message happened around the days of the election. He believes a voter database could have been hacked.\\n\\nWaterloo police are still searching for people involved in the distribution of the flyers promoting the \"white power\" group. They ask anyone with information to call the department at (319) 291-2515.\\n\\n100 resources for fighting racism 100 resources for fighting racism Book: \\'So You Want to Talk About Race\\' by Ijeoma Oluo Educational resource: Ways You Can Help, #BlackLivesMatter Movie: \\'I Am Not Your Negro\\' (2016) Organization: Black Lives Matter Article: \\'Talking to Young Children About Race and Racism\\' TV show: \\'When They See Us\\' (2019) Book: \\'White Fragility: Why It\\'s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism\\' by Robin DiAngelo Donate: National Bail Fund Network Educational resource: Overhaul of Advocacy Instagram account: @PullUpForChange Movie: 13th (2016) Business directory: Official Black Wall Street Book: \\'How to Be an Antiracist\\' by Ibram X.

On one hand, institutions silence prayer -- a quiet invocation of hope, unity, and introspection -- under the guise of secular neutrality. On the other, these same systems shield hate speech, particularly the visceral linguistic weaponry of the word \"nigger,\" cloaking its use in the sanctity of \"free expression.\" This contradiction is not a mere oversight but a seismic failure of moral and structural integrity. The persistence of this slur serves as an indictment of the inadequacies of modern systems, exposing their complicity in perpetuating oppression while masquerading as bastions of liberty.\\n\\n---\\n\\n1. Prayer: Silenced Benevolence\\n\\nPrayer, an act of spiritual alignment and communal solace, is systematically expunged from public spaces to uphold secularism. This prohibition is framed as essential to protecting inclusivity, yet it suppresses a harmless, often uplifting practice. The rationale behind this exclusion betrays a fear of offense, yet paradoxically, it allows offensive language -- rooted in hate -- to flourish unchecked.\\n\\n2. The N-Word: Protected Oppression\\n\\nThe n-word, a verbal relic of slavery\\'s barbarity, survives as a cultural anomaly: a word so potent in its dehumanization that it continues to wound across generations. Protected by laws intended to defend expression, it has become a totem of systemic hypocrisy. By tolerating its usage, societies tacitly endorse its underlying ideology -- one that denies humanity and perpetuates racial hierarchies.\\n\\nSanctifying Harm, Criminalizing Hope\\n\\nThe double standard between prayer and slurs unmasks a systemic prioritization of abstract ideals over tangible harm. Prayer, which often fosters connection and resilience, is suppressed as potentially divisive, while slurs, which undeniably fracture the social fabric, are tolerated. This prioritization reveals a skewed moral compass, where the avoidance of ideological discomfort supersedes the protection of human dignity.\\n\\nLegal Contradictions as a Disgrace\\n\\nSecular laws punish expressions of spirituality to preserve neutrality, yet they fail to curtail language explicitly designed to oppress. This contradiction underscores the inadequacy of frameworks that claim to champion equality while upholding structural inequities.\\n\\n1. Legislative Abolition of Hate Speech\\n\\nSocieties must confront their linguistic relics with unflinching clarity. Laws should eradicate racial slurs from public lexicons, treating them as instruments of psychological Terrorism Nexis. This abolition would signal a decisive rejection of systemic racism.\\n\\n2. Cultural Renaissance\\n\\nA cultural movement is needed to reclaim linguistic spaces from the shadows of oppression. Through art, education, and public discourse, society must dismantle the normalized violence of slurs while redefining speech as a tool for justice, not harm.\\n\\n3. Reframing Freedom\\n\\nTrue freedom lies not in the unchecked license to harm but in the empowerment of individuals to coexist with dignity. Reframing freedom as responsibility would enable societies to prioritize collective well-being over the preservation of outdated and oppressive norms.\\n\\nThe systemic tolerance of the n-word, juxtaposed with the prohibition of prayer, symbolizes a deep moral chasm. This inconsistency is not just a structural flaw but a betrayal of justice itself. To reclaim societal integrity, we must uproot these double standards and construct frameworks that honor the intrinsic worth of every individual. The abolition of hateful language is not an attack on freedom but its ultimate affirmation -- a visionary step toward a future where words heal rather than harm.\\n\\nLet me know if you\\'d like a more expansive development of this framework or if you need specific case studies or precedents woven into the argument.\\n\\nAuthor\\'s Note:\\n\\nThis work delves into the mechanisms of human domination and exploitation, examining the scientific, psychological, and social techniques that have historically underpinned systems of enslavement. The purpose is not to glorify these practices but to expose them, offering insights into the systemic nature of oppression and its lingering effects on contemporary society.\\n\\nEnslavement begins with the dehumanization of a group, achieved through pseudoscientific frameworks like phrenology or genetic determinism, which historically justified racial hierarchies.\\n\\nPsychological manipulation involves redefining identities, labeling the oppressed as \"inferior,\" and reinforcing these ideas through media, education, and policy.\\n\\nCognitive dissonance allowed slaveholders to reconcile moral beliefs with inhumane actions.\\n\\nLearned helplessness among the enslaved was cultivated through consistent punishment, restricting autonomy, and dismantling resilience.\\n\\nTechniques like whipping, starvation, and mutilation served as direct tools of control, conditioning enslaved individuals through fear.\\n\\nModern parallels include systemic incarceration and labor exploitation, which replicate patterns of physical domination.\\n\\nPsychological Chains\\n\\n\"Breaking the will\" through the separation of families, destruction of cultural heritage, and denial of education.\\n\\nStockholm Syndrome and internalized oppression: Psychological phenomena that bind the enslaved to their oppressors emotionally and ideologically.\\n\\nEnslavement thrives on economic incentives. The transatlantic slave trade, for example, reduced individuals to units of labor, commodified for profit.\\n\\nToday, exploitative labor practices, human trafficking, and wage slavery echo historical systems.\\n\\nThe Role of Capitalism\\n\\nEnslavement and exploitation are intertwined with capitalistic systems that prioritize profit over human dignity.\\n\\n\"Debt bondage\" as a modern form of slavery demonstrates the seamless adaptation of enslavement into contemporary economic structures.\\n\\nTerms like \"nigger,\" \"boy,\" or \"property\" served to degrade and reinforce power dynamics.\\n\\nLinguistic control is a subtle yet potent tool, shaping collective consciousness and maintaining hierarchical systems.\\n\\nIndoctrination and Propaganda\\n\\nThe use of religion and education to justify slavery, teaching obedience as a divine mandate.\\n\\nMedia and cultural representations continue to perpetuate stereotypes that validate systemic oppression.\\n\\nEpigenetic studies suggest that the trauma of enslavement has biological consequences, affecting descendants of enslaved populations.\\n\\nCultural fragmentation and identity loss remain scars that hinder societal cohesion.\\n\\nSystemic Continuities\\n\\nPolicing, redlining, and unequal education systems mirror historical mechanisms of control.\\n\\nPsychological oppression persists through implicit biases and structural racism, maintaining a legacy of inequality.\\n\\nCultural revival and education as tools to dismantle historical narratives.\\n\\nEmpowerment through community building and fostering resilience against systemic oppression.\\n\\nJustice and Reparations\\n\\nExploring legal frameworks for reparations as a means of rectifying historical injustices.\\n\\nAdvocating for policy reforms to dismantle systemic oppression and rebuild equitable structures.\\n\\nEnslavement, in its many forms, represents humanity\\'s darkest capabilities. Understanding its mechanisms is the first step toward dismantling oppressive systems and fostering a world where freedom and dignity prevail.\\n\\nConference Research Paper: The Cognitive Science of Subjugation\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nThe systematic subjugation of individuals and groups is deeply rooted in psychological manipulation and cognitive conditioning. This paper explores the cognitive mechanisms underlying subjugation, focusing on learned helplessness, dehumanization, cognitive dissonance, and the interplay of authority and obedience. Drawing on historical examples and modern research, we analyze how these techniques maintain power hierarchies and suggest pathways to resilience and liberation.\\n\\nSubjugation is not solely a product of physical domination but relies heavily on psychological mechanisms to ensure compliance and perpetuate inequality. From slavery and colonialism to modern systems of control, the science of subjugation reveals how cognitive processes are exploited to maintain dominance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n2. Learned Helplessness: Conditioning Compliance\\n\\nCoined by Martin Seligman in the 1960s, learned helplessness occurs when individuals repeatedly experience uncontrollable negative events, leading to resignation and inaction.\\n\\nMechanisms:\\n\\nRepeated exposure to trauma diminishes the belief in personal agency.\\n\\nThis was evident in chattel slavery, where brutal punishment reinforced compliance by eroding resistance efforts.\\n\\nModern Contexts:\\n\\nInstitutional racism and systemic poverty create environments that perpetuate feelings of helplessness, hindering social mobility and fostering generational cycles of dependency.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3. Dehumanization: A Cognitive Justification for Oppression\\n\\nDehumanization involves perceiving others as less than human, reducing empathy and enabling moral disengagement.\\n\\nNeurocognitive Insights:\\n\\nStudies show reduced activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (associated with social cognition) when individuals view dehumanized groups, such as stereotyped images of the homeless or oppressed racial groups.\\n\\nHistorical Applications:\\n\\nEnslavers dehumanized African populations through pseudoscientific classifications, portraying them as biologically inferior.\\n\\nNazi propaganda used dehumanization to justify the Holocaust, depicting Jews as vermin.\\n\\n---\\n\\n4. Cognitive Dissonance: Resolving the Moral Conflict\\n\\nCognitive dissonance theory explains how individuals reconcile conflicting beliefs and actions. In the context of subjugation:\\n\\nHistorical Examples:\\n\\nSlaveholders viewed themselves as moral Christians, rationalizing slavery by constructing narratives of \"civilizing savages\" or using religious justifications.\\n\\nColonial powers framed imperialism as a moral obligation (\"the white man\\'s burden\"), masking exploitation as benevolence.\\n\\nModern Implications:\\n\\nDiscrimination is often justified through stereotypes, reducing dissonance for those complicit in systemic inequality.\\n\\nStanley Milgram\\'s experiments demonstrated how individuals obey authority figures even when it conflicts with personal morality.\\n\\nApplication to Subjugation:\\n\\nIn hierarchical systems like slavery or authoritarian regimes, obedience was enforced through fear and legitimized by societal norms.\\n\\nAuthority figures (e.g., overseers, police) serve as enforcers of systemic control, compelling compliance through perceived legitimacy.\\n\\nInsights from Neuroscience:\\n\\nBrain imaging reveals that individuals defer moral decision-making to authority figures, reducing activation in regions associated with autonomous moral reasoning.\\n\\n---\\n\\n6. Resilience and Liberation: Counteracting Subjugation\\n\\nUnderstanding cognitive mechanisms opens pathways for fostering resistance and psychological liberation.\\n\\nEducation and Critical Thinking:\\n\\nTeaching marginalized groups to recognize and deconstruct oppressive narratives empowers autonomy.\\n\\nCognitive behavioral interventions can help mitigate the effects of learned helplessness.\\n\\nRestoring Humanity:\\n\\nInitiatives that promote empathy and humanize oppressed groups counteract the psychological effects of dehumanization.\\n\\nMedia and cultural representation play critical roles in reshaping perceptions.\\n\\nThe cognitive science of subjugation reveals how psychological manipulation sustains systems of oppression. By understanding these mechanisms, we can develop strategies to dismantle entrenched power dynamics and foster societal resilience. The path to liberation begins with unmasking the mental chains of subjugation, empowering individuals to reclaim their agency and humanity.\\n\\n1. Seligman, M. E. (1972). Learned helplessness.

He considers X to be a \"digital town square\". Through his fierce advocacy, Musk has pushed for a powerful yet not much-talked-about idea: citizen journalism. The eccentric billionaire sees X as a replacement for traditional media platforms, and citizen journalists as substitutes for professional journalists.\\n\\nIn the book, The Medium is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects, Marshall McLuhan wrote, \"Societies have always been shaped more by the nature of the media by which men communicate... It is impossible to understand social and cultural changes without a knowledge of the workings of media.\" This certainly holds true for the post-Musk era of X and his advocacy of citizen journalism.\\n\\nIt is hard to define who a citizen journalist is, since the term is loaded and has a diverse set of scholarly definitions and overlapping meanings. In simple terms, a citizen journalist is any person who engages in journalistic activity but is not a trained reporter or professional. As Musk puts it, citizen journalism is \"...a new model of news, which is to gather information from people who are at the scene, who are experts in the field, summarise the experts in the field and people who are at whatever event is being talked about, and aggregate that into a real-time news feed.\"\\n\\nThe idea of citizen journalism is not new. One could argue that during the Indian freedom struggle, many freedom fighters, who were not professional journalists, brought out their newspapers, magazines, pamphlets, and periodicals to raise awareness of the true nature of the British Raj. They were, in fact, \"citizen journalists\". In 1963, Abraham Zapruder filmed a 26-second horrifying video that recorded the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy. In 2008, when Mumbai was rocked by a cowardly terrorist attack, online platforms were flooded with stories and photos from citizens present near the attack sites. In December 2010, in Tunisia, the video of Mohamed Bouazizi\\'s self-immolation triggered the Jasmine Revolution and the Arab Spring. All these instances are emblematic of citizen journalism.\\n\\nThe rise of new technologies has given a boost to citizen journalism. It is challenging traditional media, breaking down the silos and walls that once existed between institutional news dissemination and the roles citizens now play in it. Gone are the days when only journalists and media houses were the gatekeepers of information. Now, for those willing, there are plenty of mediums and platforms to broadcast events, views, and information.\\n\\nTraditional media is competing with two forces. The first is the competition from new technologies and newer mediums. The second is the competition from the \"former\" audience, who have turned into journalists, thanks to mobile cameras and the internet. As Elon Musk tweeted, \"...You are the media now\" and \"...You can do live video easily from your phone.\"\\n\\nThe rise of citizen journalism is also attributed to the reputational damage suffered by serious journalism due to the commercial and other vested interests of media conglomerates. Once a venerable profession, journalism has been tarnished by the insidious rise of yellow-page journalism, where news is used to manipulate public opinion, rather than being a noble pursuit of speaking truth to power. The media has largely ceased to be a profitable business, as advertisers shift to online platforms. Yet, the rich and powerful continue to pour money into it to harness, create, and maintain favourable public opinion and political power.\\n\\nThe people who were supposed to be the vanguard of journalism became fixated on maintaining the status quo, reflected in their complacent attitude and institutional biases. Traditional media today lacks passion. \"Many big-media journalists are now cautious, well-paid conformists, distant from their audiences and more responsive to urban elites, powerful people, and mega-corporations -- especially the ones they work for,\" says journalist James Poniewozik.\\n\\nTake, for example, a survey conducted by the Pew Research Centre, which found that \"about three-quarters of US adults (73 per cent) say they have seen inaccurate news coverage about the election at least somewhat often, including 37 per cent who have seen this kind of information extremely or very often.\" Musk, a product of media glorification, has fiercely criticised mainstream \"legacy\" media and has argued that in citizen journalism \"people are able to disseminate news without an establishment bias.\" He believes that this type of journalism is \"infinitely superior\" and \"breaks the monopoly held by a handful of editors.\"\\n\\nBut the remedy provided by citizen journalism might be worse than the malady. Due to traditional media being run through a centralised structure, it is easier for a willing state to set accountability. This becomes a challenge in a highly decentralised setup. As far as the legacy media\\'s institutional bias is concerned, citizen journalism will also fall victim to individual biases. Online platforms are repositories of confirmation biases, propelled by algorithms, which will also manifest in citizen journalism. Currently, non-traditional platforms are used to call out the recognised biases of legacy media. But when social media itself becomes an echo chamber, recognising bias becomes impossible, and no one is there to call it out.\\n\\nCitizen journalism, despite all its claims of an \\'ideal speech situation\\', degrades into a space of vitriol, racism, bigotry, misinformation, rumours, and hate speech.\\n\\nRecently, The Guardian quit the X platform, citing \"disturbing content\", including racism. The World Bank ceased paid advertising on \\'X\\' after advertisements were shown under a racist post, according to a CBS News report in September 2024. According to a report by CNN, Musk publicly endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jewish communities push \"hatred against Whites.\" Musk called an antisemitic tweet \"the actual truth\", which accused Jewish people of undermining Western civilisation by supporting immigration. Research conducted by ISD and CASM Technology for BBC Panorama revealed that when Elon Musk took over \\'X\\', it fostered an environment that allowed thousands of new accounts to quickly begin following channels known for misogynistic content on the platform.\\n\\nWhat is true for the relationship between legacy media and the rich is also true for citizen journalism and social media. Take the case of X and Elon Musk, for the road to hell is paved with good intentions. He claimed neutrality and a level playing field for all sides. However, as The New York Times reported, \"It has become starkly evident that the left, the Democrats, do not have the same social media platforms to push their agenda... It has left Democrats in a huge deficit.\" Elon Musk, like other billionaires, wanted to have his medium, and he grabbed it at a huge premium.\\n\\nWalter Isaacson, in the authorised biography of Musk, called it out: \"Over the years, whenever he was in a dark place or felt threatened, it took him back to the horrors of being bullied on the playground. Now he had the chance to own the playground.\"\\n\\nJournalism is a professional pursuit requiring special skills, training, and expertise. Though citizens can participate and connect constructively with the news process, they cannot replace journalists and institutionalised journalism.\\n\\nIn 2014, speaking to a digital news publication, senior journalist Shekhar Gupta said, \"I don\\'t believe in citizen journalists. I say give me citizen doctors and citizen lawyers, and I\\'ll give you citizen journalists. We learn the journalistic skill, we come with bullshit detectors, which get better with age and experience.\" Journalism is an exercise in sophistication, requiring an understanding of the system, devouring documents in search of information, conducting investigations, and having the courage to question the newsmakers.\\n\\nHowever, traditional media cannot afford to have a snobbish and disdainful attitude towards the public. It will have to accept that people cannot be excluded, and the process must be made participatory. People need someone who listens to them without arrogance or claiming moral high ground. The onus is on legacy journalists to be passionate and innovative. The letters to editors are one such way of making people feel heard.\\n\\nCitizen journalism, despite its lofty ideals of equality, is also dominated by a privileged few who possess the technical means, educational know-how, and time to spare. The masses remain voiceless and unheard, a vacuum that has also persisted in legacy media. Journalists, newsmakers, and the audience, with a bottom-up approach, need to fill this gap and build an equitable space for those who require the news the most but are also the most ignored in the process. A mob claiming to represent the masses is as harmful as the select few deciding for the masses.\\n\\nIn the past, institutional journalists and journalism have faced many crises head-on. However, due to the velocity of technological changes, the media space is far more fragmented, with more claimants than ever before. It is more contested, as the former audience -- enabled by the pervasiveness of the internet and driven by the faltering credibility of traditional media -- is taking matters into their own hands. The onus is on professional journalists to improve their standing and ensure the restoration of trust in once-revered institutional journalism. People need credible news, but not from sources that disguise avarice behind the gauzy language of objectivity and impartiality, nor from people shouting from soapboxes.'}, {'topic': 'Race Identity', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech and racism', 'title': \"Anti-racism campaigner's London book events cancelled amid threat of far-right violence\", 'url': 'https://www.aol.co.uk/news/anti-racism-campaigner-london-book-060035764.html', 'published_date': '2024-11-23T06:14:15Z', 'source': 'Yahoo News', 'content': 'Anti-racism campaigner\\'s London book events cancelled amid threat of far-right violence\\n\\nBen Quinn\\n\\n23 November 2024 at 7:00 am\\n\\nHanif Kureishi, Billy Bragg and freedom of speech groups have voiced alarm after a number of venues cancelled events to promote a book by an anti-racism campaigner amid threats and fears that the recent riots have emboldened the far right.\\n\\nAn east London bookshop this week became the latest venue to pull plans to promote Rebel Sounds, a book about the role music plays in the fight against racism and other struggles.\\n\\nIt follows the scrapping of similar events at bookshops and pubs over the last few weeks, and the cancellation by the BFI London film festival (LFF) last month of a screening of a documentary about the far right.\\n\\nJoe Mulhall, the author of Rebel Sounds and director of research at the anti-racism organisation Hope Not Hate, said: \"Sadly, it feels like we are going backwards.\"\\n\\nMulhall held an event at a secret location last Sunday night after a pub cancelled what was intended to be an evening of discussion and music about the book.\\n\\n\"The irony wasn\\'t lost on us that we were having to meet in secret when this is a book about people being forced to do things in a clandestine way in the past in Britain because of the rise of the National Front or other countries because of repressive regimes,\" he said.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t blame small independent venues like bookshops and pubs but you would think that the LFF is big enough that they shouldn\\'t have cancelled. They have the capacity and resources to protect an event if they wanted to.\"\\n\\nAnother bookshop that cancelled a few weeks ago after receiving threats has now pulled out of plans to restage the event in December after getting new threats immediately after it was listed online.\\n\\nThreats have been made by email and in phone calls, while extremists from groups angered by Hope Not Hate\\'s work have been publishing numbers on social media and urging supporters to call.\\n\\nPolice were called to a branch of Waterstones in late September when a far-right activist took a seat in the front row and attempted to disrupt the event.\\n\\nThe development has shocked artists and veterans of anti-racist campaigns who had believed the days of venues being in fear of the far right had been consigned to the past.\\n\\nBut the summer violence - described by Keir Starmer as far-right riots - has contributed to a changed atmosphere. It comes after the far right and conspiracy theorists have mobilised aggressive protests against venues hosting shows featuring drag queens reading to young children.\\n\\nBragg, the socialist singer-songwriter whose own anti-fascist activism through music features in Mulhall\\'s book, told the Guardian: \"This reminds me of the 1970s and 80s when we had to do solidarity gigs for people.\\n\\n\"People\\'s safety is so important but we need to stand up to this kind of thing, which really is a freedom of speech issue and in this case there are threats of violence.\"\\n\\nKureishi, whose fiction has drawn from his own experience of the threat posed to British Asians by the National Front in his youth, said he was shocked to hear about Mulhall\\'s experience. Another British writer, Guy Gunaratne, said: \"That these readings are now being conducted clandestinely should concern everyone committed to free speech.\"\\n\\nJemimah Steinfeld, the CEO of Index on Censorship, said she was concerned about what appeared to be a \"worrying trend\". \"If even an organisation like the BFI is afraid then what hope is there for smaller venues and what message does it send out? You have to put the people working at those places first, but we are also seeing a retreat into safer spaces and it\\'s something we as a society will regret.\"\\n\\nDaniel Gorman, the director of English PEN, said: \"English PEN is deeply concerned that threats from the far right have led to venues cancelling planned events with writers and artists.

It highlighted online shopping scams as most prevalent and surpassing identity fraud.\\n\\nThere has also been a 12% increase in sextortion reports, with at least 43 cases each week. Deepfake activity is becoming more prevalent, and hate speech and racism is also up.\\n\\nThis aligns with an almost 25% increase in people using Netsafe\\'s harmful digital communications helpline and more than 375,000 unique website visitors seeking tips and tools to navigate online safety challenges.\\n\\nNetsafe CEO Brent Carey says the digital environment is evolving rapidly and changes to the HDCA are required to ensure the country is protected from online harm in the future.\\n\\n\"The advancements in deep fake technology are an example of how New Zealand\\'s legal framework not keeping pace. While local legislation offers some protection for AI-created or modified images, video or audio, stronger legal protections and resources are required to manage the increasing volume of synthetic content.\"\\n\\nNetsafe\\'s ongoing focus is developing solutions and programmes to help combat current, and future needs when addressing online safety. In the last year it launched a range of initiatives, including a partnership with Cybera to recover lost funds for scam victims; relaunching an AI-powered scam-baiting tool, Re:Scam; and introducing education programmes including the relaunch of animated series for children, Hectors World, in English and Te Reo.\\n\\nSextortion - The 12.2% increase in sextortion reports, where scammers threaten to use images of victims online unless further demands are met, saw at least 43 cases reported each week. The impact for victims includes severe emotional distress leading to depression and suicidal thoughts.\\n\\nDeepfakes - The increased prevalence of these highly convincing fake images, videos, or audio, which are created using AI, requires urgent government action to implement stronger legal protections and resources to manage deep fakes.\\n\\nHate speech and racism - Similar to deepfakes, the current legal framework under the HDCA is insufficient to address hate speech issues, particularly when harm is directed at groups rather than individuals. Netsafe is advocating for legislative reform to extend protections against online harm targeted at groups.\\n\\nScams - Most common scam reports were identity fraud, consumer investment fraud / online shopping, employment fraud, and romance scams, where scammers use a fake identity to establish a relationship and gain personal information or money from a victim.\\n\\nAn emerging trend this year shows the average amount lost by males is 31% higher than that of females.\\n\\nChild Sexual Abuse Materials (CSAM) - There were 1,645 CSAM reports received in FY24. Netsafe processed 1,092 reports of CSAM which were then passed on to the appropriate law enforcement or regulatory agencies in New Zealand.\\n\\nAdditionally, Netsafe is New Zealand\\'s representative for INHOPE, the International Association of Internet Hotlines. These hotlines play a key role in the global fight against the online exploitation of children and help to significantly reduce the time it takes to delete material online.\\n\\nEducation initiatives - Working alongside schools is a priority with wide ranging programmes launched that included online safety for primary aged children with Hector\\'s World to guidance for educators on AI.\\n\\nNew school\\'s resource, Kete, was launched to meet the need from teachers for access to online safety resources in their classrooms with almost 7,000 educators registered.\\n\\n\"Looking ahead our focus remains on innovation, trust, impartiality and tech-for-good tools,\" says Carey. \"With a refreshed online presence and new services on the horizon, we are ready to expand our impact nationwide.\"\\n\\nAs well as continuing advocating for changes to the HDCA, Netsafe is also calling for a national scams centre to help address the financial and mental impact scams are having in the current digital landscape.\\n\\nAdditional key focus areas for Netsafe include:\\n\\nCarey says the essential work the Netsafe team does is reflected in it being the organisation\\'s most successful year in terms of the number of people helped and international partnerships being negotiated.\\n\\n\"Together as a team we will continue shaping a safer digital future for New Zealand.\"'}], [], [{'topic': 'Religion Prayer', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech in religious communities', 'title': \"UN Secretary-General's remarks at the opening session of the 10th United Nations Alliance of Civilizations Global Forum [bilingual as delivered; scroll down for all-English version]\", 'url': 'https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2024-11-26/un-secretary-generals-remarks-the-opening-session-of-the-10th-united-nations-alliance-of-civilizations-global-forum-bilingual-delivered-scroll-down-for-all-english', 'published_date': '2024-11-26T11:50:19Z', 'source': 'United Nations', 'content': 'Excelentíssimo Senhor Professor Doutor Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, Presidente da República Portuguesa,\\n\\nAgradeço a Vossa Excelência e ao Governo de Portugal, na pessoa do Senhor Ministro de Estado e dos Negócios Estrangeiros, a hospitalidade e o acolhimento deste Fórum Mundial da Aliança das Civilizações.\\n\\nCorrendo o risco de alguma falta de isenção, permito-me, aliás, felicitar a decisão de realizar este Fórum no meu país e no belo município de Cascais.\\n\\nPortugal é um país que compreende bem o valor da aproximação e do entendimento entre diferentes culturas e civilizações.\\n\\nSaúdo a presença de Sua Majestade o Rei Filipe VI de Espanha e o sinal de empenho na Aliança das Civilizações que a mesma presença representa.

This climate of hostility is characterized by systemic discrimination, violent assaults, and state-sanctioned actions against Muslim communities.\\n\\nRecently, Muslim victims have urged the Indian Supreme Court to intervene against the arbitrary demolition of properties owned by Muslims, a practice dubbed \"Bulldozer Justice\" that targets alleged illegal structures under the pretext of urban development. This trend reflects a broader pattern of violence and discrimination including the recent sentencing of Muslim converts under anti-conversion laws which stifles their religious freedom and autonomy.\\n\\nExperts from the third ministerial conference of Justice for All (JFA) have warned that rising Islamophobia could lead to genocide against Muslims in India. This sentiment is echoed in various protests such as those against housing for Muslim single mothers which reveal deep rooted institutionalized bigotry within Modi\\'s regime. The violent assaults on Muslims during Ramadan prayers at Gujarat University further illustrate their vulnerability in a country that claims to uphold secular values.\\n\\nIn Gujarat, Muslims face exclusion from housing in Hindu dominated areas, perpetuating a form of modern-day apartheid. The Indian government has suppressed dissenting voices from religious minorities through surveillance and harassment, often utilizing laws like the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) to stifle advocacy efforts. High profile BJP member Gyan Dev Ahuja have incited violence against Muslims by calling for the killing of anyone involved in slaughter of cow, which exacerbated communal tensions across states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\nViolent assaults on Muslims during Ramadan prayers at Gujarat University illustrate their vulnerability in a country that claims to uphold secular values.\\n\\nRenowned Bollywood actor turned BJP leader Mithun Chakraborty made ferocious statements cum threats against Muslims. He made a statement against a Muslim TMC leader stating \"If you throw in the Bhagirathi, we will also one day... not in the Bhagirathi because it is our mother... but we will bury you on the other side. Aap hamare jhaad ka ek fal todoge toh hum aapke jhaad ka char fal tod denge\"\\n\\nFurther he stated, \"In 2026 (the next Assembly elections), the masnad (throne) will be ours (the BJP\\'s) and we will do everything to achieve the goal... Kuch bhi karenge, kuch bhi. Main Home Minister sahab ke saamne bol raha hoon. Kuch bhi ke andar bahut sara matlab chupa hua hai\"\\n\\nRecent reports indicate a troubling rise in hate speech incidents against Muslims in India, particularly linked to the ruling Baharatiya Janata Party (BJP). A report by Hindutva Watch documented 255 incidents of hate speech targeting Muslims with approximately 80 percent of these incidents occurring in states governed by the BJP during the first half of 2023. A significant portion of documented hate speech incidents, approximately one-third, has been attributed to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and the Bajrang Dal.\\n\\nCIA has categorized both these groups as \"religious militant organizations\". Both VHP & Bajran Dal are linked to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) which serves as the ideological foundation for the Baharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This alarming situation highlights a significant trend in the politicization of communal tensions under Modi\\'s administration which has been criticized for fostering an environment where such rhetoric is increasingly normalized. Later on, BJP government has blocked platforms tracking hate crimes like Hindutva Watch and India Hate Lab under controversial IT act, 2000.\\n\\nSocial media plays a significant role in fueling Islamophobia with platforms facilitating the spread of hate speech and disinformation. Reports indicate that nearly two anti-Muslim hate speech incidents occur daily, with many linked to political campaigns led by the BJP. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) further marginalize Muslims by putting hundreds of thousands at risk of statelessness, particularly in Assam.\\n\\nThe destruction of property in predominantly Muslim neighborhoods has intensified under BJP rule, contributing to increased religious tensions. Civil society organizations have approached the Supreme Court to halt these demolitions and protect minority rights.\\n\\nThe international community is urged to demand action against rising Islamophobia and advocate for protective measures for minority communities in India. Furthermore, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) must organize campaigns addressing housing discrimination against Muslim single mothers and promote inclusive policies. World governing bodies should compel the Indian government to ensure protection for minorities during religious observances.\\n\\nThe plight of Muslim women illustrates an intersection of gender and religious discrimination as they face harassment at both local and state levels. The ongoing violence not only threatens their safety but also fuels existing inequalities within society.\\n\\nIn short, Islamophobia in India manifests through systemic discrimination, violent acts against Muslims, and state-supported initiatives that undermine their rights. The urgent need for civil society mobilization against discriminatory laws like the CAA and NRC is paramount to safeguarding citizenship rights for Muslims. As tensions rise, it is crucial for both domestic and international actors to advocate for justice and equality for all religious communities in India.'}, {'topic': 'Religion Prayer', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech in religious communities', 'title': 'CJP files five complaints to Maharashtra State Election Commission, demands FIRs for MCC violation against hate offenders | SabrangIndia', 'url': 'https://sabrangindia.in/cjp-files-five-complaints-to-maharashtra-state-election-commission-demands-firs-for-mcc-violation-against-hate-offenders/', 'published_date': '2024-12-03T05:00:02Z', 'source': 'SabrangIndia', 'content': 'CJP Takes a Stand Against Hate: five complaints filed for MCC Violations across Maharashtra, demanding FIRs against Suresh Chavhanke, Harsha Thakur, and BJP MP Dhananjay Mahadik, for allegedly delivering anti-Muslim hate speech during the MCC period\\n\\nCitizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) has filed five complaints with the Maharashtra State Election Commission, alleging violations of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) in Kolhapur, Jalgaon, Pathanpura, Akola, and Delgur (Nanded). The complaints highlight hate speech delivered by habitual hate offenders during the election period, urging the Chief Election Officer (CEO) S. Chockalingam to direct registration of FIRs under Sections 123(2), 123(3), and 123(3A) of the Representation of People\\'s Act, 1951. Three of the complaints were filed against Suresh Chavhanke, the editor-in-chief of Sudarshan News, for his inflammatory speeches in Jalgaon (Nov 8), Akola (Nov 13), and Pathanpura (Nov 11). Another complaint accuses Harsha Thakur of making divisive comments in Delgur (Nanded) on October 29, while the fifth complaint involves BJP Rajya Sabha MP Dhananjay Mahadik for his communal speech during an election rally in Kolhapur. These actions, CJP claims, violated MCC guidelines and electoral laws.\\n\\nOn November 15, 2024, CJP filed a complaint before the CEO Maharashtra regarding the gross violation of MCC in Jalgaon, Maharashtra, due to the hate-filled rhetoric of Suresh Chavhanke. Chavhanke\\'s speech at the Janata-NRC event blatantly violated the MCC and undermined the principles of free and fair elections as pleaded by the CJP in its complaint. The said speech was delivered by Suresh Chavhanke at the Janta-NRC event on November 8, 2024, in Jalgaon, Maharashtra.\\n\\nIn his address, Chavhanke explicitly targeted Muslim citizens by misrepresenting Islamic symbols, falsely claiming that the crescent and star, often associated with Islam, belonged not to Islam but to the Muslim League, and linking it to the creation of Pakistan. He further propagated misinformation by associating the true Islamic flag with extremist ideologies. Referring to Muslims as \"infiltrators\" and calling for their removal to \"save Maharashtra,\" he sought to fuel communal tensions. Additionally, he promoted the baseless \"Vote Jihad\" conspiracy, accusing Muslims of using elections to wage a religious war, inciting division and hostility.\\n\\nCJP mentioned in its complaint that \"This statement is highly provocative and anti-Muslim because it labels Muslims as \"infiltrators\" and associates them with a threat to India\\'s integrity. The call to \"drive out the infiltrators\" implies that Muslims are unwelcome outsiders, fostering fear and hatred. The comparison of the saffron flag to the Tricolor and the assertion that without saffron, the Tricolor will \"turn green\" insinuates that Muslims, symbolized by green, pose a threat to national unity. Furthermore, the term \"vote Jihad\" equates Muslim political participation to religious warfare, encouraging communal hostility and framing elections as a religious battle, thus deepening divisions.\\n\\nThe video can be accessed through this link: https: https://t.me/hindutvawatchin/802\\n\\n2.

Pathanpura (Mangrulpir) [November 11, 2024]\\n\\nSpeaker - Suresh Chavhanke\\n\\nOn November 21, 2024, CJP filed a complaint regarding the hate-filled speeches delivered by Suresh Chavhanke, editor-in-chief of Sudarshan News, in Akola and Pathanpura (Mangrulpir), Maharashtra. Chavhanke\\'s speeches, delivered on November 13, 2024, in Akola and November 11, 2024, in Pathanpura, contained clear examples of hate speech, particularly targeting the Muslim community. Throughout his speeches, Chavhanke used derogatory terms like \"love jihad,\" \"intruders,\" and \"jihadists,\" portraying Muslims as a threat to national security and fueling fear by labeling them as \"infiltrators\" from neighboring countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Myanmar.\\n\\nFurthermore, Chavhanke invoked historical figures such as \"Aurangzeb\" and \"Tipu Sultan\" to vilify Muslims, manipulating religious sentiments to create division. He also urged voters to support laws targeting Muslims, including \"cow protection\" and the baseless \"love jihad\" conspiracy. This inflammatory rhetoric was designed to incite hatred and polarize communities. CJP\\'s complaint highlighted that Chavhanke\\'s speeches violated the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) and sections 123(2), 123(3), and 123(3A) of the Representation of the People Act (RP Act), 1951, which prohibit hate speech and the incitement of religious division during election periods, as per CJP\\'s complaint.\\n\\nCJP said in its complaint that, \"By linking political choices to religious identity and inciting voters to act against Muslim communities, the speaker attempts to polarize the election along religious lines. The call to vote based on laws like \"love jihad\" or \"cow protection\" further encourages discrimination, suggesting that the Muslim community is responsible for crimes against Hindu women or society. This creates a hostile, divisive atmosphere, undermining the principles of free and fair elections.\"\\n\\nOn November 21, 2024, CJP filed a complaint regarding the anti-Muslim and communal hate speech delivered by right-wing leader Harsha Thakur at a public event in Delgur, Nanded, Maharashtra. Thakur, campaigning for independent Hindu nationalist candidate Dr. Virupaksha Maharaj, made inflammatory remarks that blatantly violated the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) and undermined free and fair elections. On October 29, 2024, Thakur\\'s speech contained divisive rhetoric, calling for Hindus to avoid supporting those who allegedly sided with other religious communities.\\n\\nShe warned that if Sharia law were implemented, valuable land would be transferred to the Waqf Board, inciting fear and communal tension. Thakur further urged voters to prioritize religious unity over caste-based voting. Her comments, intended to stoke division, violated MCC provisions by inciting religious hatred and manipulating religious sentiments for electoral gain. CJP emphasized that these statements contravened Sections 123(2), 123(3), and 123(3A) of the Representation of the People Act (RP Act), 1951.\\n\\nAccording to CJP\\'s complaint in her speech, Thakur urged voters that, \"Don\\'t vote for a candidate who gives employment to Muslims!\" and further stated, \"India will never work on Sharia law,\" while also spreading unfounded fears about the Waqf Board. This rhetoric is not only inflammatory but also divisive, promoting religious intolerance and fear-mongering. By appealing to voters on religious lines and stoking fear about Muslims and their institutions, Thakur\\'s speech creates a dangerous environment of communal polarization.\"\\n\\nThe video can be accessed through this link: https: https://t.me/hindutvawatchin/825\\n\\nOn November 15, 2024, CJP approached the CEO Maharashtra with a complaint against BJP Rajya Sabha MP Dhananjay Mahadik, following his controversial remarks at a rally in Kolhapur, Maharashtra. In a video that surfaced, Mahadik was seen instructing party workers to target women beneficiaries of the Ladki Bahini Yojana attending Congress rallies. He directed his supporters to photograph or film these women and report back to him. His statement, \"I will teach those women a lesson,\" was a clear attempt to intimidate and surveil women based on their political affiliations. These actions were seen as an explicit violation of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) and the Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1951.\\n\\nCJP argued that Mahadik\\'s directive not only threatened women\\'s rights to political participation but also used a government welfare scheme intended for empowerment as a tool for political control. The complaint called for immediate action under electoral laws to address this form of intimidation.\\n\\nThe video can be accessed through this link: https://x.com/HateDetectors/status/1856274208646672512\\n\\nNotably, CJP played a pivotal role in monitoring the assembly elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, vigilantly flagging complaints of hate speech and violations of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC).

CJP\\'s complaint highlighted how the speech violated the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) by inciting religious hatred and political division.

The CJP complaint highlighted that Chavhanke\\'s speech, laden with Islamophobic and divisive content, not only violated ethical standards of political discourse but also breached the MCC, which governs the conduct of political leaders during the election period.\\n\\nIn the speech, Chavhanke allegedly claimed that Europe would soon cease to exist due to a Muslim takeover, making inflammatory statements about the growing Muslim population in India. He further propagated the debunked \"love jihad\" conspiracy theory and stated that India was at risk from \"10 crore infiltrators,\" referring to Muslims as a threat to Hindu culture and suggesting that they should be expelled from the country. These remarks, according to the CJP, were designed to create fear, manipulate public sentiment, and divide communities along religious lines.\\n\\nCJP\\'s complaint, while condemning the hate speech, also referenced a recent FIR filed in Thane against another individual, Kajal Hindustani, for delivering a similar hate speech.\\n\\nKey Allegations in the Speech\\n\\nThe complaint provides an in-depth analysis of Chavhanke\\'s speech, citing several excerpts that they argued violated the legal framework meant to ensure a fair and peaceful election process. The speech, according to the complaint, sought to create a sense of insecurity among Hindus by presenting Muslims as a demographic threat, manipulating fears about rising Muslim populations, and linking this to supposed threats like \"Love Jihad\" and \"Land Jihad.\"\\n\\nOne of the most controversial claims made by Chavhanke was the assertion that India faced a crisis of \"infiltrators,\" with an estimated 10 crore illegal Muslim immigrants in the country. He further suggested that the growing Muslim population would soon make Hindus a minority in several states by 2048. His remarks regarding Muslims being an \"economic burden\" on the nation and his demand for their expulsion were, according to the CJP, an incitement to religious hatred.\\n\\nChavhnake said in his speech that, \"There are 10 crore intruders sitting in India. 1 crore in Maharashtra. 40 lakhs in Mumbai. 3.5 lakhs in your district. Infiltrators, those who came into the country without permission. Illegal citizens. Get this illegal citizen out now. Is it legal to say so or not? Is it morally right or not? Practical or not?

Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC) recently held in Cascais, Portugal, Additional Foreign Secretary, Imran Ahmed Siddiqui, reaffirmed Pakistan\\'s \"unwavering commitment\" to combating this scourage, according to a press release issued in NewYork on Tuesday.\\n\\nAt the same time, he reiterated Pakistan\\'s deep concern over the continued rise of Islamophobia, as manifested in the continued desecration of religious symbols, demolition of mosques and other Islamic religious and heritage sites, hate speech and disturbing attacks on Muslims, \"particularly in the territories under foreign occupation\".\\n\\nThe UN Alliance of Civilizations was established in 2005 to galvanize international action against extremism through fostering of international, intercultural and interreligious dialogue and cooperation.\\n\\nThe Alliance benefits from a political support of the Group of Friends, a community of countries and international organizations which actively promotes its objectives and work at the global, regional and local levels, as well as worldwide. The Group is a driving force of UNAOC and plays a vital role in its strategic planning and implementation process.\\n\\nThe group currently includes 153 members, with 124 UN member states, 1 non-member state, and 28 international organizations, representing all continents, societies and cultures.\\n\\nIn his remarks, Imran Siddiqui said commended the Alliance\\'s contributions over the past two decades in fostering dialogue and mutual respect among religions.\\n\\nAs regards Islamophobia, he cited Pakistan\\'s leadership in tabling two General Assembly resolutions on behalf of the OIC on the subject, with the most recent resolution, adopted in March 2024, calling for the appointment of a UN Special Envoy on Islamophobia.\\n\\nA Global Conference on safeguarding religious sites was also held on the margins of the Forum, where Pakistan highlighted the alarming trend of deliberate attacks on mosques, often carried out with impunity and state sanction, the press release said. In this regard, Pakistan urged the UNAOC to prioritize the protection of mosques and other Islamic religious and heritage sites that are at immediate risk of destruction in the mapping of religious sites under the 2019 Action Plan for safeguarding of the religious site.\\n\\nMeanwhile, world leaders attending the forum adopted a bold, forward-looking declaration to advance peace as war rages on, from Gaza and Lebanon to Sudan and Ukraine.\\n\\nHarnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and combatting hate speech and mis- and disinformation are part of the plan to bolster peace and mutual understanding as Heads of State and Government, including kings, presidents and prime ministers from Cabo Verde, Senegal and Spain, unanimously adopted the Cascais Declaration.\\n\\nNamed for the city hosting the UN Alliance for Civilizations 10th Global Forum from 25 to 27 November, the declaration outlines a range of actions and focuses on solutions to a current landscape of eroding trust and rising antisemitism, nationalism and online hate.\\n\\n\"These are very difficult times,\" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the forum\\'s opening session. \"In such a scenario, we need peace\" now, in Gaza, Lebanon, Sudan and Ukraine and beyond.\\n\\nThe adoption of the declaration is the centre-piece of the 10th Global Forum, which included a dynamic youth forum and film festival on Monday, its Intercultural Innovation Hub ceremony on Tuesday and vibrant panels throughout, tackling current challenges, from a spike in antisemitism to the power of young people.\\n\\n\"We need voices and actions across all levels,\" including in communities, online and across cultures and institutions, using all tools available, Guterres said.\\n\\nThe 25-paragraph declaration spotlighted a set of innovative actions and keys to unleashing this badly needed peace. It noted the potential use of AI as a tool to advance intercultural and inter-religious dialogue and stressed the importance of combatting disinformation, misinformation and hate speech while strengthening information integrity.\\n\\nThe Cascais Declaration also stressed the importance of intergenerational dialogue for peace, sustainable development and human rights; noted the contribution of \"sports diplomacy\" as a tool for promoting dialogue and emphasized the need to support and strengthen the role of women as negotiators, mediators and peacemakers.\\n\\nBy its provisions, world leaders and partners pledged to:\\n\\n-- Emphasise the need to combat all forms of religious intolerance;\\n\\n-- Acknowledge the central role of inclusive, quality and transformative education in promoting dialogue, peace and human rights;\\n\\n-- Recognise the role that religious leaders can play in conflict mediation and development cooperation;\\n\\n-- Underline the positive impact that safe, orderly and regular migration can have on countries of origin and destination, including through promoting cultural pluralism and encourage the creative vision of young people to prevent xenophobia and highlight positive narratives about cultural diversity, social inclusion and mobility, and,\\n\\n-- Take note of the adoption of the Pact for the Future, which recognizes the role of reinvigorated multilateralism and the importance of the voice of religious leaders and faith-based organizations in promoting a culture of peace\\n\\nAhead of the declaration\\'s adoption, the UN chief and world leaders took the floor, including Prime Minister Aminata Touré of Senegal, who drew attention to the ongoing devastating war in Gaza.\\n\\n\"As we witness what is happening in Gaza, with more than 42,000 victims, mostly civilians, what does civilization mean in such context?\" she asked. \"Is civilization about \\'you kill one of mine, I\\'ll kill 34.16 of yours,\\' which is, so far, the retaliation rate of Israel against the unacceptable, widely condemned attacks of October 2023. Don\\'t the unbearable scenes we see on television make any discussion on civilization look out of touch?\"\\n\\nShe said there is no other way to deal with civilization than discussion based on equal rights embedded in the UN Charter and international framework.\\n\\nKing Don Felipe VI of Spain told delegates that \"in the 21st century, diplomacy is a tool of peace, but its traditional tools are outdated and must be supplemented with new spheres of action, more boldness, creativity and pragmatism.\"\\n\\n\"We must raise our vision to more deeply understand what unites us,\" King Don Felipe VI said. \"The Alliance of Civilizations is the implementation of what is known as the diplomacy of values, tearing down walls and building bridges,\" he added. \"Our actions must go beyond conference rooms, to school, places where people gather and the marketplace.\"\\n\\nIn this regard, he said, social media is potential as a catalyst in this regard, he said, pointing to the Alliance\\'s Youth Solidarity Fund, which was featured on day one of the 10th Global Forum.\\n\\nStill, a great deal more needs to be done, he said. At a time when dehumanisation is a growing problem, he emphasised that efforts must aim at eliminating stereotypes and ensuring that the wealth of human diversity is beneficial for everyone.\\n\\nIn a similar vein, UN Secretary-General Guterres said that the absence of peace is leading to an erosion of trust, making the Alliance of Civilizations\\'s work more important than ever before.\\n\\n\"Rebuilding trust is our essential task,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Hate-filled frenzies are perpetuating stereotypes and misconceptions,\" the UN chief said.

At the conference, Emilie Kao, the group\\'s senior counsel and vice president of advocacy strategy, took the floor to express her outrage that a Finnish doctor was put on trial for referring to homosexuality as \"a developmental disorder,\" \"a shame and a sin\" and as a form of \"genetic degeneration.\"\\n\\n\"Thank God she was unanimously acquitted,\" said Kao.\\n\\nAustin Ruse, president of the Center for Family and Human Rights (otherwise known as C-Fam), who has supported laws that would criminalise homosexual behaviour and has also said that hard left people that run modern universities should be \"taken out and shot,\" spoke about some of his group\\'s recent accomplishments. \"There is no redefinition of the family because we stopped them. Sexual orientation and gender identity has never become a category of nondiscrimination in international law, because we have stopped them,\" he said.\\n\\nKao, C-Fam and ADF did not respond to requests for comment. Ruse disputed that he called for the criminalization of gay sex, saying that he was only offering \"a hypothetical.\" He added that he has \"never advocated that anyone be taken out and shot.\"\\n\\nThe access and influence of these anti-LGBTQIA+ groups inside the UN isn\\'t limited to this summit. Both hold what\\'s known as Special Consultative status at the UN. And they\\'re not the only ones.\\n\\nIn a months-long investigation, Uncloseted Media found that at least six Southern Poverty Law Center-designated anti-LGBTQIA+ hate groups hold this coveted status, which is granted by the UN\\'s Economic and Social Council.\\n\\n\"What\\'s astounding is I\\'m not sure anybody\\'s ever produced a list,\" says Heidi Beirich, who oversaw SPLC\\'s annual designation of hate groups from 2012 to 2019. \"These organisations have been stealthily inserting themselves into bodies whose beliefs they don\\'t share for years,\" she says.\\n\\n\"Many of these organisations don\\'t even believe in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\" she says.\\n\\nSpecial Consultative Status -- which is held by more than 5000 groups -- gives members unique access to the UN and its subsidiary bodies, to the various human rights mechanisms of the organisation and to special events organised by the President of the General Assembly.\\n\\nThe UN did not respond to repeated interview requests as well as requests for comment.\\n\\n\"You have access to member states, right? So I think the danger of all of this is access to the members who make decisions on resolutions. Who make UN policy,\" says Gillian Kane, director of global policy and research at Ipas, a non-governmental organisation that focuses on advancing gender equity and reducing the harm of U.S. foreign policy.\\n\\nKane, who attended the November Summit, says this status \"legitimises these groups\" who have clear track records that conflict with the core principles of the UN, like the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing subtle about what they do. They hate gays and they\\'re unapologetic to go after it,\" says Kane.\\n\\nMany of these groups have been around for decades, advocating against the LGBTQIA+ community. Kao\\'s group, ADF, published a press release titled \"ADF increases global impact with new status at United Nations\" when they were granted consultative status in 2010. \"ADF can now have a say when UN treaties and conventions are drafted that directly impact religious liberty and important matters related to the sanctity of life, marriage, and the family,\" the release said. It goes on to say that \"ADF will now be able to monitor and provide input on matters\" affecting religious freedoms.\\n\\nThe group, which consists of hundreds of lawyers in the U.S. and around the globe, was founded in 1994 by Alan Sears, who co-authored The Homosexual Agenda: Exposing the Principal Threat to Religious Freedom Today. Since then, they have advocated at the state and federal level for laws that promote conversion therapy and that would ban gays from serving in the military. In addition, they\\'ve testified in favour of laws that would strip transgender folks of the right to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity, that would prevent them from changing the name on their birth certificate and that would ban their access to gender affirming healthcare.\\n\\nIn addition, they have been effective globally through their international arm, ADF International. In 2012 in Jamaica, they advocated for the retention of a a law that criminalises gay sex. That law remains in effect. And in 2013, members of ADF worked to defend a Belize statute that makes anyone engaging in LGBTQIA+ sex subject to a punishment of up to 10 years in prison.\\n\\nThe other groups -- which include the Howard Center for Family Religion and Society (now known as International Organization for Family), Family Research Council, the Association of United Families International and the American Family Association of New York -- all have similar track records.\\n\\nSubscribe now\\n\\nFamily Research Council has advocated in favor of conversion therapy laws and continues to publish articles that falsely assert that \"sexual orientation change efforts\" are effective for gay people. And Tim Wildmon, the President of the American Family Association, is currently advocating for a boycott of Target for allowing trans people to use the bathroom or dressing room that matches their gender identity.\\n\\n\"Please use #BoycottTarget,\" Wildmon wrote in a special update on their website.\\n\\nBecause of these track records, Beirich felt it was \"a no brainer\" to add them to the SPLC\\'s list of hate groups alongside the Ku Klux Klan, the American Defense Skinheads and Aryan Nations.\\n\\n\"We put them on the hate list because they demonise the entire LGBTQIA+ population in derogatory, dehumanising language, just like the Klan would with Black people or Jewish people,\" says Beirich, now the co-founder and chief strategy officer at the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.\\n\\n\"People in the Christian right who have long demonised the LGBTQIA+ community have political power in this country, and it\\'s more normalised to hate queer people than to hate Black people for no damn good reason. Which is what we\\'re talking about. So it\\'s the biblically informed aspect of it that somehow legitimises it,\" says Beirich, who adds that she has \"absolutely no idea\" how these groups secured this status.\\n\\nSo how do these groups get here? While they all conform to basic principles required for Special Consultative Status, such as being a registered nonprofit and having specialised expertise on issues relevant to the UN, they are also expected to act in conformity with \"the spirit, purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,\" which specifically states that members must promote and encourage respect for human rights, take action \"to strengthen universal peace\" and -- specifically for members with consultative status -- must promote policies that encourage \"social progress.\"\\n\\nNeil Datta, the executive director for the European Parliamentary Forum for Sexual and Reproductive Rights, says part of the reason these groups are granted this status is due to overworked civil servants who work for the NGO Branch of the UN and are in charge of a preliminary screening of these applicants.\\n\\n\"The folks reviewing these applications are not necessarily thematic experts on anything. So they\\'re tasked with a very dry job of processing different applications that come in, and very legitimately won\\'t know what all of these different groups are,\" he says. \"Imagine you had 15 climate groups applying and one didn\\'t believe in climate change. It\\'s not necessarily that easy to understand.\"\\n\\nDatta says it can be even harder to identify anti-LGBTQIA+ groups because they often operate under the guise of protecting the family or the rights of the child.\\n\\n\"These groups have very nice names that aren\\'t obviously anti-LGBTQIA+. And so the people reviewing these applications may not be able to pick up on some of the subtleties,\" he says.\\n\\nIn addition, Datta says these groups use \"very clever vocabulary\" that sounds well meaning. But really, they are weaponising this language to penetrate powerful institutions like the UN \"In reality, they\\'re using religious freedom as a fig leaf for hate speech.\"\\n\\n\"But if you know your Catholic social doctrine, then you will recognise [this vocabulary] immediately.\" Datta says common dog whistles such as \"common good\" or \"human dignity\" and \"in favour of life [or] of the family\" are used almost exclusively to limit the human rights of others, \"usually in sexuality and reproduction.\"\\n\\nDatta says these \"codewords\" are another reason these groups go unnoticed within the UN. For example, during a three hour meeting at the November Transatlantic Summit event, participants used the term \"human dignity\" over 30 times.\\n\\nAfter they get through the preliminary screening by UN civil servants, their application is reviewed by the NGO Committee -- which meets twice a year -- to decide who they will recommend for Special Consultative Status. After review, the recommended organisations are presented to ECOSOC for their final decision.\\n\\nThis committee includes 19 countries, including multiple countries that have extremely hostile policies against LGBTQIA+ people, like Algeria, where homosexual activity is punishable by up to two years in prison; and Eritrea, where homosexuality is illegal and can be punished with jail-time.\\n\\n\"It honestly depends on who\\'s sitting on that committee. So if you have countries that already have anti-LGBTQIA+ policies in place, they\\'re going to be friendly to inviting these groups in and approving their status,\" says Kane.\\n\\nOnce these groups officially gain this status, they use religious freedom as a justification for promoting policies and laws that limit the rights of LGBTQIA+ people through the UN apparatus.\\n\\nThe UN Declaration of Human Rights does not yet explicitly protect folks who are discriminated against for their sexual orientation or gender identity. This lack of protection has given anti-LGBTQIA+ groups leverage in their arguments to roll back the rights of LGBTQIA+ folks.\\n\\nInside the UN, there are efforts to change this. For example, in 2019 the Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect published a Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech that outlines what constitutes hate speech and how to combat it. In it, they describe hate speech \"as any kind of communication in speech, writing or behaviour, that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender or other identity factor.\"\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, this new guidance is opposed by the anti-LGBTQIA+ hate groups. At the Political Network for Values Transatlantic Summit in November, ADF\\'s Kao said current hate speech laws protect too many different groups of people and in doing so infringe on religious freedom laws. \"Who can possibly know what would fall under such an expansive definition of hate?\" she said. \"These laws give a veto to any offended person, allowing them to censor their neighbours.\"\\n\\nBeirich strongly disagrees. \"You can\\'t use religion as a foil for harming communities and tearing into their civil and human rights. I don\\'t care,\" she says, adding that the Ku Klux Klan has weaponised religion as a means to discriminate against Black people since it was founded in 1865.\\n\\n\"It\\'s one thing to live your life however you want to live it biblically inspired. It\\'s a different thing to have that affect other people,\" says Beirich. \"Keep your views to yourself.\"\\n\\nAs these groups continue to operate inside the UN, what can be done? Datta says NGOs applying for Special Consultative Status should be subject to more rigorous background checks, where an independent body thoroughly examines the track record of applicants.\\n\\n\"What are the positions...of these organisations and what have they actually done?\" says Datta. \"What other things have they done which could be seen as having undermined human rights -- the UN\\'s Declaration of Human Rights?\"\\n\\nHe says using an independent body for this review would reduce the potential of political influences in the decision-making process.\\n\\nAs for those who already have Special Consultative Status, their status can be revoked if they don\\'t \"conform at all times to the principles governing the establishment.\"\\n\\nBeirich feels strongly that should happen swiftly for all six anti-LGBTQIA+ groups that currently hold this status. \"The United Nations should revoke the consultative status of people who stand opposed to the Universal Declaration. It shouldn\\'t stand for policies that are rolling back human rights -- it\\'s absurd.\"'}], [{'topic': 'Religion Values', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech and religion values', 'title': \"Dharm Sansad: Hindu Religious leaders condemn 'divisive' event even as a contempt petition is filed in SC | SabrangIndia\", 'url': 'https://sabrangindia.in/dharm-sansad-hindu-religious-leaders-condemn-divisive-event-even-as-a-contempt-petition-is-filed-in-sc/', 'published_date': '2024-12-17T08:24:26Z', 'source': 'SabrangIndia', 'content': 'A contempt petition filed in the SC as well as a collective stance from religious leaders seek to hold authorities accountable for allowing the \"Dharam Sansad\" to proceed unchecked, which threatens public harmony and violates constitutional principles of unity and peace.\\n\\nOn December 16, 2024, a contempt petition had been filed to bring to the Supreme Court\\'s attention the failure of authorities in Uttar Pradesh to stop an upcoming event called the \"Dharam Sansad\". The said event, scheduled to take place from December 17 to 21, 2024 in Ghaziabad, is being organised by individuals who have a history of making hateful and inflammatory speeches against the Muslim community. The petition highlights that these speeches and the event itself promote hatred and could lead to communal violence.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court had earlier directed authorities to take immediate action against such hate speeches and events, even if no formal complaint was made. However, despite clear announcements about the \"Dharam Sansad\" and its harmful content being shared publicly, the authorities have failed to act. This petition calls for the Court to intervene and ensure that the law is enforced, so as to prevent any further spread of hate and violence.\\n\\nNot only through legal means, many religious organisations have also condemned the scheduled event. The Satya Dharam Samvad (SDS), a collective of 62 prominent Hindu Acharyas, has also spoken against the divisive nature of the proposed \"Dharam Sansad,\" calling for its rejection and emphasising the need for unity, tolerance, and interfaith dialogue. In a statement, they expressed concern over the misuse of religion to incite hatred and violence, reaffirming that Hinduism, with its core principles of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family) and Sarva Dharma Sambhava (equal respect for all religions), stands for peace, acceptance, and harmony.\\n\\nSatya Dharam Samvad condemns the \"Dharam Sansad\" and calls for unity\\n\\nThe Satya Dharam Samvad (SDS), an organisation of Hindu Acharyas, has called upon Hindu religious leaders and organisations to reject the divisive \"Dharam Sansad\" proposed by the Yati Narsinghanand Foundation, scheduled to take place from Tuesday to Saturday at the Shiv-Shakti temple complex in Ghaziabad\\'s Dasna. In a joint statement signed by 62 Acharyas, including prominent figures like Swami Raghavendra, Acharya Bajrang, Mahant, Prof. Anantanand Rambachan, Ashok Maharaj Kamble, and Ashok Sangpa, the SDS emphasised the importance of promoting unity, tolerance, and dialogue over hatred and division.\\n\\nThe statement expressed deep concern over the increasing misuse of religion to spread violence and discord, urging a return to the foundational values of Hinduism - Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family) and Sarva Dharma Sambhava (equal respect for all religions). It affirmed that Hinduism has always stood for peace, acceptance, and harmony, rejecting caste-based divisions and any form of oppression. True spirituality, the signatories asserted, lies in recognising the divine presence in all beings and fostering mutual respect.\\n\\nThe SDS also criticised the \"World Religion Convention\" and the provocative speeches targeting specific faiths that are being promoted as part of the upcoming event. These actions, they argued, are a departure from the true essence of Sanatan Dharma, undermining its spiritual sanctity while threatening the harmony of the nation. The statement firmly condemned words or actions that promote hatred, disrespect other religions, or incite violence, calling such behaviour completely at odds with Hindu principles.\\n\\nCalling for interfaith understanding and peaceful coexistence, the SDS urged religious leaders to oppose the exploitation of religion for political or divisive purposes. They also called on the authorities to take accountability and ensure that religion is not misused to fuel division. The signatories appealed for unity, urging Hindus and people of all faiths to come together with kindness and mutual respect, recognising that India\\'s true strength lies in its diversity and shared harmony.\\n\\nBackground: The petition had been filed before the Supreme Court of India under Article 129 of the Constitution, read with Section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. The petition arises from the deliberate and wilful disobedience of two specific orders passed by the Supreme Court: the order dated October 21, 2022 in Shaheen Abdulla v. Union of India & Ors. (W.P. (C) No. 940/2022) and the order dated April 28, 2023 in Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay v. Union of India & Ors. (W.P. (C) No. 943/2021). These orders had directed state authorities to take suo- motu action against hate speech or activities that attract offences under Sections 153A, 153B, 295A, and 505 of the erstwhile Indian Penal Code (IPC), even in the absence of formal complaints. The orders further clarified that any hesitation or delay in complying with these directions would amount to contempt of court.\\n\\nThe petition states that despite these explicit directives, the petition highlights that the authorities in Uttar Pradesh, including the Commissioner of Police, District Magistrate, and Director General of Police, have failed to act against an upcoming event titled \"Dharam Sansad,\" scheduled to take place from December 17 to 21 at Shiv Shakti Dham, Dasna, Ghaziabad. The event, organised by the Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati Foundation, has been widely publicised through a website titled worldreligiousconvention.org. The website and the event itself are rooted in incendiary, communal content that openly propagates hate against the Muslim community, posing a direct threat to constitutional values of secularism and fraternity. The contempt petition seeks immediate judicial intervention to prevent this event and hold the respondents accountable for their failure to comply with the Supreme Court\\'s earlier orders.\\n\\nThe content of the event and its communal nature: The petition brings to the Court\\'s attention the blatantly inflammatory and communal nature of the content being disseminated through the website promoting the \"Dharam Sansad\" event. The petition provides that the mission statement of the event openly declares:\\n\\n\"The World Religious Parliament is a meaningful initiative to warn the whole world about the danger of Islam and it is an effort to bring together every Non-Muslim of all over the countries.\"\\n\\nFurther, the petition also provides the vision statement that outlines an explicit and dangerous agenda:\\n\\n\"Our goal is to free the entire world from Islamic Jihad. This is our specific goal and to achieve this goal, we will take all possible steps.\"\\n\\nIn addition to the website\\'s content, the petition underscores that provocative and hateful language has been used in public speeches made by the event organisers, event as the announcement of the Dharam Sansad was being made. As per the petition, Yati Ramswaroopanand, one of the key figures associated with the event, delivered a speech in Dehradun on September 10, 2024, describing Muslims as \"not human\" and calling for Uttarakhand to be made \"Islam mukt.\" He further urged Hindus to \"keep good weapons and learn how to use them.\" The petition provides supporting material, including transcripts, screenshots, and reports, to substantiate these claims.\\n\\nThe petition emphasises that the dissemination of such incendiary content and the planned congregation of individuals with a documented history of hate speech is not only a violation of Sections 153A, 153B, 295A, and 505 of the IPC but also strikes at the core of India\\'s constitutional values of secularism, harmony, and fraternity.\\n\\nTrack record of violence and state inaction: The contempt petition goes beyond the immediate concern of the \"Dharam Sansad\" and highlights the troubling track record of the individuals involved in organising and promoting the event. Individuals like Yati Narsinghanand and Yati Ramswaroopanand have repeatedly made provocative speeches inciting communal violence. For instance:\\n\\nThe petition highlights that despite a well-documented history of hate speech and communal violence directly linked to these individuals, the state authorities have failed to take preventive action or register FIRs, as mandated by the Supreme Court. This consistent inaction emboldens the organisers and poses an imminent threat to communal harmony in the region.\\n\\nThe petition argues that the respondents\\' failure to act constitutes not just a dereliction of duty but a wilful disobedience of the Supreme Court\\'s orders. By ignoring repeated provocations and open announcements of such events, the state authorities are in clear contempt of court.\\n\\nLegal basis and prayer for relief: The petition places heavy reliance on two recent judgments of the Supreme Court to strengthen its legal argument. In Chaduranga Kanthraj URS v. P. Ravi Kumar (2024), the Court clarified that wilful disobedience -- deliberate and intentional disregard of court orders -- constitutes civil contempt. Similarly, in Celir LLP v. Sumati Prasad Bafna (2024), the Court expanded the scope of contempt, holding that any act intended to undermine the judicial process also falls within its ambit. The petition argues that the respondents\\' failure to prevent the \"Dharam Sansad\" event, despite its provocative and unconstitutional nature, directly undermines the Court\\'s authority and frustrates its earlier orders.\\n\\nThe petition concludes with the following prayers:\\n\\nThe petition emphasises that the Court\\'s intervention is not only necessary to address the specific case of non-compliance but also to reaffirm the rule of law and the constitutional mandate of secularism and fraternity. By allowing such events to proceed unchecked, the respondents are enabling the erosion of these values and endangering communal harmony across the nation.

At the conference, Emilie Kao, the group\\'s senior counsel and vice president of advocacy strategy, took the floor to express her outrage that a Finnish doctor was put on trial for referring to homosexuality as \"a developmental disorder,\" \"a shame and a sin\" and as a form of \"genetic degeneration.\"\\n\\n\"Thank God she was unanimously acquitted,\" said Kao.\\n\\nAustin Ruse, president of the Center for Family and Human Rights (otherwise known as C-Fam), who has supported laws that would criminalise homosexual behaviour and has also said that hard left people that run modern universities should be \"taken out and shot,\" spoke about some of his group\\'s recent accomplishments. \"There is no redefinition of the family because we stopped them. Sexual orientation and gender identity has never become a category of nondiscrimination in international law, because we have stopped them,\" he said.\\n\\nKao, C-Fam and ADF did not respond to requests for comment. Ruse disputed that he called for the criminalization of gay sex, saying that he was only offering \"a hypothetical.\" He added that he has \"never advocated that anyone be taken out and shot.\"\\n\\nThe access and influence of these anti-LGBTQIA+ groups inside the UN isn\\'t limited to this summit. Both hold what\\'s known as Special Consultative status at the UN. And they\\'re not the only ones.\\n\\nIn a months-long investigation, Uncloseted Media found that at least six Southern Poverty Law Center-designated anti-LGBTQIA+ hate groups hold this coveted status, which is granted by the UN\\'s Economic and Social Council.\\n\\n\"What\\'s astounding is I\\'m not sure anybody\\'s ever produced a list,\" says Heidi Beirich, who oversaw SPLC\\'s annual designation of hate groups from 2012 to 2019. \"These organisations have been stealthily inserting themselves into bodies whose beliefs they don\\'t share for years,\" she says.\\n\\n\"Many of these organisations don\\'t even believe in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\" she says.\\n\\nSpecial Consultative Status -- which is held by more than 5000 groups -- gives members unique access to the UN and its subsidiary bodies, to the various human rights mechanisms of the organisation and to special events organised by the President of the General Assembly.\\n\\nThe UN did not respond to repeated interview requests as well as requests for comment.\\n\\n\"You have access to member states, right? So I think the danger of all of this is access to the members who make decisions on resolutions. Who make UN policy,\" says Gillian Kane, director of global policy and research at Ipas, a non-governmental organisation that focuses on advancing gender equity and reducing the harm of U.S. foreign policy.\\n\\nKane, who attended the November Summit, says this status \"legitimises these groups\" who have clear track records that conflict with the core principles of the UN, like the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing subtle about what they do. They hate gays and they\\'re unapologetic to go after it,\" says Kane.\\n\\nMany of these groups have been around for decades, advocating against the LGBTQIA+ community. Kao\\'s group, ADF, published a press release titled \"ADF increases global impact with new status at United Nations\" when they were granted consultative status in 2010. \"ADF can now have a say when UN treaties and conventions are drafted that directly impact religious liberty and important matters related to the sanctity of life, marriage, and the family,\" the release said. It goes on to say that \"ADF will now be able to monitor and provide input on matters\" affecting religious freedoms.\\n\\nThe group, which consists of hundreds of lawyers in the U.S. and around the globe, was founded in 1994 by Alan Sears, who co-authored The Homosexual Agenda: Exposing the Principal Threat to Religious Freedom Today. Since then, they have advocated at the state and federal level for laws that promote conversion therapy and that would ban gays from serving in the military. In addition, they\\'ve testified in favour of laws that would strip transgender folks of the right to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity, that would prevent them from changing the name on their birth certificate and that would ban their access to gender affirming healthcare.\\n\\nIn addition, they have been effective globally through their international arm, ADF International. In 2012 in Jamaica, they advocated for the retention of a a law that criminalises gay sex. That law remains in effect. And in 2013, members of ADF worked to defend a Belize statute that makes anyone engaging in LGBTQIA+ sex subject to a punishment of up to 10 years in prison.\\n\\nThe other groups -- which include the Howard Center for Family Religion and Society (now known as International Organization for Family), Family Research Council, the Association of United Families International and the American Family Association of New York -- all have similar track records.\\n\\nSubscribe now\\n\\nFamily Research Council has advocated in favor of conversion therapy laws and continues to publish articles that falsely assert that \"sexual orientation change efforts\" are effective for gay people. And Tim Wildmon, the President of the American Family Association, is currently advocating for a boycott of Target for allowing trans people to use the bathroom or dressing room that matches their gender identity.\\n\\n\"Please use #BoycottTarget,\" Wildmon wrote in a special update on their website.\\n\\nBecause of these track records, Beirich felt it was \"a no brainer\" to add them to the SPLC\\'s list of hate groups alongside the Ku Klux Klan, the American Defense Skinheads and Aryan Nations.\\n\\n\"We put them on the hate list because they demonise the entire LGBTQIA+ population in derogatory, dehumanising language, just like the Klan would with Black people or Jewish people,\" says Beirich, now the co-founder and chief strategy officer at the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.\\n\\n\"People in the Christian right who have long demonised the LGBTQIA+ community have political power in this country, and it\\'s more normalised to hate queer people than to hate Black people for no damn good reason. Which is what we\\'re talking about. So it\\'s the biblically informed aspect of it that somehow legitimises it,\" says Beirich, who adds that she has \"absolutely no idea\" how these groups secured this status.\\n\\nSo how do these groups get here? While they all conform to basic principles required for Special Consultative Status, such as being a registered nonprofit and having specialised expertise on issues relevant to the UN, they are also expected to act in conformity with \"the spirit, purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,\" which specifically states that members must promote and encourage respect for human rights, take action \"to strengthen universal peace\" and -- specifically for members with consultative status -- must promote policies that encourage \"social progress.\"\\n\\nNeil Datta, the executive director for the European Parliamentary Forum for Sexual and Reproductive Rights, says part of the reason these groups are granted this status is due to overworked civil servants who work for the NGO Branch of the UN and are in charge of a preliminary screening of these applicants.\\n\\n\"The folks reviewing these applications are not necessarily thematic experts on anything. So they\\'re tasked with a very dry job of processing different applications that come in, and very legitimately won\\'t know what all of these different groups are,\" he says. \"Imagine you had 15 climate groups applying and one didn\\'t believe in climate change. It\\'s not necessarily that easy to understand.\"\\n\\nDatta says it can be even harder to identify anti-LGBTQIA+ groups because they often operate under the guise of protecting the family or the rights of the child.\\n\\n\"These groups have very nice names that aren\\'t obviously anti-LGBTQIA+. And so the people reviewing these applications may not be able to pick up on some of the subtleties,\" he says.\\n\\nIn addition, Datta says these groups use \"very clever vocabulary\" that sounds well meaning. But really, they are weaponising this language to penetrate powerful institutions like the UN \"In reality, they\\'re using religious freedom as a fig leaf for hate speech.\"\\n\\n\"But if you know your Catholic social doctrine, then you will recognise [this vocabulary] immediately.\" Datta says common dog whistles such as \"common good\" or \"human dignity\" and \"in favour of life [or] of the family\" are used almost exclusively to limit the human rights of others, \"usually in sexuality and reproduction.\"\\n\\nDatta says these \"codewords\" are another reason these groups go unnoticed within the UN. For example, during a three hour meeting at the November Transatlantic Summit event, participants used the term \"human dignity\" over 30 times.\\n\\nAfter they get through the preliminary screening by UN civil servants, their application is reviewed by the NGO Committee -- which meets twice a year -- to decide who they will recommend for Special Consultative Status. After review, the recommended organisations are presented to ECOSOC for their final decision.\\n\\nThis committee includes 19 countries, including multiple countries that have extremely hostile policies against LGBTQIA+ people, like Algeria, where homosexual activity is punishable by up to two years in prison; and Eritrea, where homosexuality is illegal and can be punished with jail-time.\\n\\n\"It honestly depends on who\\'s sitting on that committee. So if you have countries that already have anti-LGBTQIA+ policies in place, they\\'re going to be friendly to inviting these groups in and approving their status,\" says Kane.\\n\\nOnce these groups officially gain this status, they use religious freedom as a justification for promoting policies and laws that limit the rights of LGBTQIA+ people through the UN apparatus.\\n\\nThe UN Declaration of Human Rights does not yet explicitly protect folks who are discriminated against for their sexual orientation or gender identity. This lack of protection has given anti-LGBTQIA+ groups leverage in their arguments to roll back the rights of LGBTQIA+ folks.\\n\\nInside the UN, there are efforts to change this. For example, in 2019 the Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect published a Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech that outlines what constitutes hate speech and how to combat it. In it, they describe hate speech \"as any kind of communication in speech, writing or behaviour, that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender or other identity factor.\"\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, this new guidance is opposed by the anti-LGBTQIA+ hate groups. At the Political Network for Values Transatlantic Summit in November, ADF\\'s Kao said current hate speech laws protect too many different groups of people and in doing so infringe on religious freedom laws. \"Who can possibly know what would fall under such an expansive definition of hate?\" she said. \"These laws give a veto to any offended person, allowing them to censor their neighbours.\"\\n\\nBeirich strongly disagrees. \"You can\\'t use religion as a foil for harming communities and tearing into their civil and human rights. I don\\'t care,\" she says, adding that the Ku Klux Klan has weaponised religion as a means to discriminate against Black people since it was founded in 1865.\\n\\n\"It\\'s one thing to live your life however you want to live it biblically inspired. It\\'s a different thing to have that affect other people,\" says Beirich. \"Keep your views to yourself.\"\\n\\nAs these groups continue to operate inside the UN, what can be done? Datta says NGOs applying for Special Consultative Status should be subject to more rigorous background checks, where an independent body thoroughly examines the track record of applicants.\\n\\n\"What are the positions...of these organisations and what have they actually done?\" says Datta. \"What other things have they done which could be seen as having undermined human rights -- the UN\\'s Declaration of Human Rights?\"\\n\\nHe says using an independent body for this review would reduce the potential of political influences in the decision-making process.\\n\\nAs for those who already have Special Consultative Status, their status can be revoked if they don\\'t \"conform at all times to the principles governing the establishment.\"\\n\\nBeirich feels strongly that should happen swiftly for all six anti-LGBTQIA+ groups that currently hold this status. \"The United Nations should revoke the consultative status of people who stand opposed to the Universal Declaration. It shouldn\\'t stand for policies that are rolling back human rights -- it\\'s absurd.\"'}, {'topic': 'Religion Values', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech and religion values', 'title': 'Kant vs Tahir Ali: why desecration should not be outlawed - The Freethinker', 'url': 'https://freethinker.co.uk/2024/12/kant-vs-tahir-ali-why-desecration-should-not-be-outlawed/', 'published_date': '2024-12-06T07:16:14Z', 'source': 'The Freethinker', 'content': \"As readers of the Freethinker are likely aware, MP Tahir Ali recently advocated in Parliament for legislation prohibiting 'the desecration of religious texts and the prophets of the Abrahamic religions.' Although his call was made during Islamophobia Awareness Month and in a context of higher rates of anti-Muslim hate than at any other point in recent history, the MP for Birmingham Hall Green and Moseley's call for legal protection of specifically religious symbols and values has resulted in concerns about potential implications for free speech and the proper role of the state in regulating expressions of religious dissent and religious dissidence. Though Humanists UK has attained assurances from the government that there are no plans to reintroduce blasphemy laws or restrict free expression around religion, this episode -- not to mention the current Prime Minister's characteristically lacklustre response to Ali in Parliament -- raises a question: how are we to combat the aggressive rise of anti-Muslim hate, egregious examples of which were abundantly displayed during this August's riots, without compromising upon secularist commitments to the defence of freedom of conscience and expression?\\n\\nMany among this publication's readership may also be aware that this year marked 300 years since the birth in Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) of Immanuel Kant -- one of the greatest and most influential philosophers in history. Anniversaries such as these are apt to prompt reflection upon the legacy of a pioneering thinker and comparisons between their times and our own. They invite us to ask whether we still have anything to learn from so historically distant a figure as Kant. A leading champion of the Aufklärung -- Germany's contribution to the Age of Enlightenment -- Kant took pride in the spirit of free inquiry which he saw as the defining trait of his historical period, arguing for academic freedom and against censorship of the press.\\n\\n'Ours is the age of criticism, to which everything must submit', he wrote in The Critique of Pure Reason, meaning by 'criticism' not the vitriolic name-calling and unsubstantiated accusations characteristic of certain billionaire-owned social media platforms and associated political opportunists, but the patient and disciplined process of understanding through rational scrutiny. From this sustained project of questioning, challenging, and evaluating, Kant maintains, nothing is exempt -- not even the doctrines of a religion or the legislation of a state.\\n\\nTo return to certain legislative proposals recently mooted in Parliament, and although etymology is an unsure guide to the current meaning or use of a word, it is perhaps worthy of note that the origins of the term 'desecration' lie with the act of divesting something of an allegedly sacred status, and hence of removing that thing from an elevated position which commands respect or even reverence. With this in mind, accusations of desecration are premised upon the assumption that whatever is alleged to have been 'desecrated' is unlike ordinary things -- which is to say that it is in a class apart, meriting special treatment and attitudes of veneration. If that is the case, however, then refusal to consent to the allegedly privileged status of that thing, and to regulate one's actions, attitudes, and expressions accordingly, is to be as guilty of desecration as if one scuffed a Quran.\\n\\nAs such, legislation against desecration may be expected to raise concerns amongst those of us who believe that it is for the individual conscience to decide what should be valued in this privileged manner, rather than for the state and its legislative and juridical representatives, or, indeed, the followers and advocates of one or another set of religious doctrines, values, and practices. For the state to enforce respect for the purportedly 'sacred' status of certain symbols and institutions, religious or otherwise -- although the harsh policing of republican protests at last year's coronation suggests that caution is advised in offering the monarchy as an example here -- seems, at the very least, to mark a worrying departure from the ideal of open-minded critical inquiry in which Kant invites us to participate.\\n\\nThough justly confident of having secured his place in philosophical history, Kant lived in a manner which gave evidently little consideration to his later biographers -- of whom there have been understandably few given his life of near tragi-comic uneventfulness. Never in his life did he set foot more than 30 miles from his hometown, and it is said that fellow Königsbergers would set their clocks by the regularity of his walks -- a daily occurrence from which only news of the outbreak of the French Revolution ever once led him to depart.\\n\\nDuring a life otherwise exasperatingly unmarked by dramatic incident, however, one episode merits attention. In October 1794, Kant received a royal correspondence from the state censor expressing extreme displeasure at certain writings in which he was alleged to have 'misused' his philosophy 'to distort and negatively evaluate many of the cardinal and basic teachings of the Holy Scripture and of Christianity'. In order to avoid His Majesty's 'highest disfavour', Kant had to 'give at once a most conscientious account' of himself. Failure to mend his ways, he was told, must be expected to result in 'unpleasant measures' for his 'continued obstinacy.'\\n\\nThe prompt for this act of state intervention was the recent publication of Kant's Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason, an effort to assess which kinds of religious doctrine and organization might meet with our unprejudiced rational approval. Kant had already experienced obstacles from the state censor in publishing parts of this work and told friends that he expected it to result in the loss of his position at the University of Königsberg. Whatever today's audiences might make of his attempts to give a secular interpretation and defence of such dogmas as original sin and divine grace, and whatever Kant's true views about the validity of religion and the existence of God, many of Kant's contemporaries (the King of Prussia included) were struck by the temerity of his refusal to excuse received scriptural wisdom or ecclesiastical authority from the same critical standards he had employed elsewhere in his studies.\\n\\nEspecially concerning for Kant's more orthodox religious critics was his insistence that the doctrines and practices of any religion should answer to a secular morality of human dignity and freedom which affords no role to divine commandments. So uncompromising was Kant, in fact, in his suspicions of familiar arguments for divinely sanctioned ethics (and, indeed, for the very existence of God) that he earned the enviable title of der Allzermalmende (the All-Destroyer). Contemporary freethinkers and darkwave musicians will undoubtedly be disappointed to learn that this title is already taken.\\n\\nKant must have given either a persuasive or a carefully worded account of himself (or both) in his reply to His Majesty's demand. While he had prepared himself for immediate dismissal, Kant ultimately kept his position -- whereas Wöllner, the author of the royal correspondence in question, came satisfyingly close to losing his own. The apparent audacity of Kant's dealings with state and religious establishments might also remind us that he coined for his age of criticism and enlightenment the motto Sapere aude (dare to know). Enlightenment, Kant tells us, is the liberation of humankind from its 'self-imposed immaturity.' The German term Unmündigkeit, which standardly gets translated here as 'immaturity', can also mean 'tutelage' or 'minority' and implies a sheepish deference to authority. Since Mund means 'mouth', one who is unmündig is somehow presumed unqualified to speak on their own behalf. According to Kant, however, it is precisely in our capacity to reach our own conclusions and come to a free and rational decision about which values to uphold and how to direct our lives that our dignity as human beings consists.\\n\\nBetween the alleged dignity of a religious text or symbol, then, and that of the human conscience, there is simply no contest according to Kant. To demand respect for the former is thereby to deny it to the latter. At the same time, however, it is an impermissible affront to the dignity of a person to target them and deny their humanity simply for exercising their inalienable right to decide upon their religious values or rejection thereof.\\n\\nOpponents of recent proposals for anti-desecration legislation may therefore find an ally in Kant. Prejudice against religious minorities should be addressed not by insulating texts and symbols from criticism but by championing the humanity and dignity of every citizen, irrespective of their religious affiliation or lack thereof. Respect for our common humanity entails, however, that it is left to each of us to decide what, if anything, we are to treat as sacred, without the threat of reprisal either from the state or from misinformation-fuelled stooges of one or another reactionary and dehumanising agenda.\\n\\nThe featured image for this article (at the top) is a photo of Salwan Momika burning a Quran in 2023.

Neither makes sense without the other; this intertwining is a major thread in the human story.\\n\\nAt the moment, Britain is facing a very significant and imminent threat as these two spheres of activity combine once more. The new Labour government, according to all reliable political sources, was until recently planning to adopt and enshrine in the criminal law a definition of 'Islamophobia' which is intended to penalize 'hate speech' and extend to an unwonted degree the increasing shackles on free speech so characteristic of intolerant wokery.\\n\\nThe proposed definition would have drawn heavily upon, if not duplicated exactly, that of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on British Muslims. The APPG defines Islamophobia as 'rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness.'\\n\\nThankfully, the government seems to be backtracking. The faith minister, Wajid Khan, has signalled as much by saying that the APPG definition 'is not in line with the Equality Act 2010'. Still, Khan also stated that 'tackling religious hatred' was a priority for the government and that defining 'Islamophobia' is an important part of that. So, a watered-down version might be on the horizon. This is still very worrying, and a vigorous and urgent response to this threat is a pressing matter.\\n\\nThis response must involve a clear statement of the objections to anything like the APPG formula. First, it is ludicrously vague and impractical. We are all aware of the by now many absurd cases in which police officers have interrogated 'suspects' who have posted 'offensive' things online.\\n\\nSecondly, it will create a climate of anxiety and fear which will deter legitimate criticism of Islam. Is it going to be criminal to refer to Trevor Phillips's 2016 Channel 4 documentary What British Muslims Really Think, which suggested that a significant proportion of British Muslims held views that were at odds with mainstream British society, particularly on issues like homosexuality, gender equality, and integration? For example, more than half (52%) believed that homosexuality should not be legal, 39% agreed that 'wives should always obey their husbands', and 23% supported introducing Sharia law to Britain.\\n\\nPhillips argued that the findings highlighted a level of social segregation and a lack of integration among some Muslim communities in the UK. He used the phrase 'a nation within a nation' to describe the situation, suggesting that many British Muslims were living in parallel societies with values that were distinct from, and even contrary to, those of wider British society.\\n\\nThirdly, the whole concept of 'Islamophobia' is entirely spurious. I do not wish to needlessly duplicate the conclusive dismissal given to this term by the likes of Douglas Murray, Sam Harris, and Christopher Hitchens. Suffice it to say that the introduction of the word is a brilliant, and successful, propaganda coup. By this act of lexical legerdemain, which reminds us of the similar term 'homophobia', the plight of Muslims as an oppressed group is compared to the plight of gays and other persecuted minorities. The strategy is all the more offensive in that Islam is fanatically opposed to homosexuality.\\n\\nThe legal definition of 'Islamophobia', whether it draws on the APPG definition or not, will almost certainly have as its central component the claim that 'Islamophobia' is a form of racism. This claim -- entirely and obviously, even on its face, false -- is made nowadays as a matter of routine and, weirdly, it is rarely challenged (quite recently, to give one example, I have heard Baroness Warsi repeat it with assurance).\\n\\nThe claim is the work of tireless operators in the field of 'anti-racism'. By 'anti-racism', I mean that activity undertaken by journalists and politicians of heresy-hunting for and show-trial-like denunciations of anything deemed to have fallen afoul of a woke orthodoxy which reifies contested theories of race and racism into unchallengeable truth. (This activity, not so coincidentally, is a sure way of gaining political power, journalistic prestige, and wealth.) I do not mean genuine opponents of racism. Some examples of this type of 'anti-racist' include David Lammy and Chris Bryant in the House of Commons and Jonathan Freedland and Owen Jones at The Guardian ('the loathsome Owen Jones', according to George Galloway). They all repeat the assertion that 'Islamophobia' is racism without ever deigning to offer any evidence. It is supposed to be self-evident.\\n\\nI would like to explore in more detail just how this linkage came about. The more intellectual YouTube podcasters seem nearly unanimous in blaming it on the malign effects of postmodernism. Although this probably played a role, I believe there is a more obvious explanation.\\n\\nAround half a century ago, I could be found marching through the London streets demonstrating against apartheid; against violence against women; in favour of gay rights. Almost all of my fellow protestors were anti-racist and anti-Islam (and indeed anti-monotheism in general). We hated discrimination and we hated religion. We saw that the two were connected. What was apartheid but the creation of the Dutch Reformed Church? What was sexism but a product of misogynistic preachments from the godly? What was monotheism but the sole theoretical underpinning of homophobia?\\n\\nFast forward to the present, and the anti-religious progressives of the '70s and '80s are now grovelling at the feet of the mullahs. How and why did this complete reversal occur?\\n\\nThere was a point in British political history -- difficult to pinpoint but around 1985 -- when the central narrative of the left, the class struggle, began to lose its persuasive power. Skilled workers were taking holidays on exotic beaches, driving expensive cars, and earning more than junior doctors. They no longer felt like an underclass. Gradually the left replaced the old meta-narrative with a new one: racism. It caught on and the left became obsessive. Political allegiance was now defined in terms of attitudes to race. More and more aspects of life previously considered uncontroversial -- what you ate, where you took holidays, how you wore your hair -- became political. Ludicrous doctrines emerged, for example that white people sporting dreadlocks were guilty of 'cultural appropriation' which, of course, was viewed as 'racist'.\\n\\nConsider the ludicrous case of Amber Rudd and David Lammy. In March 2019, during an interview on BBC Radio 2, Amber Rudd, then a member of the Cabinet, was discussing the challenges faced by women in politics, specifically black and minority ethnic women. She referred to then-shadow home secretary Diane Abbott as 'coloured'. This was certainly awkward. At the very worst, Rudd was culpably ignorant of current practice. Certainly, there was no deliberate offence. But Rudd was piled on for this small misstep (made in the context of lamenting misogyny and racism!).\\n\\nMuslims are a minority, many of them immigrants or descended from recent immigrants, and for these reasons, they historically vote Labour (this pattern, interestingly, might be breaking; in the recent election, some Muslims stood against Labour due to Labour's prevarication on the Israel-Palestine issue -- and George Galloway, incidentally, leapt on this for his own political benefit). The left wished to consolidate its political support amongst this group, and as Muslims were subject to hostility by certain sectors of the British public, the left correctly felt that defending them would be an electoral gain. So they were faced with the choice of defending Muslims on the grounds of race, or those of religion, the two supposed reasons for anti-Muslim sentiment.\\n\\nHere, an obvious contradiction occurs. The left wanted to support LGBT and women's rights and secular values, but it also wanted to support a group containing many members who were antithetical to these values. The resolution of this conflict was simply to pretend that all hostility to the Muslim religion was not really what it seemed, but racism instead. It was a blatant and sinister Orwellian deception. Now, if you were critical of Islam or Muslims, you were simply reassigned to the racist camp. And like all propaganda, the more often this idea was repeated, the more it became rooted in the soil.\\n\\nAnd now we have the poisonous fruit: a government which is prepared to label all those hostile to the religious dogmas and practices of Islam as 'racist', in defiance of all logic and common sense, and to do so for electoral support and because of a cowardly intellectual capitulation to a corrupting zeitgeist.\\n\\nRelated reading\\n\\nCancel culture and religious intolerance: 'Falsely Accused of Islamophobia', by Steven Greer, by Daniel James Sharp\\n\\nBritish Islam and the crisis of 'wokeism' in universities: interview with Steven Greer, by Emma Park\\n\\nConfronting identity politics, a breeding ground for division and dehumanisation, by Maryam Namazie\\n\\nMy punk rock cancellation, by Gerfried Ambrosch\\n\\nThe need to rekindle irreverence for Islam in Muslim thought, by Kunwar Khuldune Shahid\\n\\nFree speech in Britain: a losing battle? by Porcus Sapiens\"}, {'topic': 'Religion Values', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech and religion values', 'title': \"France's Charlie Hebdo Holds God Cartoon Contest To Mark 10 Years Of Attack\", 'url': 'https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/frances-charlie-hebdo-holds-god-cartoon-contest-10-years-since-attack-7253624', 'published_date': '2024-12-15T10:54:00Z', 'source': 'NDTV', 'content': 'Charlie Hebdo has regularly tested the boundaries of French hate speech laws.\\n\\nParis:\\n\\nTen years after a deadly attack on its office that shocked France, Charlie Hebdo magazine is marking the anniversary with a cartoon contest mocking God, with Sunday the deadline for submissions.\\n\\nThe satirical weekly was targeted by two Islamic extremists on January 7, 2014, who gunned down eight members of staff including some of the country\\'s most famous cartoonists inside its premises in central Paris.\\n\\nThe attackers -- two brothers who were later killed by police -- targeted Charlie Hebdo after its decision to publish caricatures lampooning the Prophet Mohammed, Islam\\'s most revered figure.\\n\\nIn typically provocative style, the staunchly atheist magazine has invited cartoonists to submit the \"funniest and meanest\" drawings mocking God possible ahead of the anniversary.\\n\\nLaunching it last month with a deadline of December 15, it addressed a message to \"everyone who is fed up with living in a society directed by God and religion.

According to the Daily Mail, they now include children who have been pulled in for calling other children schoolyard names like \"retard\" or saying that other children smell \"like fish.\"\\n\\n\"A nine-year-old child is among the youngsters being probed by police over hate incidents... Officers recorded incidents against the child, who called a fellow primary school pupil a \\'retard\\', and against two schoolgirls who said another student smelled \\'like fish.\\' The youngsters were among multiple cases of children being recorded as having committed non-crime hate incidents (NCHIs), The Times discovered through freedom of information requests to police forces.\"\\n\\n\"Non-crime hate\" was introduced in 2014 as part of the Hate Crime Operational Guidelines.\\n\\nIt is chilling in its ambiguity and scope.

Evidence of the hostility is not required.\"\\n\\nThat guarantees the maximal level of investigation and documentation of speech incidents. The chilling effect on free speech is glacial.\\n\\nFor years, I have been writing about the decline of free speech in the United Kingdom and the steady stream of arrests. A man was convicted for sending a tweet while drunk referring to dead soldiers. Another was arrested for an anti-police t-shirt. Another was arrested for calling the Irish boyfriend of his ex-girlfriend a \"leprechaun.\" Yet another was arrested for singing \"Kung Fu Fighting.\" A teenager was arrested for protesting outside of a Scientology center with a sign calling the religion a \"cult.\"Last year, Nicholas Brock, 52, was convicted of a thought crime in Maidenhead, Berkshire. The neo-Nazi was given a four-year sentence for what the court called his \"toxic ideology\" based on the contents of the home he shared with his mother in Maidenhead, Berkshire.\\n\\nWhile most of us find Brock\\'s views repellent and hateful, they were confined to his head and his room. Yet, Judge Peter Lodder QC dismissed free speech or free thought concerns with a truly Orwellian statement:\\n\\n\"I do not sentence you for your political views, but the extremity of those views informs the assessment of dangerousness.\"\\n\\nLodder lambasted Brock for holding Nazi and other hateful values:\\n\\n\"[i]t is clear that you are a right-wing extremist, your enthusiasm for this repulsive and toxic ideology is demonstrated by the graphic and racist iconography which you have studied and appeared to share with others...\"\\n\\nEven though Lodder agreed that the defendant was older, had limited mobility, and \"there was no evidence of disseminating to others,\" he still sent him to prison for holding extremist views.\\n\\nAfter the sentencing, Detective Chief Superintendent Kath Barnes, Head of Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE), warned others that he was going to prison because he \"showed a clear right-wing ideology with the evidence seized from his possessions during the investigation....We are committed to tackling all forms of toxic ideology which has the potential to threaten public safety and security.\"\\n\\nGreat Britain is now turning, it appears, to their children in speech crackdowns. Schoolyard taunts can be investigated by officers. The impact on both parents and children will obviously be immense. It adds a coercive element to speech laws. Given the subjective and vague standard, the response is to self-censor to avoid any such accusations. Raising children in such an environment will only erode free speech values. Indeed, it fosters the type of speech-phobic generation that many activists may welcome. Speech is viewed as dangerous and subject to continual monitoring by the state.\\n\\nStopping some kid from using a playground taunt will do little to instill mutual respect, but it will instill fear over how the state may respond to your words. It is a lesson that many in the free speech community may relish but one that most citizens should reject. \"Non-crime hate\" investigations are meant to maintain a constant sense of oversight and monitoring of speech, even with our children.\\n\\nJonathan Turley is the Shapiro professor of public interest law at George Washington University and the author of \"The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage.\"'}, {'topic': 'Religion Values', 'expanded_query': 'hate speech and religion values', 'title': 'Virginia Real Estate Agent Could Lose License for Posting Scriptures About Marriage', 'url': 'https://cbn.com/news/us/virginia-real-estate-agent-could-lose-license-posting-scriptures-about-marriage', 'published_date': '2024-11-18T19:38:31Z', 'source': 'CBN.com - The Christian Broadcasting Network', 'content': 'A veteran Virginia real estate agent is facing professional ethics charges and could lose his license after sharing scripture on social media that pointed out that marriage is between and a woman.\\n\\nThe Founding Freedoms Law Center (FFLC), a non-profit legal group, is representing Wilson Fauber in a December 4 hearing before the National Association of Realtors (NAR) ethics panel for sharing his biblical views on marriage and sexuality.\\n\\nAccording to the group, Fauber posted comments to his personal Facebook page explaining the biblical definition of marriage as being between one man and one woman.\\n\\n\"In 2015, I posted Biblical quotes on my personal Facebook page,\" Fauber told The Federalist. \"Around the same time, Rev.

The strategy, which emphasizes a multi-year approach, underscores the critical need for a united societal effort to combat this deeply entrenched issue. According to a recently published report in The Jerusalem Post, this ambitious plan is being coordinated by the Ministry of Justice and Security, with the National Coordinator for Combating Anti-Semitism Unit playing a pivotal advisory and implementation role. The cabinet has committed to annual reviews of the strategy\\'s efficacy, ensuring adaptability and the potential for enhanced measures as necessary.\\n\\nThe report in The Jerusalem Post highlighted the Dutch government\\'s statement which emphasized the collective responsibility of all citizens in addressing anti-Semitism and ensuring the security of Jewish individuals. \"With the current strategy, the government makes it clear that the fight against anti-Semitism concerns all Dutch people,\" the statement declares. The government\\'s vision for the Netherlands as an \"open, reasonable, and tolerant society\" positions Jewish life as an integral and celebrated part of the national identity. To support this endeavor, the government has allocated €4.5 million, signaling a substantial commitment to the initiative.\\n\\nThe urgency of this strategy is evident in the cabinet\\'s acknowledgment of the Dutch Jewish community\\'s precarious circumstances. As per the information provided in The Jerusalem Post report, the community -- numbering approximately 50,000 individuals, or 0.3% of the total population -- \"lives in great insecurity\" and experiences limitations on their freedom. This grim reality necessitates immediate and sustained action, prompting the establishment of a dedicated task force under the Justice and Security Ministry\\'s leadership. The task force will remain operational for at least a year, focusing on critical areas such as combating anti-Semitism in universities and barring anti-Semitic speakers from educational institutions.\\n\\nThe task force is a collaborative effort, comprising representatives from various ministries, local governments, educational institutions, sports organizations, cultural entities, public transportation sectors, and other societal stakeholders. As reported by The Jerusalem Post, representatives from the Jewish community will also play an essential role in this initiative, ensuring that the community\\'s unique perspectives and needs are adequately addressed.\\n\\nThe strategy itself is anchored on three foundational pillars: \"protect, monitor, and follow-up;\" \"education and prevention;\" and \"commemoration and celebration.\" The Jerusalem Post report elaborated that the first pillar focuses on safeguarding Jewish institutions, holding perpetrators accountable, and providing robust support for victims. This approach is intended to establish a secure environment for Jewish communities while ensuring that acts of anti-Semitism face unequivocal repercussions.\\n\\nEducation and prevention form the second pillar, which aims to dismantle the underlying breeding grounds of anti-Semitism. According to the information contained in The Jerusalem Post report, this includes initiatives to combat anti-Semitism in sports, a sector often overlooked in discussions about prejudice and discrimination. By addressing these root causes, the government seeks to foster a more inclusive and respectful societal framework.\\n\\nThe third pillar, commemoration and celebration, seeks to honor and preserve Jewish heritage in the Netherlands. Indicated in The Jerusalem Post report was that this involves promoting awareness of Jewish history and culture while celebrating the contributions of Jewish life to Dutch society. Through these efforts, the government aims to ensure that Jewish memory remains a vibrant and integral part of the national narrative.\\n\\nOne of the cornerstone issues addressed in the strategy is the significant underreporting of anti-Semitic incidents. According to The Jerusalem Post report, a 2018 EU report revealed that 74% of Dutch Jews who experience anti-Semitism do not report the incidents to anyone, with the rate only slightly better (52%) in cases of violent anti-Semitism. This widespread reluctance to report highlights a systemic problem, one that the government aims to tackle by fostering an environment where victims feel confident that their reports will lead to meaningful action.\\n\\n\"By reporting incidents as standard, more incidents can be followed up, but there is also better insight into where anti-Semitism occurs and where it comes from,\" the strategy states, according to The Jerusalem Post report. To support this effort, the government plans to set up a \"Safety Fund,\" which will provide financial assistance to Jewish institutions for their security systems. This initiative seeks to alleviate the disproportionate financial burden these institutions currently face in safeguarding their communities.\\n\\nIn their extensive report, The Jerusalem Post further detailed that the government is revising the existing reporting mechanisms involving municipal anti-discrimination facilities (ADVs). These updates aim to ensure that victims of anti-Semitism can report incidents with greater confidence and ease. Recognizing that many victims currently turn to the Center for Information and Documentation Israel (CIDI) rather than local centers, the strategy includes a plan to liaise with CIDI and establish robust protocols for sharing information, thereby streamlining the reporting process and enhancing data collection.\\n\\nAnother critical element of this pillar is the provision of aftercare for victims. The report in The Jerusalem Post noted that the government has allocated a specific budget for this purpose, underlining its commitment to addressing the psychological and social impacts of anti-Semitic incidents. Additionally, the justice minister has called for an official investigation into the \"bottlenecks\" that victims encounter when reporting anti-Semitism. Scheduled to begin in 2025, the objective of this investigation is to identify obstacles and use the findings to inform new, more effective measures.\\n\\nLegislative action also features prominently in the strategy. The Jerusalem Post also reported that the cabinet has proposed a bill to increase the maximum prison sentence for anti-Semitic offenses by one-third. This measure calls attention to the government\\'s commitment to imposing harsher penalties on those who perpetrate hate crimes, signaling a strong deterrent to potential offenders.\\n\\nAddressing the growing prevalence of online anti-Semitism, the task force will conduct an annual study into anti-Semitic content on Dutch-language platforms. As detailed in The Jerusalem Post report, this initiative is part of a broader effort to gain deeper insights into the nature and scale of digital anti-Semitism, enabling the government to adapt its policies to the evolving landscape of hate speech.\\n\\nIn a robust push against rising anti-Semitism, European nations are spearheading legal, educational, and digital initiatives, as detailed by The Jerusalem Post. Public prosecutors from 15 European countries convened recently to share insights on addressing anti-Semitism within their criminal justice systems. This meeting, described by The Jerusalem Post as \"successful,\" highlighted the increasing importance of international collaboration in combating hate speech and discrimination.\\n\\nAs reported by The Jerusalem Post, the Netherlands enacted a new law on October 1 criminalizing all forms of Holocaust denial. This move reflects a growing recognition of the need to counteract denialism and misinformation, aligning with broader European efforts to address historical distortion.\\n\\nEducation emerges as a cornerstone in the fight against anti-Semitism, according to The Jerusalem Post. A key focus of the second pillar in Europe\\'s strategy is addressing the \"breeding grounds\" of anti-Semitism, particularly conspiracy theories and online hate speech. A 2022 study cited by The Jerusalem Post revealed that out of 200,395 instances of online anti-Semitism, over 11% explicitly targeted Judaism. Tackling this surge requires fostering awareness and understanding through education.\\n\\nIn the Netherlands, this educational focus manifests through initiatives such as enhanced citizenship education, which plays a pivotal role in addressing anti-Semitism and broader discrimination. The Jerusalem Post report highlighted the Dutch government\\'s acknowledgment of the alarming decline in Holocaust awareness among its population, prompting a four-year educational scheme to reinvigorate Holocaust education and share forgotten stories of World War II. Starting in January, the \"Learn about the Holocaust\" campaign will lay the groundwork for these efforts.\\n\\nIn addition to school-based initiatives, new measures will require immigrants to demonstrate knowledge of the Holocaust and answer questions about anti-Semitism to pass integration exams beginning July 1, 2025, according to The Jerusalem Post. These policies aim to ensure that newcomers are equipped with an understanding of historical and cultural contexts, reinforcing societal commitments to combating hate.\\n\\nThe plan also includes a National Plan for Strengthening Holocaust Education, with progress updates scheduled for the Dutch House of Representatives in fall 2025. As reported by The Jerusalem Post, this holistic approach reflects a commitment to rooting out anti-Semitism through both systemic education and individual accountability.\\n\\nDigital platforms are another critical battleground, with the European Union leveraging the Digital Services Act (DSA) to combat online anti-Semitism. As noted by The Jerusalem Post, the DSA mandates that platforms promptly evaluate and act upon reports of illegal content or face significant fines -- up to 6% of their global turnover. This act enhances transparency by requiring platforms to submit moderation decisions to the European Commission for inclusion in the DSA Transparency Database.\\n\\nFurther bolstering these efforts, the Netherlands\\' National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Security, in collaboration with law enforcement, has developed a \"symbol bank\" to aid professionals in identifying and responding to extremist and anti-Semitic symbols. This initiative ensures that professionals across sectors are equipped to recognize and address hate symbols effectively.\\n\\nIn a novel initiative supported by the Anne Frank Foundation, the KNVB\\'s \"Chanting Project\" seeks to educate fans on the harmful impacts of anti-Semitic chants. As noted in The Jerusalem Post report, fans found guilty of engaging in such behavior may be required to participate in this program, which focuses on fostering awareness among supporters. This educational approach complements the broader strategy\\'s emphasis on reducing the spread of hate through proactive measures.\\n\\nThe third pillar of the strategy focuses on commemoration and celebration, emphasizing the Netherlands\\' responsibility to preserve its Jewish heritage. As The Jerusalem Post report highlighted, the Dutch government acknowledges its \"special historical responsibility\" stemming from its role in World War II. This responsibility includes safeguarding tangible and intangible aspects of Jewish history and ensuring they are passed on to future generations.\\n\\nTo promote Holocaust education and awareness, January will now be designated as Holocaust Education Month. According to The Jerusalem Post, this initiative aims to spotlight the importance of Holocaust education and enhance access to relevant materials and activities, particularly in schools. Additionally, April 25 has been declared the National Day Against Anti-Semitism, a move intended to unify Dutch society in its commitment to combating discrimination.\\n\\nIn a broader effort to respect and celebrate Jewish life, the Dutch government has urged institutions and businesses to consider Jewish and Islamic holidays, the Sabbath, and dietary restrictions. The Jerusalem Post report noted that this aligns with existing practices surrounding other holidays and aims to create a more inclusive environment for religious observance.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science has also made significant strides in preserving Jewish heritage. As reported by The Jerusalem Post, the ministry provides structural subsidies under the Heritage Act to the Jewish Cultural Quarter for public activities and the management of the Jewish Museum\\'s collection. Furthermore, an additional 80 former synagogues and 71 Jewish cemeteries have been designated as national monuments, offering their owners access to financial support for maintenance and ensuring their protection for future generations.\\n\\nThe Public Prosecution Service also registered a significant increase in anti-Semitic offenses, with 181 cases recorded in 2023 compared to 94 in 2022. This alarming rise speaks volumes about a deepening issue that demands immediate attention, as detailed by The Jerusalem Post.\\n\\nWhile Dutch government agencies do not publicly categorize perpetrator groups in anti-Semitic incidents, the most recent Terrorism Threat Assessment in the Netherlands identifies anti-Semitism within left-wing extremism, jihadism, and right-wing extremism. As reported by The Jerusalem Post, these findings reveal that anti-Semitism transcends political and ideological divides, manifesting in various forms across the spectrum of extremism.\\n\\nThe report further highlights the impact of international events, noting that the conflict in Gaza has \"lowered the threshold for radical Islamic individuals who do not adhere to jihadist ideology\" to justify attacks on Jewish or Israeli individuals and institutions. This correlation between geopolitical conflict and domestic anti-Semitic acts adds a complex dimension to the issue, as explained by The Jerusalem Post.\\n\\nA striking finding, highlighted by The Jerusalem Post, is the prevalence of anti-Semitism within the context of soccer. A Panteia research study, commissioned by the Anne Frank Foundation, found that soccer is the most common setting where students insult Jews. These insults often spill over into schools, perpetuating anti-Semitic attitudes among younger generations.\\n\\nThe study also revealed demographic patterns in anti-Semitic expressions. Insults tied to the Middle East conflict predominantly originate from Dutch-Moroccan or Dutch-Turkish students, who were found to hold more negative attitudes toward Jews than their peers of Dutch, Surinamese, or Caribbean Dutch descent. This differentiation underscores the influence of cultural and political contexts on anti-Semitic attitudes, as noted in the report.\\n\\nThe findings detailed by The Jerusalem Post paint a concerning picture of rising anti-Semitism in the Netherlands, driven by a lethal combination of extremist ideologies, geopolitical tensions, and cultural influences. The increase in both reported incidents and violent offenses shines a spotlight on the urgency of addressing this issue through targeted education, stricter enforcement of hate crime laws, and community outreach.\\n\\nThe government\\'s recognition of these diverse sources of anti-Semitism provides a foundation for comprehensive interventions. However, as The Jerusalem Post report emphasized, the complexity of the issue requires nuanced solutions that account for its multifaceted origins, from soccer culture to global conflicts.'}]]\n"
