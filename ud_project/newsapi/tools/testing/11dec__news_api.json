        "content": "WASHINGTON, DC -- How can diverse communities move beyond fragmented narratives of the past to forge a shared vision of the future that honors truth while fostering unity?\n\nThis question lies at the heart of a recent collaboration between the Bahá'í Office of Public Affairs of the United States and the Aspen Institute's Religion and Society Program. Growing out of shared efforts of the Office's Narratives of America Project and the work of the Religion and Society Program, this partnership has culminated in a volume of essays that draws on insights from religion to explore America's evolving story.\n\nThis initiative was born out of a profound need to counter the effects of racial and economic injustice that continue to shape the American experience. Selvi Adaikkalam Zabihi, a member of the Office of Public Affairs, said in conversation with the News Service, \"Recognizing that unity is at the heart of these challenges, the project aims to explore how a shared narrative can help build a collective identity and vision for the future that honors the dignity and contributions of all communities.\"\n\nThe volume, titled Religious Perspectives on the Narratives of America: The Search for Just, Honest, Inclusive and Forward-looking Tellings, brings together 11 essays authored by people from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds, including Sikh, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and the Bahá'í Faith, as well as the traditions of Indigenous Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\n\nThe Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly of the United States, in a message to the Bahá'ís of that country, emphasized the significance of the project, stating: \"Narratives are important for both individual and shared understanding. They help us interpret the world and shape our sense of purpose and identity. Narratives can offer hope or preclude it, obscure the truth or help us search for it. It is clear that, as a nation, we need unifying, ennobling, and empowering narratives to help us move forward collectively.\"\n\nPJ Andrews, a member of the Bahá'í Office of Public Affairs, in a conversation with the News Service, observed that \"when we engage with America's story through the lens of spiritual teachings, we can move beyond simply documenting historical events to understanding their deeper significance in humanity's journey toward unity.\"\n\nThrough a series of gatherings convened by the Aspen Institute's Religion and Society Program in collaboration with the Office of Public Affairs at Green Acre Bahá'í School and online spaces for dialogue, contributors to the volume engaged in deep conversations about how religious insights could illuminate pathways toward healing and transformation. These discussions created an environment where challenging topics could be explored with both candor and hope.\n\n\"Consultation was essential in creating a sense of community among the contributors,\" Mr. Andrews noted. \"In these spaces they could share their thinking and their writing with each other, thus creating a cohesive and enriching narrative that reflects the diversity and unity of America.\"\n\nMr. Andrews further elaborated, \"America is a country with many contested stories about how we got here and who we are. We are interested in articulating a shared identity that transcends secondary identities like race, gender, or national origin.\n\n\"When we think of narratives,\" he continued, \"there are three components we believe are essential: a conception of history, a sense of identity, and a vision of the future.\"\n\nMr. Andrews explained these elements draw from the perspective offered by the Bahá'í Faith on spiritual and social transformation -- that despite the upheavals and seemingly insurmountable struggles it is facing, humanity is moving through stages of collective development toward an age of maturity characterized by unity.\n\n\"This perspective allows us to engage with historical challenges while maintaining hope and purpose in working toward the realization of the oneness of humanity,\" he said. \"It helps us recognize that the current struggles we face as a nation are part of a larger process of spiritual and social maturation.\"\n\nMs. Zabihi elaborated, explaining that the Bahá'í teachings highlight the idea of an ever-advancing civilization in which both forces of disintegration and constructive forces have been operating throughout history. \"Understanding this dual process helps us recognize that while we face serious challenges, we can also identify and strengthen the constructive forces at work,\" she said. \"This perspective allows individuals to see their role in social transformation and contribute to building unity while acknowledging difficult truths about the past and present.\"\n\nAt the launch event, Audrey Price, Deputy Director of the Religion and Society Program and co-editor of the volume with Ms. Zabihi, expressed her enthusiasm for the project:\n\n\"I am excited about the release of this collection of essays. The authors bring forth rich and diverse narratives that are often hidden and marginalized in America.\"\n\nRev. Dr. Price added: \"Through masterful and personal storytelling, we experience the beautiful, mosaic tapestry of the communities who define America. We hear voices that invite us to see, affirm, and cherish the human dignity of everyone.\"\n\nMr. Andrews highlighted the significance of collaboration in shaping a just and inclusive narrative for the nation.\n\n\"One of the remarkable aspects of this project is its ongoing nature. At its core are essential questions about the narrative of America that we seek -- a narrative that is just, honest, forward-looking, and helps us heal while moving forward together. No single person has all the answers, but the process of figuring this out is collaborative,\" he remarked.\n\nMs. Zabihi emphasized the significance of the project at a time when profound questions about identity, belonging, and social cohesion are at the forefront of national consciousness. \"This moment calls for expanding our conversations about America's narratives,\" she said. \"The divisions we see today make it clear that new approaches to building understanding across differences are urgently needed.\"\n\nShe added: \"Religion can be a significant source of ideas and inspiration for this narrative work. We aim to learn how religious perspectives can enrich the broader conversation about social transformation without imposing beliefs on others or being constrained by secular dogmatism.\n\n\"Through this process,\" she continued, \"we are discovering how spiritual principles can help create spaces for meaningful dialogue that acknowledges historical truths while fostering hope and unity.\"\n\nSpeaking about the broader aims of the Narratives of America Project, Mr. Andrews explained, \"Rather than advocating for particular positions, the focus is on developing capacity for collective exploration of truth and building pathways to unity.\"\n\nHe continued: \"As communities across America grapple with questions of identity and belonging, the volume of essays demonstrates how engaging with diverse perspectives can help transform fragmented narratives into a shared vision for the future.\n\n\"Through creating spaces where truth and unity can coexist, where historical acknowledgment can foster healing rather than division, new possibilities emerge for moving forward together. The ongoing nature of this work suggests that the process of building such narratives is itself part of the journey toward social transformation.\""

        "content": "TOMMY THOMAS views Malaysia's identity through a secular, critical lens, seeing race and religion as divisive forces.\n\nBut this view overlooks an essential truth for many Malaysians -- especially the Malay-Muslim majority -- that Islam and Malay identity are core pillars of national unity.\n\nFor Malays, Islam is central to their identity and sense of belonging.\n\nThis connection to Islam drove them to resist British plans after WWII, like the Malayan Union, which would have reduced their political rights and weakened the Malay Sultans.\n\nThis resistance led to the Federation of Malaya, where the Malay rulers were reinstated as constitutional monarchs, honoring their cultural and historical role.\n\nThe constitution reflects this foundation, establishing Islam as the religion of the Federation while protecting all communities.\n\nThe events that Thomas sees as setbacks -- such as the 1969 riots and the 1980s emphasis on Islam -- were not purely racial or religious but part of Malaysia's journey to nationhood.\n\nThe 1969 riots, for instance, stemmed from political tensions rather than racial animosity alone.\n\nThey reflected deeper struggles over political power and economic opportunity in a rapidly changing society.\n\nPolicies like the New Economic Policy (NEP) and the focus on Malay rights and Islam were responses to social realities in a diverse nation.\n\nThey aimed to give the Malay majority a sense of security and place within a multi-ethnic Malaysia.\n\nMalaysia's growth, like any young nation, has seen both successes and challenges.\n\nSince independence, Malaysia has developed rapidly, achieving economic progress and shaping a unique identity that respects all groups within a Malay-Islamic framework.\n\nThis balance of challenges and achievements has built a stable, resilient nation.\n\nWhile Thomas raises points for reflection, his secular view does not fully appreciate the cultural and historical values that shape Malaysia.\n\nFor many Malaysians, race and religion are not divisive but are meaningful aspects of their identity.\n\nThe Malay-Muslim identity has long been a stabilizing force, uniting a diverse society through shared values.\n\nIn essence, Thomas's critique overlooks a deeper truth: Malaysia's unity does not come from erasing race and religion but from recognizing and respecting each community's unique place within a shared national framework.\n\nThis framework is anchored in Malay identity and the role of Islam, which are central to the country's character and cohesion.\n\nThe nation-building journey that Thomas critiques reflects Malaysia's ongoing efforts to balance diversity with unity, honoring a unique national identity that celebrates differences rather than denying them.\n\nThis is something we must make an effort to learn and understand, as it highlights the importance of an inclusive society where all communities feel valued.\n\n*GHAFAR MOHAMAD - Chairman of the Advisory Council of the Malay Professionals Organisation also known as Pertubuhan Profesional Melayu & Pewaris Bangsa (ProWaris)"

        "content": "Sammanfattning: In this thesis civil religion in the Czech Republic is studied throught the way it is expressed in the speeches of president Václav Havel. Earlier studies on civil religion have shown how civil religiion can be a latent phenomenon that is activated in times of societal change and crisis. In Havel's speeches, this is expressed by the emphasis put on democratic values, such as basic human rights, and the return of history to a country that was subjected to a totalitarian regime during a long period of time. Through the analysis of Havel's speeches from 1990-1999, the elements and symbols of the Czech civil religion become evident. These elements and symbols are found in the history of the nation, and Havel often emphasizes how important it is to know the truth about history. An important factor in this research is the need for an overarching civil religion, that could tie the citizens to the state, as well as to each other. This need arose as communism was ousted and the society started changing rapidly. The developing society became differentiated, and a religious indifference prevailed. This made it impossible for the established religion to encompass all the citizens and create cohesion in soicety, thereby legitimating it. The foundation of the Czech civil religion are democratic and liberal values, something that makes it a general civil religion. It has, however, specific, Czech elements, namely the notions of truth, freedom, tolerance and unity. A special form of unity formed among the citizens durig the struggle for freedom in 1989, and Havel played an important part in the development. This has given him great influence over the citizens, and he has had the possibility to shape the civil religion, so that it includes the elements that he finds important. He puts special emphasis on national holidays and commemorations, that form a civil religious calendar and make it possible to hold symbolic manifestations that create a unity among the citizens. The main task of the civil religion in the Czech Republic is to tie the different spheres of society together, thus forming a common basis of values, on which society rests and through which society is legitimated."

        "content": "The Indian Constitution is crucial in safeguarding basic rights, promoting equality, and establishing a democratic framework for governance. It ensures the fair distribution of power, fosters national unity, and upholds the rule of law. Over 70 years later, it continues to adapt to modern challenges while protecting citizens' rights and guiding India's growth.\n\n75th Constitution Day, also called Samvidhan Divas, is celebrated every year on November 26 to honour the adoption of the Indian Constitution by the Constituent Assembly in 1949. This historic event marked the beginning of India's journey as a democratic republic. The Constitution, which came into force on January 26, 1950, reflects the collective wisdom and dreams of India's founders.\n\nImportance\n\nThe Indian Constitution is a vital document that guarantees the basic rights and freedoms of its citizens. It sets up the structure and functioning of the government, making sure there is a fair distribution of power. Here's why the Constitution is so important:\n\nProtects Basic Rights: It safeguards rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly, ensuring individual freedoms.\n\nPromotes Equality: It works toward creating a fair society by addressing issues like caste discrimination and gender inequality.\n\nEstablishes Democracy: It sets up a democratic system that allows citizens to actively participate in politics and hold the government accountable.\n\nStrengthens Unity: It brings together India's diverse population, encouraging national unity and integrity.\n\nSpeech 1: The Making of the Constitution\n\nThe Indian Constitution is the cornerstone of our democratic nation, a reflection of the vision and determination of our leaders. The process of creating this remarkable document began in 1946, when the Constituent Assembly was formed. It was a time when India was on the cusp of gaining independence from British rule, and the future of the country had to be shaped from scratch. The members of the Constituent Assembly, led by figures such as Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, and Maulana Azad, worked tirelessly to create a framework that would govern a diverse and vibrant nation like India.\n\nThe journey of drafting the Constitution was not an easy one. The members of the Constituent Assembly faced numerous challenges, including differences in regional interests, languages, and cultures. Despite these challenges, they managed to create a document that emphasized equality, justice, and democracy. It was a document that would serve not only as the foundation for governance but also as a beacon for the rights and freedoms of every citizen. The Constitution, adopted on November 26, 1949, was a symbol of India's aspirations to be a sovereign, democratic republic.\n\nSpeech 2: The Relevance of the Constitution Today\n\nEven though the Indian Constitution was adopted over 70 years ago, its relevance today is stronger than ever. In fact, the Constitution continues to guide India as it faces modern-day challenges and opportunities. As we navigate a rapidly changing world, the fundamental principles enshrined in the Constitution -- such as democracy, justice, equality, and liberty -- serve as a beacon of hope and stability.\n\nOne of the greatest strengths of the Indian Constitution is its adaptability. It provides a framework for the governance of a country as diverse and dynamic as India, while also allowing for changes and amendments in response to new challenges. The Constitution has been amended multiple times to address issues ranging from social justice to economic reforms, always ensuring that the needs of the people are met without compromising on core values.\n\nIn the 21st century, the Constitution continues to play a vital role in safeguarding the rights of citizens. Whether through the protection of fundamental rights or upholding the rule of law, the Constitution ensures that every individual's voice is heard and respected. As technology advances and global interconnectedness grows, the Constitution remains a stable guide in our pursuit of progress and prosperity.\n\nSpeech 3: My Rights, My Responsibilities\n\nAs citizens of India, we are privileged to live in a democracy where the Constitution protects our rights. These rights -- ranging from the freedom of speech and expression to the right to equality before the law -- are not just privileges but also responsibilities. It is important to understand that with rights come duties, and it is our responsibility to exercise these rights in a way that benefits society as a whole.\n\nThe Constitution guarantees each citizen the freedom to express themselves, practice their religion, and participate in the democratic process. However, these rights come with the obligation to respect the rights of others and to contribute positively to society. For example, the freedom of speech must be exercised responsibly, without inciting hate or violence. The right to equality demands that we treat everyone, regardless of caste, creed, or gender, with respect and fairness.\n\nSpeech 4: Celebrating Diversity\n\nIndia is a land of immense diversity, with over 2,000 distinct languages, various cultures, religions, and traditions. Yet, despite this vast diversity, the Constitution of India ensures that all citizens are treated equally, regardless of their background. The Constitution's commitment to inclusivity is one of its most powerful features, and it has played a pivotal role in fostering unity among India's people.\n\nThe Constitution ensures that every citizen, regardless of religion, caste, or gender, has the right to equal treatment before the law. It also protects the rights of marginalised groups, ensuring that they have the opportunities and resources needed to thrive in society. Through provisions like the abolition of untouchability, the reservation system, and special safeguards for religious and cultural minorities, the Constitution promotes a society that values and celebrates diversity.\n\nFamous Quotes on the Constitution\n\n\"Liberty, equality, and fraternity are not to be treated as separate items in a trinity. They form a union of trinity in the sense that to divorce one from the other is to defeat the very purpose of democracy.\" - Dr BR Ambedkar\n\n\"A Constitution is not merely a document in black and white. It is a living document that evolves with the nation.\" - Justice PN Bhagwati\n\n\"The will of the people is the only legitimate foundation of any government, and to protect its free expression should be our first object.\" - Dr Rajendra Prasad\n\n\"Democracy is not merely a form of government. It is primarily a mode of associated living, of conjoint communicated experience.\" - Dr BR Ambedkar\n\n\"The greatness of a nation lies in its fidelity to its Constitution and its adherence to the rule of law.\" - Pranab Mukherjee\n\n\"The Constitution gives us the freedom to dream big and work towards achieving those dreams.\" - Narendra Modi"

Despite the MVA's aggressive campaign and the controversy surrounding a cash-for-votes scandal on the eve of polling, the electorate appears to have overwhelmingly favoured the MahaYuti alliance.\n\nThe BJP's dominant strike rate is seen as a clear endorsement of its governance and campaign strategy, delivering a significant blow to the opposition's efforts to counter its narrative."

        "content": "Sufism, often referred to as Islamic mysticism, (1) is a spiritual path guided by masters that focuses on the purification of the soul and internal transformation. It emphasizes deepening one's inner vision to transcend worldly illusions and achieve a certain spiritual certainty. Sufis believe in the importance of inner exploration to connect with the divine, which often involves practices aimed at enhancing self-awareness and spiritual elevation. (2)\n\nIslam was born in the desert, and all its spirituality and theology are based on purification. (3) Its profession of faith, which begins with a negation ('No divinity but God'), prefigures all its ethics/aesthetics of pared-down form: simplicity of dogma and rituals, rejection of material supports that imply a vision of a finite world (statues, figurative art, etc.). God is known through emptiness, because emptiness is fullness. Sufism is a living path of initiation. The wisdom that animates it is not a theoretical philosophy; it is a unifying, and transforming practice. (4)\n\nSufism, which emerged during the dawn of Islam in the 8 century, represents the spiritual and esoteric dimension of the Qur'ânic revelation. It emphasizes inner exploration and the development of internal forces through meditation, love, and the pursuit of divine knowledge. Practitioners seek a deeper connection with God and often engage in rituals and practices that aim to cultivate their spiritual awareness and moral character. (5)\n\nSufism (in Arabic: ٱلتَّصَوُّف, at-taṣawwuf) refers to the esoteric and mystical practices of Islam aimed at the \"purification of the soul\" in order to \"get closer\" to God. (6) It is a path of spiritual elevation, an initiatory path of inner transformation, which transcends the formalism of fundamentalists and other proponents of a rigorous Islam. It claims to be the \"heart\" of Islam. (7) It is generally practiced through an initiation within a tarîqah, (8) a term which designates, by extension, a brotherhood gathering the faithful around a spiritual master.\n\nSufism finds its foundations in the Qur'ânic revelation and in the example of Muhammad. It can therefore be said that it has been present, since the origins of the prophetic revelation of Islam, in the Sunni and Shiite branches, although it has taken different forms in both cases. (9)\n\nSufism refers to what Islam calls \"ihsân\" (excellence): the fact of worshiping God as if one were seeing him. That is to say, Sufism has the ultimate goal of opening the \"heart\" of the initiate to the beatific vision, to the suprarational and unitive knowledge of the divine Principle. This differentiates it from the profane sciences, which are based on efforts of thought. The realized being obtains his science directly by unveiling and vision. (10)\n\nSufism is the inner dimension of Sunni Islam. With its roots in the Qur'rân and Prophetic Tradition, it has often been defined as the 'science of spiritual states', the mastery of which should enable the initiate to transcend his or her ego and attain knowledge and contemplation of God. Fundamentally, the Sufi aspires to draw on the spiritual influx of the Prophet Muhammad, transmitted for centuries from master to disciple, which will enable him to combat the passions and illusions that beset him.\n\nThroughout time, certain ulama (11) and scholars have spoken out against what they have called the \"excesses\" of Sufism. They have expressed criticism, both on the doctrine of certain brotherhoods and on their practices. Today, Salafism and Wahhabism are totally opposed to Sufi practices. (12)\n\nIn his introduction of Sufism Eric Geoffroy writes: (13)\n\n\"Sufism is an aspect of eternal, universal wisdom that was embodied in the body of the Islamic religion, which originated in Arabia in the sixth century. It can be defined as the inner, spiritual dimension of Islam, and essentially of Sunni Islam.\n\nOf the various meanings given to the term sûfî, two are linguistically plausible. The first, immaterial, derives from the Arabic verb sûfiya, 'he has been purified'. The aim of Sufism would therefore be to return man to his original purity, to the state where he was not yet differentiated from the spiritual world. According to the second etymology, the word sûfî derives from the word sûf, wool.\n\nSufism developed in a Sunni climate, because it is based on the internalisation of the Muhammadan model, the Sunna. The fundamental relationship between master and disciple only makes sense in reference to the Prophet, the 'Master of masters', and every Sufi order finds its legitimacy in the 'initiatory chain' that goes back to him. Muslim saints are therefore nourished by the blessed influence (baraka) of the one who is for them 'the perfect Man'.\"\n\nIt's often said that Sufism is a flavour, (14) and that you can only understand it by tasting it. (15) It is dhawq (taste, tasting), a central concept in Sufism, derived from the Qurʾān and developed over several centuries, which has several interrelated meanings. (16) The Muslim meditation session is a shared moment of Sufi practice, based primarily on the invocation of divine names aloud and spiritual chanting. For the disciple, the spiritual influx conveyed by these invocations gradually purifies the heart, illuminating it and eventually setting it ablaze, leaving only unconditional love and divine oneness at the end of the journey. From the exoteric to the esoteric, beings come to grasp their ontological structures, in other words, to define themselves. (17)\n\nSufism is clearly a logic that can reveal the luminous side of Islam, which is not just a dogma but also a religion of love, (18) far from literal readings. Sufism can deconstruct amply the stereotypes associated with Islam. Sufism, known as the mystical dimension of Islam, emphasizes a spiritual path that seeks the deeper meanings of divine revelation and the hidden mysteries within the faith. It highlights the luminous, transformative aspects of Islam, focusing on inner experience and personal connection with the divine, in contrast to more normative interpretations of the religion.\n\nDialogue is created through understanding and compromise. Islam should not be understood as a law, but as a culture of love and dialogue. It is inescapable that Sufism, as a shortcut to God, is one of the faces of moderate Islam. Mysticism explains the infinite richness of Islamic civilisation. The Sufi heritage expresses the desire to affirm an open and harmonious world. (19)\n\nOn the importance and relevance of mysticism in Islam, Mehdi Aminrazavi points out that: (20)\n\n\"Ghazzālī is one of the few mystics whose brand of Sufism embraces religious orthodoxy, a gnostic intellectual framework, and the more practical and ascetic dimension of the spiritual path. Contrary to the antinomian Sufis, who violated the Islamic law (Shari'ah) and the more relaxed attitude of some of the other Sufis, Ghazzālī was an austere and ardent observer of Islamic law.\n\nHe wrote extensively on mysticism, arguing it to be the only right path to truth. A notable piece among his writings on mysticism is The Niche of Light (Mishkāt al-anwār), a significant work of an illuminationist nature and one that influenced the formation of the doctrine of illumination (ishrāq) by Suhrawardī (Aminrazavi 1996). Also, parts of his Magnum Opus, Revival of Religious Sciences (Iḥyā' al-'ulūm al-dīnī), such as book thirty-five of the Iḥyā': The Book of Faith in Divine Unity and Trust in Divine Providence, are essentially devoted to an explication of the Sufi doctrine. He also has written numerous shorter commentaries on the spiritual significance of fasting, praying, invocation of divine names and attributes, and spiritual music as instruments of the catharsis of the soul.\"\n\nBearing in mind that al-Ghazâlî was an open opponent to philosophy which he considered a science that negated religion and the existence of God directly or indirectly. (21)\n\nMysticism in Islam was born in the century following the death of the Prophet. Perhaps influenced, at its origin, by Christian hermits, it developed considerably over time, giving rise to a significant literature in verse and prose. Its followers were quickly given the name of Sufi, probably in reference to the coarse wool (sûf) with which they dressed. Other etymologies have been considered: a derivation from the Greek word sophos (\"wisdom\"), or from the Arabic safâ' (\"purity\"), but they are generally rejected by researchers. (22)\n\nEvery religion has a mysticism, a religious current that seeks direct contact with the divine: Sufism predominates in Islam. Sufi practices were developed and organised between the eleventh and twelfth centuries, rooted in a theory of the world, man and God that was gradually established by a number of theologians. Sufism is defined by an esoteric conception of man's relationship with the world and the divine, but also by very specific practices, including the importance of initiation rites, especially from the time of its institutionalisation in the twelfth century in what are known as the Sufi \"ways\". Beyond these internal characteristics, Sufism quickly established itself as a social force in its own right, playing an important role in the history of Muslim countries from both a social and political point of view, and still retaining a real influence today, in some countries at least. (23)\n\nUnlike scholars, who seek to reach God through the study of the Koran and religious texts, Sufis claim their ignorance. Their goal is to obtain knowledge of God not through the intellect, but through personal and intimate experience, to the point of becoming one with the Creator. One of the greatest Sufi masters, al-Hallâj, proclaimed in the streets of Baghdad, \"I am the absolute truth,\" namely God himself; others wrote love poems, in Arabic or Persian, where the description of the beloved corresponds to that of the divinity. (24)\n\nFor Eric Geoffroy, there are three main levels to the Islamic religion: (25)\n\n\"There are three dimensions to the Islamic religion: theological, legal and spiritual. Sufism is defined as this third, inner dimension of Islam. For a Sufi - in Arabic sūfī, plural sūfiyyūn - Sufism is seen as an aspect of eternal, universal wisdom, and as such has existed since Adam. It was embodied in the body of the Islamic religion, which was born in Arabia in the 7th century. The etymology of the term, which appeared towards the end of the second century of the Hegira, remains obscure. The Arabic word tasawwuf, literally 'the adoption of Sufi values and rites', is based on the word sūfī, which has been translated into French as 'soufisme'.\"\n\nIn order to attain knowledge and love of God, Sufis must travel a path punctuated by several stages - seven, in general, among which are poverty, patience, fear, satisfaction, trust in God. To do this, they practice asceticism, meditation, spiritual retreat, often for forty days. Like the mystics (26) of other religions, they also devote themselves to the tireless chanting of the name of God and the profession of Muslim faith: it is perhaps through them that the rosary, originally used in India, arrived in the West. (27) That of Muslim mystics has ninety-nine balls, each of which corresponds to one of the names of God present in the Koran.\n\nSufism is never practiced alone: the one who aspires to it, the murid, must be taken care of by a master, the shaikh, who takes care of his spiritual training. This relationship between the master and the student allows the perpetuation of a chain of initiatory transmission, which always goes back to Muhammad. Generally, a shaikh has several disciples, who come together in a brotherhood and practice meditation and asceticism exercises together. One of the best known is that of the Mevlevi, or \"whirling dervishes\", which was born in Konya, in present-day Turkey, in the 13 century. (28)\n\nThe valorization of dance, music, sensuality, and even drink among these pious characters is justified, in their eyes, by their desire to know God not in the letter of the Koran, but in the spirit. It is noted that Sufism often gives pride of place to women: according to one of the main Sufi masters, Ibn Arabi (29) (1165-1240), (30) they have the same ability to achieve sainthood as men. Among the first followers of mysticism, we find the poet Rabia al-Adawiyya (circa 713-801), (31) who inspired the famous Egyptian singer Oum Kalsoum eleven centuries later.\n\nNevertheless, Sufism has often been considered subversive and lacking in the principles of Islam by religious authorities. As early as the 10 century, al-Hallâj, for example, was publicly executed. Today, the practice of Sufism is condemned in Saudi Arabia, often poorly accepted in North Africa, and violently rejected by Islamist movements. However, it attracts many young Muslims around the world in search of spiritual renewal.\n\nHusayn ibn Mansûr al-Hallâj was a great Sunni Sufi who lived at the turn of the tenth century (around 858-922). (32) He had the distinction of saying out loud what others preached in hushed tones. For various reasons, Hallâj did not get along with the Sufi milieu of his time. He quickly abandoned it and began to preach \"freelance\", so to speak, in the souks and mosques. He socialised with Jews and Christians, and talked about mysticism to anyone who would listen. His style of preaching was totally different from that of other Sufis, who usually gathered in small, discreet or even clandestine groups. Al-Hallâj travelled everywhere, in Iran, India and Arabia. He acquired enormous prestige, thousands of disciples claimed him as their own, and many miracles were attributed to him. And this annoyed the authorities to no end. He was imprisoned in 913 and remained there until 922, when he was put to death in Baghdad [then under the Abbasid caliphate].\n\nIn 264/977, al-Hallâj met Junayd (33) and practiced spiritual exercises under his direction. He received the Khirqa (the Sufi mantle) from the hands of the master. But on his first pilgrimage to Mecca, he broke off his relations with the Sufis as well as with the traditionalists and the jurists.\n\nThe union with God achieved through love was the subject of his public preaching in Baghdad. The canonists conceived a lot of anger and accused him of pantheism. The Sufis did not support him on the pretext that he had divulged secrets that should only be communicated to the initiated. Hallaj had committed the fault of publicly breaking \"the discipline of the arcane\". The politicians and the jurists demanded a fatwa to send him to the gallows. He was put to death on a spring day in the year 922, the 24th of Du'l-Qa'da.\n\nBut whatever its immediate effects, his martyrdom ultimately proved to be a source of strength for the status of the mystics and for mysticism itself within the community as a whole.\n\nThe verdict that no one had the right to utter such words: \"ana al-haq\" (I am the Truth) was gradually forgotten in favour of a view that it was not the man in this case who was speaking, and now for a growing number of Muslims the condemned formula is itself primarily an important piece of evidence that al-Hallâj was one of the greatest saints of Islam, while at the same time it serves as a general demonstration of the fact that Sufis are not always responsible for what they express. (34)\n\nFor mystics like al-Hallâj and his colleagues, it is possible to have an experience of God on Earth. There is the possibility of contact through the heart - which is considered suspect. In Islam, everything depends on the testimony of the prophet Muhammad, who revealed the Qur'ân and delivered the hadith. If there are mystics who claim to be in touch with the source of revelation, it's a bit like putting themselves in competition with the prophet. In fact, Sufis do not do this, but they are easily branded heretics.\n\nSufis profess union with God here below. In this configuration, what happens to the Judgement and the Resurrection? This suggests that they already see themselves as eternal in God: the Last Judgement therefore loses its meaning. Another delicate point concerns divine love, an idea they profess against the text of the Qur'ân. For classical Muslim theologians, God can be merciful, he can be good to human beings, he can deliver benefits, but there cannot be a feeling of love between humans and God - in either direction - because they are of too different a nature, incommensurable. Yet in his poetry, and in particular in his diwân [poetic collection], al-Hallâj teaches this love of God, which is considered reprehensible by theologians. (35)\n\nGenerally speaking, al-Hallâj was convinced that, in the face of God, human beings were illusory and that they owed God everything - their bodies, their minds and their ability to say 'I'. The Sufi experience as he understood it was one of annihilation in God. The human being is thought of as a mirror in which God is reflected. The divine \"I\" is therefore reflected through the mirror of humanity. Communication with God takes place paradoxically in the name of the annihilation of their person. (36)\n\nAfter al-Hallâj's execution, the Sufis realised that they had to be careful. A sort of modus vivendi was established over the centuries, namely that if the Sufis kept to themselves and did not preach publicly, they could have the experiences they wanted of extinction in God, without being persecuted. But they had to keep quiet and recognise political or legalistic power as the official power. This is the model that persists today, albeit in very different ways in different geographical areas. In Saudi Arabia, for example, they are still persecuted by the Wahhabi authorities, who tolerate only Sharî'ah law and exclude Sufis. Sufis are accepted and identified in countries such as Egypt, where there is a ministry responsible for registering them. Senegal is another example, where more than half the population belongs to Sufi orders. And in other countries, such as Morocco, the government is even trying to support Sufi brotherhoods as a counterweight to fundamentalist Muslims.\n\nWahhabism (37) and Sufism represent two distinct approaches within Islam. Wahhabism, often associated with a strict interpretation of Islamic doctrine, emphasizes a return to the fundamentals of Islam and rejects practices seen as innovations or deviations (bid'ah), including Sufism. This movement prioritizes a literal interpretation of the Qur'an and Hadith, focusing on monotheism and strict adherence to traditional teachings.\n\nIn contrast, Sufism emphasizes the inner, spiritual dimensions of faith, advocating for personal experiences of the divine through practices such as meditation, poetry, and music. Sufis often seek a deeper emotional and mystical connection to God, and their practices are generally viewed as foreign by Wahhabi followers, who see them as straying from the principle of tawhid (the oneness of God).\n\nBoth groups thus hold opposing views regarding religious practice, with Wahhabism rejecting Sufi customs due to their perception as innovations. (38)\n\nSufism, the mystical branch of Islam, significantly influences Islamic culture through its emphasis on personal spiritual experience, love for God, and community values. It promotes practices such as meditation and prayer to seek truth and closeness to God. Sufi traditions also blend elements from various other religions, including Jewish mysticism and Hinduism, contributing to a rich tapestry of cultural expressions. The engagement of Sufis often reflects in public displays of piety, such as veiling and traditional attire, influencing broader societal norms within the Islamic community. (39)\n\nThe influence of Sufism on Islamic culture is profound and multi-faceted. Sufism, which can be understood as a mystical dimension of Islam, emphasizes personal spirituality and the inner experience of God. This has led to the development of various artistic expressions, including poetry, music, and dance, that reflect its spiritual themes. Notable Sufi poets like Rumi (1207-1273) and Hafez (1325-1389/1390) have made significant contributions to literature, while Sufi rituals and practices have enriched religious life in both Sunni and Shia traditions. Additionally, Sufism has fostered a sense of community and tolerance within the broader Islamic culture, often serving as a unifying force across different sects and practices. (40)\n\nFrom the thirteenth century onwards, Sufism was no longer a marginal phenomenon; in fact, it became the dominant trend in Sunni Islamic culture, single-handedly energising spiritual, intellectual and artistic life. Attracting more and more followers, it reoriented piety and religious life.\n\nSufism has significantly influenced Islamic culture through its emphasis on personal experiences of God, which has led to rich traditions in poetry, music, and dance. Rooted in the Qur'ân and the example of the Prophet Muhammad, it encourages a deeper spiritual connection rather than just adherence to religious law. Over time, it has developed a vast body of literature and has integrated various cultural elements enriching the Islamic practice and thought. (41)\n\nSufism has profoundly influenced Islamic art and literature in several ways. Sufi poets like Rumi, (42) Hafez, (43) and Ibn Arabi used poetry to express their mystical experiences and thoughts about the divine. Their works often explore themes of love, unity, and the search for God. Sufi poetry employs rich symbolism and metaphors, such as the beloved representing the divine, leading to emotional and spiritual depth.\n\nOn the relevance of Sufism in today's Muslim world, Marcia Hermansen writes: (44)\n\n\"However, expectations that Sufism is on the wane are challenged by observations of how Sufis have adapted to changing circumstances in modernity, both in Muslim-majority societies and in the West. For example, some scholars document a Sufi renewal involving the rise of charismatic teachers and practices and the reach of new global networks. Sufi teachings are promoted through Internet sites and social media, while today's Sufi teachers may draw on 20th century Western psychological frameworks to explain the spiritual and therapeutic impact of Sufi practices on individuals. Meanwhile Sufi ideas are disseminated to broader publics through music videos, conferences, and other cultural events, such that Sufism in these new configurations continues to inspire significant, if more diffuse, loyalties, both locally and globally. In an age of networking and social mobility, flows of individuals and ideas have created new transnational spheres for the influence and impact of Sufism. At the same time local conditions vary considerably in shaping its diverse contemporary expressions and adaptations.\"\n\nThe intricate design of Arabic calligraphy, (45) often used in Sufi texts, reflects the beauty and spirituality of the written word. Sufi writings are frequently depicted in art, emphasizing their importance. Many Sufi themes and stories were illustrated in Persian and Mughal miniature paintings, showcasing the beauty of Sufi narratives and teachings.\n\nThe Sufi practice of samâ', or ritual listening, (46) often involves music and dance as a means to achieve spiritual ecstasy. The whirling dervishes of the Mevlevi Order are a notable example of this. The development of musical traditions, such as Qawwali in South Asia, (47) draws on Sufi themes, facilitating spiritual expression and connection through sound. (48)\n\nThe architectural style of Sufi shrines often blends various cultural influences, creating spaces meant for contemplation and spiritual gathering. These shrines are often adorned with decorative arts reflecting Sufi themes.\n\nSufi thinkers like al-Ghazali (1058-1111) (49) and Ibn Arabi contributed to Islamic philosophy, blending Sufi concepts with Islamic theology, impacting not only religious thought but also broader philosophical discourse.\n\nOverall, Sufism's emphasis on personal experience and the quest for divine love has enriched Islamic art and literature, resulting in a diverse and vibrant cultural expression that resonates across time and geography.\n\nSufism has played a significant role in cultural exchanges throughout history, particularly due to its emphasis on spirituality, inner experience, and universal values. Here are some key ways in which Sufism facilitated cultural exchange:\n\nSufi teachings often focus on the commonalities among religions, promoting understanding and respect between different faiths. Sufi masters engaged in dialogues with followers of various religions, fostering mutual appreciation.\n\nSufism has greatly influenced poetry, music, and art across different cultures. Sufi poets like Rumi and Hafez transcended cultural boundaries, inspiring artists, musicians, and writers in various traditions, blending themes of love, devotion, and the search for the Divine.\n\nSufi music is a genre that is deeply rooted in the spiritual traditions of Islam, often characterized by its mystical and devotional themes. It is performed across the Islamic world and includes various styles, instruments, and cultural expressions. Traditional Sufi music aims to inspire spiritual ecstasy and connection to the divine, frequently featuring singing, poetry, and instrumental accompaniment. Popular platforms like Spotify offer compilations and collections of Sufi music, (50) showcasing both contemporary and traditional performances. (51)\n\nSufi music holds significant relevance as it serves as a means to purify the soul and foster a direct connection with the divine. Through immersive practices like samâ', which includes music, song, and dance, Sufi music (52) creates a spiritual atmosphere conducive for experiencing closeness to love and divinity. Additionally, it is believed to possess healing properties, promoting emotional and spiritual well-being by addressing negative energies and enhancing mental health. (53)\n\nSufi ascetics and scholars often traveled widely, especially through trade routes. They not only spread Islamic teachings but also absorbed local customs and spiritual practices, creating a rich tapestry of cultural exchange.\n\nSufi orders often engaged in missionary work, (54) introducing Islamic thought to new regions while adapting to local beliefs and practices, thus facilitating an exchange between Islamic and indigenous cultures.\n\nSufi philosophers interacted with other philosophical traditions -- such as Neoplatonism, Hinduism, and Buddhism -- leading to the cross-pollination of ideas that enriched both Islamic and non-Islamic thoughts.\n\nSufi practices often emphasized social justice, equality, and unity. This engaged various social groups, encouraging cooperation between diverse communities in places where Sufism was practiced.\n\nThrough these avenues and many others, Sufism has been a powerful conduit for cultural exchange, promoting a sense of shared humanity and spiritual exploration across diverse religious and cultural landscapes.\n\nSufism, or Tasawwuf, is often viewed as a spiritual dimension of Islam that emphasizes the inward search for God and the cultivation of spiritual knowledge and experience. Although the term \"Sufism\" does not appear in the Qur'ân, its principles are reflected in various verses that encourage deeper faith, love of God, and the pursuit of purity of the heart. Sufism serves the monotheistic vision of Islam by emphasizing spiritual practices such as remembrance (dhikr) and meditation, aiming to connect the individual deeply with the divine. (55)\n\nIn the profusion of currents of wisdom that have emerged in Islamic culture, Sufism presents itself as the \"way of the heart\". The \"heart\" is for the Sufis this faculty which, beyond intellectual speculations, beyond devout practices, allows man to grasp the vibration of the Being in the flow of life, and to commune with it in an indescribable way. Initiatory practices proposed by the Sufi brotherhoods (turuq, the \"ways\") aim to gradually purify the heart of the applicant, to free him from the hypnosis of daily life and his passions, to make him receptive to the inner or outer calls revealing to him the meaning of his pilgrimage on earth. These practices are very diverse: repetition of litanies in a loud or quiet voice, silent meditations, collective worship more or less extroverted according to the brotherhoods and cultural circles, songs, music, sometimes dances. (56)\n\nA follower of the mystical path of Islam, the Sufi explores the hidden meanings of the Qur'rân and uses techniques of meditation, asceticism, ecstatic song and dance to approach Allah.\n\nHistorically, this Sufi impulse has deeply and lastingly permeated the culture of Muslim societies. Some of the most eminent figures have taken part in it: the great theologian al-Ghazali (d. 1111), a poet of genius like Rumi (d. 1258) (57) the Emir Abd el-Kader in Algeria in the 19 century. (58) It manifested itself in poetic expression and lyricism, and gave to the poetry of different languages in use some of its most brilliant masterpieces; Turkish and especially Persian poetry are indebted to it for an inspiration that continues to this day (themes of love, wine, beauty in general as supernatural revelations). (59) It permeates music and even sacred choreographies, whether in the hieratic purity of Mevlevi ceremonies (whirling dervishes), in the moving spontaneity of more popular cults, or even ceremonies inducing real trances. He left his mark on arts as diverse as architecture and calligraphy. Some great masters, such as Ibn Arabi, (60) devoted themselves to a dizzying exploration of human language in an uninterrupted meditation on sacred texts: it is through his Word that God created the universe and man, it is in the sacred language that the Sufi can reveal the secret of his own aspiration.\n\nMore generally, the Sufi brotherhoods exercised considerable social influence, especially from the 12 century onwards. They were led to manage hospices and schools, and their convents became important places of meeting and exchange. They spread an ideal of \"spiritual chivalry\", of inner combat as well as religious attitudes within the reach of believers immersed in ordinary life. But, victims of their own success, they were also led to play an important political role, with all the compromises that this sometimes entailed. Since the 19 century, they have been attacked simultaneously by conservative reformist currents (Wahhabism) who see heresy in them, and by progressives who accuse them of obscurantism. (61) Nevertheless, the Sufi orders continue to follow the path of the heart to this day, considering themselves precisely as \"the heart of Islam\". (62) (63)\n\nAs the Sufi masters have always affirmed, before building or rebuilding the spiritual authenticity of human beings, we must first deconstruct the illusions they conceal. This applies a priori to our perception of Sufism, which is subject to so many prejudices: before embarking on this path, we must first consider what Sufism is and what it is not, in other words, understand its foundations and objectives.\n\nIn fairly unstructured Muslim societies, the lack of reference points can make you dizzy. Many have been deeply wounded by established religions, which one has experienced as shackles and even traumas. So, one needs to work on restoring psychic and mental balance. In this sense, Sufism has more of a therapeutic role than ever, because its initiatory path necessarily involves a process of personal psychological deconditioning. This involves \"dis-identifying\", getting rid of all false identities (egotistical, family, social, political, professional, even religious...), which cause to suffer and lead some to dramatic impasses. In this way, one releases an inner freedom that one never suspected existed within, and one recovers metaphysical identity, one's \"original homeland\".\n\nThe entire framework of Islam is based on the attestation of the Oneness of God, Tawhîd. But what does recognising this Oneness imply? By following a gradual process of interiorisation, one is led to move from a still external, and therefore dualistic, perception of Oneness ('I' and Tawhîd, 'I' and God), to its inner, experiential, unifying understanding. Reintegrating Oneness involves overcoming the contradictions and paradoxes inherent in human nature. This experience requires accompaniment: 'Tawhîd is like fire: it does not invest a thing without burning it, and driving out of it its impurities.\n\nDoesn't the initiatory process of Sufism boil down to transmuting the exoteric testimony of Islam (shahâda) into direct, gustatory contemplation (mushâhada) of spiritual realities? One is helped in this operation by one's inner witness (shâhid). But as spiritual awareness develops, one realises that the true witness within is Him!\n\nThe absence of meaning, or nihilism, affects the West and the East today, manifesting powerful symptoms such as consumerism and the techno-scientific headlong rush of the Western type. This leads to the negation of the human, and this aberration requires a powerful medication: a conscious and responsible spirituality.\n\nSpirituality is about the things of the Spirit; it means that the material, sensible world must be understood and governed from the spiritual or metaphysical world. All authentic religions therefore establish the pre-eminence of the spirit over matter. Islam is not an ideology, but a spiritual breath.\n\nReality cannot be reduced to appearances. In the Qur'ân (57:3), God presents Himself as both the Exterior (al-zâhir) and the Interior (al-bâtin). Now, creation is in the image of God: behind the world of forms, dogma and Law, there is an inner Reality (haqîqah) that represents the foundation of religion and gives it its true meaning. It is this reality that the Sufi tends to perceive, starting from the outer or peripheral norm (sharî'ah), and then progressing along the initiatory Path (tarîqah) that links the appearance to the essence. (65)\n\nThis introspective process is outlined in the Qur'ân, particularly in 51: 20-21: (66)\n\n\"On earth there are signs for those who have clear vision. And do you not see within yourselves?\"\n\nThe outside comes from the inside, just as the rind of a fruit envelops the stone. Yet most of the time we live in a superficial, distracted consciousness. So, we need to go in search of our inner selves, the better to realise our humanity!\n\nWith its roots in the Qur'ân and Prophetic Tradition, Sufism is a science of taste, a discipline that enables the human soul to work on its ego. Sufis draw on the spiritual influence of the Prophet, transmitted for centuries from master to disciple, to overcome the passions and illusions that beset them.\n\nThe Sufi does not reject the world: he \"marries\" it in order to transcend it! The Qur'ân (41: 53) urges us to decipher the \"signs\" (al-âyât), to contemplate God in His manifestation, in the beauty of the world:\n\n\"We will show them Our signs in the universe and in themselves until they see that [God] is the Real.\"\n\nThe Sufi is a person who has completed a spiritual journey, who is fulfilled in God, in a word, a saint: no Sufi disciple can apply such a name to himself. That said, to simplify the discussion the term Sufi is used to indicate the disciples of Sufism, although more precise terms are faqîr (poor), tâlib (student), murîd (one who desires), salîk (one who is on the way), dervish (beggar). The main individual and collective rite of Sufism is dhikr, the invocation of divine names, which can be recited aloud or in silence, or manifested in ecstatic dances. The barakah is the supernatural power, energy and blessing that circulates between the master and his disciples.\n\nThe Sufi spiritual journey represents a profound quest for knowledge of oneself and the Universe, rooted in the mystical dimension of Islam. Sufism is seen as the education of the soul, seeking to soothe consciences and awaken a sense of universality, thus promoting an enriching social life.\n\nVoyaging in Sufism involves an exploration of the spiritual dimensions of Islam, emphasising the journey of the soul. In countries like Iran and Turkey, travellers can immerse themselves in Sufi practices, engage in deep contemplation, and connect with the essence of being. This journey serves not just as physical travel but as a means to understand one's inner self and uncover human character.\n\nFor the Sufis, the usefulness of travel lies in the fact that it is an effective means of revealing the characteristics of the human being. For them, in proximity and distance, there is no question of distance; the human being is in a state of incessant immobility, because existence is synonymous with movement.\n\nIslam loudly proclaims its fidelity to the purest of monotheisms, rejecting paganism and the Christian Trinity outright: Surah Ikhlas, 112, of the Qur'ân:\n\n\"Say: God is one. He is the eternal God. He neither gave birth nor was given birth. He has no equal.\"\n\nMuslim mysticism (Sufism) follows this path, and professes the unity and glory of the one God (tawhîd). As an introspective quest, Sufism seeks to go beyond the Qur'ân, on the one hand by encouraging an in-depth reading of the text that would complete the apparent meaning of its verses and reveal their hidden meaning. On the other hand, by proposing techniques of purification and contemplation (in imitation of the Prophet Mohammed, who withdrew to pray in a cave) and specific rituals.\n\nReligions do not have the same conception of God. The Christian Trinitarian God is not that of the Qur'ân or the Torah and the personal God of the three monotheistic religions is not Brahman, the impersonal Absolute of Hinduism which coexists with thousands of gods from which they are the emanation; while Buddhism is a religion without God, although fertile in deities. These different perceptions of the divine and the religious traditions they have created have been conditioned by the history, culture and language of the countries where they were born. That said, beyond these differences, all religions worship the same divine reality, but each in its own way. And there is a kinship between the paths of the Neoplatonic, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Taoist or Buddhist mystics. (67)\n\nRepresenting the highest form of spirituality, mysticism is a personal quest for the hidden God who resides in the heart of each person through the practice of asceticism aimed at detaching oneself from the world. For Plotinus, a Neoplatonic mystical philosopher, man belongs through his body to illusory matter but he is through his soul a fragment of the supreme intellect and the creative logos. Salvation for him can only result from the recognition of his true nature which is only accessible if one manages to rise above the sensitive condition to ecstasy, an encounter with the divine, the source of all bliss towards which the soul merges after having purified itself. (68)\n\nBoth a philosophy and a method of deliverance allowing one to escape the cycle of reincarnations, yoga plays a central role in Hinduism. Submission of the body for a spiritual purpose, it sets out the path of the yogi in eight stages at the end of which he rediscovers his identity with Brahman, which in itself constitutes the supreme deliverance. For the philosophical school of Vedanta, the self (atman) is of the same nature as Brahman, the ultimate undifferentiated reality. It advocates the theory of absolute oneness and the equivalence of all religions. Its greatest master, Ramakrishna, declared that he had reached the Absolute through each of the great mystical traditions, thus indicating that for him, all paths lead to the same reality, one and inexpressible. One of his paths being Zen Buddhism which leads to awakening through meditation sitting in the posture of Buddha. Taoism is a religious and mystical philosophical doctrine that conceives of the Tao as a cosmological principle, and a suprasensible and ineffable absolute that can be accessed through techniques of breath control and concentration, the first step in a long process including an increasingly demanding asceticism. (69)\n\nIn Judaism, Kabbalah is an esoteric and mystical movement aimed at deciphering the book of the creation of the world by the unknowable God. (70) In the West, Christians were slower to develop a mystical tradition compared to the Byzantines and Muslims. Meister Eckhart developed a metaphysical mysticism advocating a detachment from everything that is not God. For him, it is about allowing man to become by grace what God is by nature. The mystical and contemplative part of religion is greater in Orthodoxy than in Catholicism. Orthodox mysticism traces its origins to the experience of the Desert Fathers of the purification of the soul through prayer of the heart allowing communion with God in solitude. A great figure of monastic spirituality, Saint John Climacus (71) formulated the doctrine of hesychasm: perpetual prayer of the soul devoted to contemplation, far from the world, in silence. From there, one can achieve perfect indifference to earthly things, it is the ultimate degree before union with God. (72)\n\nMuslim mysticism, Sufism, is influenced by Christian monasticism, Persian illuminism, (73) Hindu ecstasy and Jewish Kabbalah. The spiritual state of baqâ' (pure \"subsistence\" outside of all form), to which Sufi contemplatives aspire, is the same as the state of moskha, the deliverance spoken of in Hindu doctrines, as the extinction (al-fanâ') of individuality, which precedes \"subsistence\" is analogous to nirvana. Just as in Buddhism, one rises by degrees to the highest points of the annihilation of individuality by following a path composed of eight parts, the \"noble path\", so Sufism also has its path, its tarîqah, with degrees of perfection. It aims to personally relive by the mystical way (tarîqah) the spiritual truth of the message of the Prophet, beyond the literal given of revelation (shari'ah). It represents the esoteric aspect of Islam, distinct from the exoteric in the same way that direct contemplation of spiritual - or divine - realities is distinct from the observance of laws. Love plays a central role in the teachings of the Sufi masters, who consider the spiritual station associated with it to be one of the most insignificant of all.\n\nAnother element common to all Sufis is dhikr/zikr or 'invocation', which consists of remembering God, in particular by repeating his name rhythmically or according to traditional formulas taken from the Qur'ân, such as the shahâdah. dhikr/zikr is considered to be a practice that purifies the soul, because the name of Allah is considered to have a kind of theurgic value that is mystically ardent, Ibn Arabi developed a metaphysical doctrine based on the absolute uniqueness of being \"wahdat al -woujoud\", which is in line with Neoplatonic philosophical monism and the Hindu doctrine of non-duality between the Whole, Brahman, and the individual, as expressed in the mantra \"tat vam asi\" (\"this is you\").\n\nSufism is seen as a bridge between religions and cultures, a privileged ambassador to the West. Sufism, which presents itself as the free \"variant\" of Islam, has always been a source of enthusiasm, but also of controversy. Sometimes taking different paths to achieve the same goal: love of the Creator and of creation, religion and discipline complement and regenerate each other. (74)\n\nSufism serves as a bridge between religions and cultures by emphasizing a universal spiritual core that transcends specific doctrines. It engages with the primary traditions of various faiths, fostering dialogue and understanding. Sufism seeks to illuminate the deeper meanings of religious practices, renewing their significance for followers, and presenting a perspective that appreciates the wisdom found in diverse cultural expressions of spirituality.\n\nIt all began with the spiritual families that emerged in Islam in the 11 and 12 centuries. Specific guidance, initiatory methods and several stages make up the spiritual and educational itinerary of the faithful. In the conditions and events of the time (fall of Baghdad 1258, Mongol invasion ...) (75) that fuelled this spiritual need for a new vision of the world and its vagaries, Sufism was the salvation.\n\nDefined as \"Muslim mysticism\", the essence of Sufism boils down to its ability to pinpoint the divine presence through intuition and contemplation. The main aim of Sufism is to pierce the opacity of this world, in order to contemplate spiritual realities in simple faith. (76)\n\nFrom the 11 century, Sufi masters taught in the madrasas and higher institutes of Baghdad like their counterparts the ulama.\n\nThe precepts of Sufism are published in works and the doctrine is not persecuted by the Orthodox religion. But things will change. Judging that the Sufis go too far in their \"love\" of the divine, \"guardians of religion and law\" begin to persecute them en masse.\n\nAl-Hallaj, who cried out during a moment of spiritual ecstasy, \"I am the Real\" (ana al-haq) was even executed... a martyr of divine love who ends up merging with the divine presence by dint of loving it, this is what he calls \"al-houloul\" (the incarnation).\n\nThe Wahhabis, inveterate disciples of Ibn Taymiyya, persecutor par excellence of the Sufis, reproach them for their brotherhood practices that quickly became popular. In fact, they wanted to take away from Islam its free and intimate side, so venerated by Sufism. The exhibition also draws portraits of the great masters who have shaped Sufism over time.\n\nEach in their own way, they have enriched the doctrine with their spiritual experiences and their respective reflections. Ibn Arabi, (77) Jalal Eddine Rumi, al-Hallaj, al-Ghazali, Rabia al-Adawiyya... different experiences and approaches, different visions, but a single motivation: the love of God, the creator and creation. (78)\n\nDrunkenness, music and dance, holiness, metaphysics of being, spiritual intuition... the paths multiply and differ among the Sufis, but the original essence remains intact and does not lose its appeal.\n\nWhy was the al-Rawda Mosque in Bir al-Abd, located in North Sinai in Egypt, the target of an attack that caused the death of 305 people, including 27 children, on Friday, November 25, 2017? Everything suggests that the fact that it is frequented by Sufi Muslims is the cause of this attack.\n\nIndeed, even if it has not officially claimed responsibility, Daesh hates the supporters of Sufism, which would explain the attack. And which had already led the terrorist group to kill the Sufi preacher Suleiman Abu Harraz in November 2016 near the city of El-Arich, on the grounds that he practiced witchcraft.\n\nMuslim extremists accuse the Sufis, whom they have attacked many times in the past in Egypt and Pakistan, of erasing the distinction - fundamental in Islam - between God and man. Indeed, the declared goal of the Sufi is to immerse oneself in God to the point of becoming one with him. (79)\n\nIn this traditional branch of Islam - both Sunni and Shiite - that is Sufism, its followers seek a personal spiritual path, marked by mystical experiences, elevation, and even asceticism. This Islam of peace, turned towards others, is the antithesis of the warlike Islam advocated by the Islamists who criticize it for its esoteric dimension and its heretical character. (80)\n\nThus, the Iranian Abu Yazid Bistami (died around 875) recounts the dazzling mystical experience he had. \"At the cost of a frenzied asceticism, he begins an initiatory journey and sees his being dialogue with God, reflected in Him to such an extent that there is a substitution of the two persons,\" recounts Éric Geoffroy, a Sufi himself, in a work published on the subject in 2013 by Éditions Eyrolles. (81) And when someone knocks on his door and asks, the great mystic can answer: \"No, there is only God in this house.\" The divine presence has annihilated the ordinary human ego in him.\n\nLike Islam in general, Sufism aims at submission to the will of God and preparation for the expected encounter with him. But, more than other Muslims, Sufis insist on the need to tame the nafs within themselves, the selfish \"I\", frequently compared to a fiery horse, and influenced by Satan.\n\nIn their daily struggle, Sufis rely on a hadith (word attributed to the Prophet) comparing the \"small jihad\", to be waged on the battlefields against the enemies of Islam, with the \"great jihad\", an internal one. It is only once the nafs is mastered that a place is freed up for God in the heart of the believer and that an encounter, a dialogue then becomes possible with him.\n\n\"The Sufi then rises towards this God who is also Absolute, Truth and Unity, going up an inner ladder punctuated by stations (maqam), becoming aware that Creation in its entirety is only a manifestation of the Uncreated. He then tastes the state of annihilation in God,\" writes Thierry Zarcone. (82) A rise sometimes described as \"ecstasy\" or \"trance,\" which can take the form of an attraction \"upward\" or \"inward,\" leading toward God in the form of concentric circles...\n\nSufism was structured from the 12 century in the form of brotherhoods (tarîqah), systematizing the doctrines and experiences of the first \"masters\" (shaykhs): Rabia, Bistami, then Ibn Arabi (died in 1240) and especially Rumi, founder in Konya, Turkey, of the brotherhood of the Mevlevis (or whirling dervishes). The tombs of the saints of the brotherhood are also venerated and become places of pilgrimage or festive gatherings (moussem). Initially elitist, Sufism also became popular, colored by different traditions depending on the regions of the world where it was established. (83)\n\nThe ultimate goal of Sufism is to achieve a state known as fanâʼ, which represents the annihilation of the self in God. This state signifies a profound spiritual union with the divine, where the individual experiences a complete merging with God's essence. Sufis seek this ultimate realization through various spiritual practices, including meditation, prayer, and the remembrance of God (dhikr/zikr).\n\nThe ultimate goal of Sufism, a mystical dimension of Islam, is to achieve spiritual union with God (Allah). Sufis seek to transcend material desires, purify their souls and approach divine truth through love, devotion and spiritual knowledge. This journey involves a process of inner purification, spiritual discipline and deep meditation.\n\nThis is achieved through spiritual practices such as dhikr/zikr (remembrance of God), prayer, meditation, asceticism, and sometimes even musical or dance rituals (such as the whirling dervish dance of the Mevlevi Sufis). The essence of Sufism is to achieve a state of fanâ' (annihilation of the ego) in order to reach the state of baqâ' (permanence in the consciousness of God), where the soul is in harmony with the divine presence. Sufism places great emphasis on divine love, believing that love is the driving force that brings man closer to God, leading him to a profound understanding of the unity of existence.\n\nThe aim of Sufism is to achieve union and closeness with God. This involves a profound inner purification and spiritual transformation, where the individual transcends the ego and merges with the divine essence. Sufis aspire to live in a state of constant spiritual awareness, marked by divine love, inner peace and wisdom.\n\nThis quest for union with God aims to reveal the ultimate truth of existence and to experience the divine presence in every aspect of life. The central idea is to transcend the limitations of the ego and immerse oneself in the love and light of God, leading to an intimate understanding of the unity of all creation.\n\nSufism is a discipline whose ultimate goal is an encounter with the divine in this world. And this encounter is only possible through an accomplishment, an elevation of one's spiritual state. To achieve this elevation, the disciple needs two wings. One is the Law and the other is the Spirit. The Law is everything that is rules, everything that constantly taints and weighs down the soul. The other wing, the Spirit, is spiritual exercises, self-emptying, detachment from matter, a certain asceticism, meditation and contemplation.\n\nDance and song are also used to achieve this elevation. The whirling dance performed by dancers known as Whirling Dervishes (84) is undoubtedly the most astonishing and best-known religious act in the West. Although whirling dervishes perform regularly, their dance is sacred. 'It is an extension of meditation practices. Whirling Dervishes can whirl, sway or hop around, slowly at first and then with increasing speed. These three movements describe those of the angels around the divine throne.\n\nSeekers of truth who wish to follow the path of Sufism must first undergo an initiation. It's an act of allegiance. They take an oath to honour the path. Initiation varies from one order to another.\n\nSufi meditation, also known as mystical meditation, is a spiritual practice aimed at achieving a deep union with God. One specific technique within this practice is called murâqabah, which involves observation or maintaining a spiritual connection through the heart, fostering an ongoing awareness of God's presence. (85)\n\nSufi meditation, or dhik/zikrr, is a spiritual practice focused on the remembrance of God. It often involves repetitive prayer, chanting, or affirmation, and can include techniques like closing the eyes and mouth to enhance concentration. Followers believe that through this meditation, they connect deeply with the divine and cultivate awareness of God's presence. The practice may vary among different Sufi orders, with some influenced by Indian philosophical thoughts. (86)\n\nSufi meditation is an essential spiritual practice that helps practitioners connect more deeply with the divine presence. This meditation, known by various names such as murâqabah (inner observation or spiritual vigilance), involves intense concentration and immersion in the contemplation of God.\n\nThe meditator cultivates a keen awareness of the divine presence within and around him. He focuses on the idea that God is always present and that one must be in constant communion with Him. Through meditation, the Sufi seeks to purify his heart of all distractions, negative thoughts, or worldly attachments. This purification is a step toward spiritual enlightenment. Often, Sufi meditation is accompanied by dhikr/zikr, the ritual repetition of the names of God or phrases such as: la ilâha illallâh (There is no god but God). This chanting or whispering helps to center and channel the mind toward the divine. In quieter forms, the meditator sits in peace, often with eyes closed, to contemplate the nature of God or divine love. Conscious breathing can also be used to quiet the mind and facilitate a deeper spiritual connection.\n\nThe goals of Sufi Meditation are as follows:\n\nTo achieve a state of inner peace and spiritual balance;\n\nSufi meditation is considered a transformative tool, allowing the practitioner to free himself from the illusions of the material world to live in divine consciousness and universal love.\n\nSufism is a mystical Islamic philosophy that emphasises the purification of the soul and self-realisation, aiming to transcend the ego to become a universal man. It draws from various spiritual traditions and has been influenced by Platonic thought, particularly in its philosophical development in the 13 century. Sufism cuts across both Sunni and Shia branches of Islam, promoting a form of wisdom and spirituality that is integral to the Muslim experience.\n\nHumanism represents one of the questions and one of the most important problems that have greatly interested the philosophical discourse at the level of its different doctrines; that which discourse has made the only means of constructing a global conception of existence and the existing, as evidenced by the content of the most important founding texts of Islamic philosophy. These texts have effectively valued the human being considered as the thinking being capable of mentally erecting the world with firmness. Al-Farabi (87) offers an example of this in his volumes \"Arâ' ahl al-madînah all-fâdilah\" and \"Tahsil assa'âdah\". (88)\n\nThe example also comes to us from what Ibn Sina / Avicenne (89) (980-1037) (90) mentions in many places, whether in \"ash-shifa\" or in \"al-Ishârat and al-Tanbîhat\". And if it has been the subject of theological debates between the Al-Mu'atazilah and the al-Ash'airah divided thus between the Creative and the Acquired as for the actions, the humanist current in the Islamic Sufi heritage is no less important in philosophy and theology. In fact, Sufism has granted it great care so much so that the emphasis is placed on the notoriety and the centrality of man on the scale of existence. (91)\n\nThus, if the philosophers and theologians have focused on reason to thus elevate its status by invoking methods of argumentation and proof, the Sufis have then distinguished the human being with many attributes. Besides this need for clarity of mind and fiery insight which is not sufficient, vision can only be righted if it is avoided, and this is a requirement which can only be attained by strengthening the mind with special faculties such as heart, conscience, imagination and taste so that the Self can reach the level of the complete human being who remains the soul of the world. (92)\n\nIt is to this same meaning that Ibn Arabi refers in his work \"Fusūs al-Hikam\" initiated by \"fusadamic\" to thus underline the centrality of man at all levels of physical and metaphysical existence by saying:\n\n\"As soon as the Truth (God) wanted, with regard to his beautiful names that the census cannot reach, to see their essences and if you wanted, you would say \"to see His Essence\" in a globalizing universe that contains everything (al-wujûd) (...), he created the whole world, the perfect ghost-existence without soul; it was like an undisclosed mirror (...) which required the transparency of the mirror of the world so that Adam was the essence of the pure transparency of this mirror and the soul of this image (...) Thus, this remembered [Adam] was called a man and a caliph\". (93)\n\nStarting from the \"Akbarian\" model, it becomes clear that the humanistic Self in Sufi thought is not reduced only to the Self characterized by rational insight, but global reality and an isthmus combining Truth and Creation, Kingship and Kingdom, the Invisible and the Visible. In this regard, it becomes clear that the Sufi humanistic current is not only based on a rational centrality, but rather on the confessional divine unveiling (Shuhūd) based on an existential truth that is expressed at all levels of existence, from the restricted natural existence to the absolute divine existence. Al-Ghazali refers to this in his writing \"Mishkât al-Anwâr\", saying:\n\n\"Then [God] granted His favor to Adam, and He gave him an abbreviated and complete image of all kinds of things in the world, so that it was as if everything in the world, and it is a summary copy of the world. And the image of Adam - I mean this image - is written by the hand of God. It is divine calligraphy without numbers or letters... \" (94)\n\nFrom there, various theories in Islamic Sufism have come to fruition, all focusing on the human Self in its entirety, taking into account the contributions and extensions associated with it and which are rooted in the collective human spirit. And as a result, one must emphasize the relevance of research in philosophical, theological and Sufi thought as well as the need for its rehabilitation in the light of modern scientific methods available to researchers. This is, an attempt to renew the discussion on the meaning of the world, of man and of God.\n\nSufism, which is practised by Sunnis and Shiites alike, is the Islam of spiritual depth, openness of heart and reconciliation with the sacred. This mystical Muslim path already existed at the time of the Prophet Muhammad (6 century AD), although it did not bear that name. (95)\n\nIt is precisely to reconquer the faithful's heart that Sufi mysticism (96) sets out with originality. Sufism is not a sinecure, but a long journey of initiation. While some believe that the divine is hidden somewhere behind the cumulus clouds, the Sufis are far from this. Spirituality does not fall from the sky; it develops slowly like any other human capacity. (97)\n\nThe Sufi path is a slow and arduous one. It is a path of constancy, patience, spiritual states to attain and passages to complete. The zâhir/bâtin (apparent/hidden) dichotomy, i.e. the idea of an esoteric meaning hidden behind the apparent (linguistic, literal) meaning, is specific to Sufi commentaries. Indeed, for Muslim mystics, the ultimate aim of the Qur'ânic narratives is pedagogical and indicates a personal and spiritual path in the way of God.\n\nSufi commentators often differ on particular points, but for all of them, what is fundamental is the inner struggle with a view to the elevation of the being. It is a journey that involves a passage from multiplicity to unity, through a progression through (permanent) spiritual stations and an elevation through (temporary) spiritual states. The ultimate goal of the journey is holiness and complete union with God. For many Sufis, including the 11-century commentator al-Qushayrî, (98) the story of the sleepers (Qur'ân, 18:9-26), who, persecuted for their faith, take refuge in a cave and miraculously awaken after a sleep of hundreds of years, becomes the image of the stations of detachment and isolation from the world, necessary in the journey towards God. (99)\n\nWhen one begins the Sufi process, his heart is veiled, but as soon as it is purified, it opens, like the lotus in Buddhism, quite simply. The eye that opens will enable one to see, but things of a different order. Because the heart can hear, see, feel, it has extraordinary intelligence. For example, the \"sixth sense\" that some mothers develop towards their child is just the tip of the iceberg of man's spiritual capacities. In a completely fragmented society, prey to a serious spiritual desolation, Sufism has a response to offer to the loss of meaning of modern humanity.\n\nFrom the thirteenth century onwards, Sufism was no longer a marginal phenomenon; in fact, it became the dominant trend in Sunni Islamic culture, single-handedly energising spiritual, intellectual and artistic life. Attracting more and more followers, it reoriented piety and religious life.\n\nSufism is a path of spiritual teaching and \"journeying\" that lies at the heart of the Islamic tradition. (100) It is also an expression of its culture and, one might say, the very spirit of its civilisation. In this sense, Sufism, which is first and foremost a spiritual experience, a 'dhawq' or a personal flavour, has also been, throughout history, the continuous source of intellectual, poetic, literary and artistic (particularly musical) creativity and, in an even more global way, although insufficiently explored, the source of a particularly rich and creative societal productivity. (101)\n\nThe teachings, songs, art or literature of Sufism traditionally expressed in the languages and cultural modalities of the sub-Indian continent, black Africa, the Maghreb, Asia, Central Europe or the Middle East - but largely hidden today - refer to the need to go beyond the limits of egocentrism to access the ultimate and universal meaning of love, knowledge or compassion and essential values that are found at the heart of all the great traditions of wisdom. This supposes that these diverse cultures are not only approached as heritages or legacies of the past but rather by what they can transmit to the world today of their most fertile messages, the celebration of an ultimate sense of Beauty - that which Dostoevsky said that it alone could save the world - which is expressed in a wisdom, a poetics and an art of living. It is important today, by connecting these cultures and the values they convey, to make possible the implementation of this paradigm at the heart of our country at a time when, with the current crisis, each of our societies is questioning the life lessons to be learned from this ordeal and what its new directions will be.\n\nAlso, on the way in which this spiritual culture can contribute to providing answers to the improbable challenges that the era is facing. In what way, with other projects, other schools of thought or cultures, other civilizations, it can contribute to \"giving a soul to globalization\". A globalization that it would then be up to us to regulate in such a way as to lead to new chains of solidarity and collaboration. (102)\n\nSufism, a path of wisdom, embodies an all-too-familiar face of Islam, one of openness, respect and brotherhood. It is a living teaching, transmitted from master to disciple, whose origins go back to the Prophet Muhammad and his companions. (103)\n\nSufism is a path of personal education and inner knowledge, accessible to anyone on a spiritual quest, whatever their culture or social background. For the Sufi disciple, it is through an intimate experience and an active life in society that a dimension of being is revealed, one that conveys the profound meaning of creation. (104)\n\nIt's often said that Sufism is a flavour, and that you can only understand it by tasting it. The Sufi meditation is a shared moment of Sufi practice, based primarily on the invocation of divine names aloud and spiritual chanting. For the disciple, the spiritual influx conveyed by these invocations gradually purifies the heart, illuminating it and eventually setting it ablaze, leaving only unconditional love and divine oneness at the end of the journey. (105)\n\nSufism is the quintessential spirituality of Islam. From the outset, it has been a movement that creates an intimate link between the immortal soul and the divine. The task of a lifetime is to care for this soul, which must absorb light and truth before continuing on its journey... (106)"

And this is Democracy in Question, a podcast about contemporary American politics and the future of democracy. In each episode, I'm asking my guests a different question about democracy so that we can better understand the broader contours of our democratic system.\n\nWell, the 2024 election is over. Former President Donald Trump prevailed over Vice President Kamala Harris in the race for the White House; the House of Representatives will likely remain in GOP control; and the U.S. Senate will shift to a Republican majority. It's a trifecta for the Republican Party in an election with very high voter turnout.\n\nIn this podcast, I've been trying to get at the deeper questions of how democracy works or is supposed to work. I've asked my colleagues to answer questions like How do we build trust in elections? Does my vote really matter? And what does it mean to be an American? You can find all the past episodes on our website at Brookings dot edu slash DemocracyInQuestion, one word.\n\nOn today's episode, the final one of the season, the question is, where does democracy go from here? To help explore and answer this question in the context of the elections for the White House and Congress, I've invited three of my governance studies colleagues to the show. First, Senior Fellow Bill Galston, the Ezra K. Zilkha Chair and senior fellow in Governance Studies. He'll address the question in the context of the race between Trump and Harris.\n\nThen, Sarah Binder, a senior fellow in Governance Studies and professor of political science at George Washington University looks at the question from the perspective of someone who has long studied the Senate.\n\nAnd third, Senior Fellow Molly Reynolds, our resident House expert, tackles the question in the context of the outcome for the United States House of Representatives.\n\nRemember, these are conversations not about why the results happened, but what they say about democracy now and going forward.\n\nTENPAS: Do you think you could start with maybe some of your big picture ideas or comments or reactions and how this election fits into the broader scheme of presidential elections that you've witnessed and written about and studied. And then maybe talk about how that ties into the future of our democracy.\n\nGALSTON: Well, as you said, it was a high turnout election. Probably when the dust settles, not as high as 2020, but still pretty high by historical standards. From a technical standpoint, it also appears to have been a remarkably well-managed campaign. There are different laws in the different states about vote counting procedures, which means that some states are programed to finish quickly and others much more slowly. They're still counting in California, and they probably won't have final results in California until the first week of December. I think they ought to reconsider those procedures. But that's that's just me.\n\nSo, was this a free and fair election? Yeah, sure was. Was there a lot of big money involved? Sure was. Did the winner spend more than the loser? No, not even close. Based on the preliminary figures, Vice President Harris raised hundreds of millions of dollars more than did the Trump campaign. But in the end, it's not clear how much difference that made.\n\nI think that this election confirmed the shift of the Republican Party towards becoming a multiethnic, working-class party, which, if that trend continues, could be extremely significant. And it also dashed a few Democratic Party illusions, you know, that young people would turn out in droves to vote for them, that women angered by the overturning of Roe v Wade and the threat to their reproductive freedom would turn out in droves. That didn't happen either. And it certainly should raise some questions about the familiar phrase \"people of color,\" because there was a significant shift among African American men towards Republicans, even more so among Hispanic men towards Republicans. And although it's a bit too early to tell for sure, the people whom the Census Bureau wraps up as Asian and Pacific Islanders also shifted in the direction in the direction of Trump.\n\nTENPAS: And do you have any explanation for that? I'm sure you're using exit polls and other things, but what do you think accounts for that shift if you had to guess?\n\n[5:29]\n\nGALSTON: Two things. First of all, among Hispanics, and there was already evidence of this in 2020, the education divide is beginning to make a big difference. Already in 2020, there was a 14-point gap between Hispanics with college degrees and without college degrees, the former voting more for Joe Biden and the latter for the Republican candidate. I suspect strongly that that has widened.\n\nAnd it also appears to be the case that gender appeals had an effect. The Harris campaign, by centering her case on reproductive rights, may have sent a message to men, particularly young men, that they were not at the forefront of her concerns. By contrast, the Trump campaign did everything in its power to reach out to men, especially young men. And by all accounts, that media strategy, you know, making use of podcasters who are well known to young men, but not to the general population probably made a difference.\n\nTENPAS: And you talked about sort of the shift away within various groups of color, quote unquote. But was it mostly men or was it across the board, men and women, when you talked about that shift?\n\nGALSTON: It was more men than women. One exit poll found that almost a quarter of African American men voted for Donald Trump. The figure for African American women was way down in single digits, and that split was even sharper among Hispanics.\n\nTENPAS: And what about the Democrats losing the working class vote? Because didn't President Biden do pretty well with that in 2020?\n\n[7:12]\n\nGALSTON: He didn't get close to a majority. He did a little bit better than Hillary Clinton. This is not news. The shift, especially of white working-class voters away from the Democrats, began in 1968. You know, it was the topic of intense analysis after 1980 when Ronald Reagan did very, very well among them. You know, he said, I haven't left the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party left me, and it has left you, too. And a lot of white working-class voters responded to that. So, that's an old story.\n\nThe new story is that nonwhite working-class voters appear to be joining that trend. And if that continues, that will lead to a rolling realignment in American politics.\n\nTENPAS: Interesting. We haven't seen a major realignment in a long time.\n\nGALSTON: No. And, you know, we always think of realigning elections as occurring all at once. Classic examples, 1896, 1932.\n\nTENPAS: Yes.\n\nGALSTON: And we're less accustomed to what I think of as rolling realignments when long term trends over time make a big difference even though in any particular election the shift may appear to be relatively modest.\n\nTENPAS: Right. And what about the future of the Democratic Party? I remember in the aftermath of the Democrats loss in 1984 and 1988 there was the creation of the Democratic Leadership Council. I think you were part of that organization.\n\n[8:37]\n\nGALSTON: Yes. And my view is that 2024, although not a landslide, represents for Democrats a combination of 1980 and 1988. In 1980, Democrats saw the formation of a new Republican coalition that challenged many of their assumptions about the way the electorate was constituted and how it would vote.\n\nAnd in 1988, a third consecutive national defeat convinced Democrats that something had to change and not at the margins. The next four years were devoted to thinking that through and coming up with a new formula for the Democratic Party that turned out to be quite effective and led Democrats to win four of the next six national elections, or conceivably even five of six, depending on what your doubts about 2000 may be.\n\nAnd my view is that after 2024, enough illusions have been shattered so the party will have to go through another four years of reflection and reform. That is just as soon as the circular firing squad disbands.\n\nTENPAS: Yes. Do you think it's worthwhile to recreate something like the DLC that does this kind of concentrated effort to think about how the party can move forward and become successful again?\n\n[10:07]\n\nGALSTON: I suspect that there will be various centers of rethinking and reform. I don't think there's going to be just one. But it will be a vigorous period for the party. Not a happy one, but a vigorous one. And once new ideas and new strategies are on the table it will all be thrashed out, you know, in a primary election, which will represent a real generational transition. You will have a bunch of governors in particular from states ranging from Kentucky to California, Pennsylvania, Michigan. I could go on.\n\nTENPAS: Yeah.\n\nGALSTON: Who have governed successfully, many of whom have won reelections in purple states or even in the case of Kentucky, deep red states will have their own ideas on how the Democratic Party needs to change.\n\nTENPAS: Yeah. And so, it's really not a moment where we just look at the election and said, you know, maybe it was the case that Biden just should have stuck to his promise to just do one term and then there could have been a whole primary process and nomination competition. And so, we can't just sort of look at specific events within this past cycle to say that that was probably the reason you really think given the underlying trends and the rolling realignment that you've suggested that really this is like a moment where there needs to be a radical rethinking of the future of the Democratic Party and how to appeal to more voters.\n\n[11:33]\n\nGALSTON: Well, let me give you a qualified answer to that question. In my view, Biden made four key decisions, all of them, I think, in the first year of this administration and certainly all of them by year two, that shaped the outcome of the 2024 election decisively. First of all, he decided to enact a nearly $2 trillion stimulus package at a time when the economy was already recovering from a recession that had been induced not by economic factors, but by, you know, a pandemic and a government shutdown.\n\nTENPAS: And are you referring to the Inflation Reduction Act?\n\nGALSTON: No, I'm referring to the, you know, I think it's called the American Rescue Plan enacted, I believe, in February.\n\nTENPAS: Oh, right after.\n\nGALSTON: Biden's first year, almost $2 trillion stimulus. I'm not an economist, but along with many economists I believe that that stimulus went too far and contributed to the inflation, which was, you know, objection number one that the voters had to the Biden administration's performance.\n\nSecondly, the administration decided to undo all of Donald Trump's immigration policies and replace them with what turned out to be an ineffective muddle.\n\nThird, Joe Biden had always wanted to leave Afghanistan. You know, he counseled against staying in during the Obama administration and, you know, and was determined to do so. But the way he did it had a catastrophic effect on the American public's confidence in his competence and in his administration. You can just track this very easily with his job approval ratings, which were well above 50% before the withdrawal from Afghanistan. And by the fall, just a month or two afterwards, had fallen into the low 40s where they remained.\n\nDecision number four was to break what many Democrats had heard as an implicit promise to be a one-term president and a transitional president. If he had withdrawn from the race, as in retrospect he certainly should have in in the late fall of 2022 or early spring of 2023, we would have had, you know, a no holds barred Democratic primary at which many new ideas would have been on the table.\n\nSo, it may be that Biden's policy mistakes and his refusal to withdraw made it deferred an overdue debate within the Democratic Party. Deferred it, but it can no longer be postponed.\n\nTENPAS: Right. And I have this sense, too, that after the midterm elections in '22, where they actually did well, they thought that's great, we're doing well. And they forgot about the four mistakes during that first year that basically sunk them eventually. So, they had this false illusion because of the 2022 midterms.\n\n[14:38]\n\nGALSTON: Yes. And in particular, a lot of Democratic analysts who, in my judgment, should have known better, assumed that the abortion issue, which was central in 2022, would have the same impact on a presidential election two years later. That can be it can be a factor in a presidential election. But presidential elections deal with a much broader range of issues. And assuming that, you know, the midterm elections were a leading indicator, you know, of the role that that issue would play in 2024, always struck me as far-fetched.\n\nTENPAS: Interesting. That's very interesting. So, going forward and in light of what you said at the beginning of the conversation was that there was very high turnout, there wasn't violence in any meaningful way, what does it say about American democracy and its future that a race that seemed to be very acrimonious, and there were lots of lots of discussions about, well, we're not sure we're going to accept the results, you know, it depends kind of thing. There was some rhetoric that had a lot of people uneasy about what might happen, but in light of what did happen, are you encouraged about the future of American democracy? Are you somewhat concerned about the Trump administration's tendency to kind of eschew norms and things of that nature? Or how are you feeling?\n\n[15:59]\n\nGALSTON: I remain concerned, largely because I have always believed that if elected, Donald Trump would press executive power to the hilt. And there are already signs that that will happen. There are also questions about whether that executive power will be used in ways that threaten what I consider to be the pillars of a constitutional democracy. For example, a free press. Government is intertwined with the press in various ways. Broadcasters need government granted licenses, for example. And there could be some interference based on political considerations. Reporters need anonymous sources, and there is some early indication that the Trump administration will be much more inclined to prosecute and, you know, prosecute reporters who refuse to reveal the names of anonymous sources. There are also indications that that Mr. Trump would like to expand libel laws, which could have a chilling effect on press coverage.\n\nThere are many other institutions, basic pillars of constitutional democracy. For example, you know, a vigorous and diverse civil society. Will the tax code be used against them, as some Republicans charged that it was used against them during the Obama administration? So, I could work through each one of these pillars of constitutional democracy and indicating why I have fears which are based, I believe, on some evidence, including what the president elect has said. I hope these fears are not realized.\n\nTENPAS: Right. And if I had to push you to put yourself on a scale of 1 to 10 about how worried you are about the future of democracy, where do you think you'd sit on that scale?\n\n[18:02]\n\nGALSTON: Right now, about six. But the only direction I can move is up from that. And I'm and I'm hoping that we get through the next four years with our basic institutions intact. I will consider the next four years a success if that is the outcome.\n\nTENPAS: Yep. And that's a terrific conclusion. Somewhat optimistic, but realistic as well. I really appreciate your time. I always learn something new from you every time I talk to you. So, thank you so much.\n\nTENPAS: And now Sarah Binder, senior fellow in Governance Studies on the question of where does democracy go from here? She'll be the moderator on an event I'm also participating in on the presidential transition, that is, planning and staffing a presidency. You can find that on our website.\n\nTENPAS: Yeah, this is fun. Sarah and I share offices very close to each other, so we're frequently talking about all of these issues, so, you'll have to tell me things you may have already told me during this. But let's talk about what you thought about in the aftermath, aside from the specific breakdown in the Senate, generally speaking, what does that tell you about the future of Senate politics going forward into this new administration?\n\n[19:22]\n\nBINDER: Sure. It's a great a great place to start. When I when I look at what happened in the Senate election outcomes, I see three different screens. Right? One is clearly a red screen. And what do I mean here? Were used to rising partisanship by voters when they go in the voting booth. What does that mean for Senate elections? It means that most states choose the senator from the president's party if they are a member of the president's party. So, I'm a Republican and I live in Missouri, I vote for the Republican Senate candidate and President Trump or whatever you have there. And in fact, that percentage, right? the alignment between the Senate vote and the presidential vote is rising, rising, rising in recent decades, such that 2020 there was just one Senate race where the Republican got elected -- Susan Collins -- but Biden got elected in Maine.\n\nSo, what we'll see here in many of these races, the ones that never made the news, Republicans running in Republican states. And we want to think a little bit about, like, and we can come back to this, like, is that level of just sheer partisanship, is it good? Is it bad? What does it tell us about the capacity of the Senate when it confronts a lot of hard problems? And the Senate rules require often bipartisanship. Like, what does that mean for the Senate's ability to solve problems?\n\nTENPAS: Right. And you're suggesting that because the state is already red and votes for the president of that party, if it's so solidly in the corner of that particular party, they may not have the capacity to sort of work across the aisle.\n\n[21:05]\n\nBINDER: That becomes an issue. If you look at it, the consequences, if you look across the 50 state delegations in the Senate, in the new Congress there will be, unless Senator Casey wins a recount, but let's assume he doesn't, in the new Senate, there will be just three states with divided delegations, split party delegations. That is ... well we call it off hand it's a historic low. But what do we mean? It's never been this low since direct election was ratified in 1913.\n\nTENPAS: Wow!\n\nBINDER: So, it's just a world of difference in terms of the depth and breadth of partisanship. And the same thing on the Democratic side. Right? Extremely rare for a state that elected Biden, or in this case voted for Harris to be represented by a Republican. So, three screens here. We've got two of them. One, I look at the elections and I think there's a red screen there and there's a blue screen. And these are just consistent with what we see historically about the rising spread of partisanship amongst voters. Right? These are voters making these choices.\n\nTENPAS: Yes. Yeah.\n\nBINDER: The most interesting part of this election to me, there's a purple screen in the middle there. And remarkably, these these were the battleground states.\n\nWe all know now there's seven battleground states. Five of them had Senate elections. And the remarkable point is that in four of them, the Democrats won even though Trump won their states. And then the outlier again are Bob Casey from Pennsylvania. Right?\n\nSo, like, what does that mean for us? Well, on the one hand, you think, hey, that that's pretty good for, like, electoral competition that voters are willing to say vote for Republican for Trump and then select the Democrat for the Senate. And at first blush, you think, yeah, that's actually sort of healthy and a little unusual.\n\nTENPAS: Yeah.\n\nBINDER: But then the folks who dig into the votes will tell you this, which it's not clear that that's what voters are doing in those races. Right? One way that happens is voter goes in the voting booth -- I guess they don't have curtains anymore. You just like go up to the thing ...\n\nTENPAS: ... right ...\n\nBINDER: ... and you vote for Trump. Let's say I'm a Republican, I vote for Trump. And then isn't the case then that I vote for, let's say I'm in Nevada, and I vote for Jacky Rosen, the Democrat? That would be split ticket voters. It looks like from the vote outcomes that many Republicans went into the voting booth and voted for Trump and then just either walked out or skipped the Senate race and went further down the ballot. And we call it roll off. Sometimes we call it the undervote. And so, in that case, that's not, like, bipartisan behavior.\n\nTENPAS: Right.\n\nBINDER: That's just like partisan behavior. But you were drawn into the voting booth by Donald Trump. And the good thing for those Senate Democrats is they were really they were incumbents either in the House or they were in the Senate running for the Senate races. They're well-funded, but not great quality, by which we mean, have those Republicans held elective office before? Wisconsin and Arizona, Nevada. But Montana, the Democrat lost.\n\nSo, something is going on here. And it's still despite the blue cast of those states where Democrats actually, those Democratic candidates outperformed Kamala Harris by about one percentage point, but they really probably benefited from these, in part, from these Republican voters, probably many of them not voting at all the Senate races.\n\nTENPAS: Okay. So, I have lots of questions. So, the first just to tie it back to democracy, you would contend that one of the fundamental features of our American democracy, is to have a competitive two-party system. So, if you have a lot of states where it just seems to be almost unanimously in favor of a single party, that suggests that once they get to the Senate, they're less capable of negotiating across the aisle and they're just sort of hardened?\n\nBINDER: That's one possibility, right? You're so used to being on your red team or your blue team. And when you look back home at your voters, you hear a pretty consistent message, a red message or a blue message. And voters, bless their souls, are not always very well informed and they don't really appreciate the need to make compromises. Or to give the other side something they want in response to what you want. So, the one possibility here is the sheer partisanship, it adds to the difficulty of solving problems.\n\nNow, having said that, two party competitive system writ large, we do have a electorally competitive system, just not typically within states, but across the country. Because, look, in a year in which Trump ekes over the popular vote, and we've all seen those maps in the newspapers with like the red arrows in every nook and corner and demographic groups and race and ethnicity. And yet it's a 53 Republican seats, 47 Democrats. And in the House, they don't even really know what the final outcome is.\n\nSo, that is electorally an electorally competitive system. But not strictly within within states.\n\nTENPAS: Yeah, that's interesting. Can you talk a little bit about split ticket voting? I mean, I know that it's it's existed. It's been around. Can you talk about maybe historically what it's looked like in the aftermath of elections and what has happened this year?\n\n[26:30]\n\nBINDER: Sure. So, if we if we drew a graph, we'd see a let's say at mid-twentieth century, we would see a lot of states with split ticket outcomes. And one way to just think about it is we could just count up the number of states and how many were represented by two Democrats, two Republicans, or a Democrat and a Republican. And the number of those split delegations would be maybe 30 plus. I'd have to go check, but really a sizable number.\n\nLike, what is that? It's a couple of things. First, the parties at mid-century and even maybe 1960s, '70s, '80s, begins to wear down in the '90s, the parties then were pretty ideologically diverse. That is, in the Democratic Party, you could have everybody from the far left, liberal progressive Democrats, and then you'd have Southern conservatives like 1940s and '50s -- they were Democrats. But from today's perspective and even back then, we would label them often segregationists. Right? All in the Democratic Party. And so, conservative voters would have a choice in the South. And and there really there were no Republicans to vote for in the South at the congressional level. So, you'd vote for that Democratic senator, but you might vote for Goldwater, the arch Republican for the presidency. And that's how you get, like, behaviors split.\n\nTENPAS: Yeah.\n\nBINDER: So, of course, in the South for the state delegations, they were typically all Democratic. And I should say same thing on the on the Republican Party. There were liberal Republicans and there were conservative Republicans.\n\nBut that's not the shape of the parties today. Right? Partisans, we think we have like an identity with a particular party, and it lines up, did you did you go to college? Do you live in a city? Do you live in certain areas of the country? Do you have a certain economic status or a certain religion? We seem to be coalescing into two different, some people call them tribes, I don't know, but two different kind of groups or identities of voters. And when you feel that way about your party and a little negative toward the other party, you just kind of vote straight party ticket. So, much harder to end up in a world where we see split party delegations. And less likely to see as individual voters splitting their tickets across the different offices.\n\nTENPAS: And tell us I'm giving what you know now about the status of the majority in the Senate. What does that narrow margin politics mean for lawmaking?\n\n[28:57]\n\nBINDER: So, it means a couple of things. First, always keep in mind, because it is a Republican president and a Republican Senate, it makes nominations easier, less doubtful, less doubt that they'll be confirmed because the president's party controls the Senate.\n\nBINDER: Yes, exactly. The question of what does it mean for lawmaking? I would offer I guess let's start with two, maybe, maybe three. So, so, unified party control, it greases the skids in many ways, in part because, right? we have House, Senate, president, each with their own sort of different electoral base and a different electoral timeline. When do I face the voters again?\n\nBut you share a party label, right? You all run with the \"R\" next your name. And that means something, we think, to voters. And we think there's some also common policy agreement across Republicans. So, this policy glue and the electoral glue and unified party control and in theory you can control the, mostly control the agenda in your chamber. It's going to make it easier for your party to pursue their policy goals.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind, though, Senate rules for most policy areas, anything a leader wants to put on the floor, first -- we don't need to go too far in the weeds -- but, you need a motion to proceed to the bill. And that can be debated. And in Senate lingo, if something can be debated, it means it can be filibustered. And you don't even need to go to the floor to filibuster. All you have to do, the leader will go to the floor and say, can I ask unanimous consent to have a vote on proceeding to the bill? Just takes a single senator, say, \"nope, I'm sorry.\" And we saw Coach Tuberville on appointments. We've seen senators in both parties object. And if you get an objection, that means the Senate leader has to go through and the what we call the cloture process.\n\nMost important part there, 60 votes to cut off debate. Why does it matter if you have 52, 53, and maybe you might lose one of the moderates, maybe a Murkowski from Alaska or Collins from Maine. Maybe, maybe someone else might join them on a vote. But by and large, it's going to be really hard to get to 60 even when the parties stick together, even when the Republicans stick together. And so that can be a stumbling block to slim majorities.\n\nThere are workarounds. There are ... well, the big workaround, it's got a fancy title, it's called budget reconciliation. There's limits to what you can pack in the budget reconciliation bills. But the beauty of reconciliation if you're the majority party is no filibuster allowed so long as you comply with all the persnickety rules.\n\nTENPAS: Yeah. Yeah. I see. Okay. So, the majority going forward is not a free ride. It can grease the skids. But there are caveats and there are, you know, obviously, that that whole chamber was created to sort of slow things down. And it's still doing its job to some extent?\n\n[31:59]\n\nBINDER: Yeah, There's historians disagree about what the framers real intent was. Some people say you couldn't actually really filibuster early in the Senate, but it certainly was supposed to be smaller, more conducive to discussion. Those senators are older. Right? Have to be 30 to be sworn in, not 25. And, you know, people didn't live so long back then. So, in theory, they were wiser. Right. They're definitely older today.\n\nTENPAS: Yeah. Yeah. Definitely older.\n\nAnd one other question; you have studied political polarization and written books about it, and do you think that sort of the groundwork that was laid in the '90s that many argue sort of planted the seeds of polarization had has led us to this historic outcome that you cited at the beginning of our discussion. Is this sort of like the logical extenuation of all of those trends?\n\n[32:51]\n\nBINDER: I think in many ways, yes, because one way to think about polarization, right? is is is the opposite. Right? Which is that we used to live in a world with a sort of a large middle, a large political center, right? And if there's a lot of lawmakers in center left, center right, we wouldn't call that polarized. That's the opposite of polarization. So, we've gone from a period in the '60s and '70 where maybe a third of senators were really in the middle if we looked at their voting behavior, that middle is really gone. There really, is barely anybody there in the current finishing Congress. Sinema and Manchin sitting in the middle there on the Democratic, independent side. On the Republican side, really just Collins and Murkowski. Yeah. And I guess as long as the Congress lasts, maybe a Mitt Romney.\n\nSo, as the parties have polarized and the center has disappeared, that's going on at the same time as we see a lot of that at the voter level. And political scientists disagree about are voters as polarized and partisan as the elites and do the elites cause the voter polarization or the voter polarization?\n\nTENPAS: Right.\n\nBINDER: But whatever it is, that's the type of red screen, blue screen electoral outcomes that we saw in all but, right? those five\n\nTENPAS: So, that's really something. So, I typically end my conversations with these incredible scholars with the question about what you're thinking about the future of American democracy. And so, I ask the question on a scale of 1 to 10, how worried are you about the future of American democracy?\n\n[34:33]\n\nBINDER: Well, if we're only thinking about Congress, I'm not a \"the sky's falling.\" I may yet be the sky is falling. If what we're worried about, what I worry about is what I think of this, like, this disappearing Congress. Granted, there are exceptions. We saw it a little bit with early Trump. Certainly, the first two years of the Biden administration, where we had bipartisan agreement -- infrastructure, for instance, chips manufacturing, spending. Right? Congress can get stuff done.\n\nBut so often there's so much there's so many problems that just linger year after year. And, of course, right, immigration today seems to top the list. But the sustainability of entitlements, Social Security and Medicare, access to health care. Right? All these issues just linger in Congress is just not showing up. And what does that mean? It means presidents try to govern by executive order. And for better or for worse, that's not durable. Right? Right.\n\nTENPAS: No more kick the can. They need to stop that, right?\n\nBINDER: You know, easy for us to say. Hard for them. But Congress, you know, it would be good for a system where we thought the framers wanted these, like, we call them checks and balances. This is like some sort of accountability. Right? The one thing framers didn't want was too much power. They don't want another king. Right. Right. And that is what worries me, if lawmakers are so beholden to their parties but just unable to stick up for their institution.\n\nTENPAS: So, where does that put you on the 1 to 10 scale? Push it a little bit. I'm going to make you pick a number.\n\nTENPAS: Okay. Okay. Ooh, you hit the average of what most other participants said. Well, Sarah, thank you so much for taking the time to talk to me today. It was really Interesting.\n\nTENPAS: And now I'm joined by Governance Studies Senior Fellow Molly Reynolds to address the question in the context of the outcome for the United States House of Representatives. Where does democracy go from here? Molly is also a panelist with me at the event I mentioned earlier.\n\nTENPAS: Yeah, really appreciate it. And wondering if you could just speak broadly about the results in the House of Representatives and what you think that means for legislating and governing going forward.\n\n[37:02]\n\nREYNOLDS: Sure. So, today's November 13th. And as it stands right now, it looks like Republicans will control between 220 and 222 seats in the House of Representatives. That is more or less where they began the 118th Congress. So, on one level, we have just spent a lot of time, money, and energy to return to where we started. And it's worth noting that that number may get temporarily smaller. President-elect Trump has indicated that he plans to nominate a few sitting House members to Cabinet positions, which could temporarily reduce the size of that majority for Republicans, because you cannot appoint someone to fill a vacant House seat. House seats can only be filled by an election, and so, there would need to be some time to fill those vacancies via special, special election.\n\nTENPAS: Right. And generally speaking, is there sort of a ballpark figure about how long it takes, or does it vary by state?\n\n[38:02]\n\nREYNOLDS: So, the average is about four months. Sometimes states can and do go a little bit faster than that. Sometimes states can and do go quite a bit longer than that. There is a house vacancy in Florida in recent years that took about ten months to fill. We can and should have a longer conversation about the consequences for democracy of this. It is it is not great that it takes this long to fill House vacancies. It deprives people of really important representation in Congress. And in an era of really narrow majorities, high partisanship, and distressingly high levels of political violence, it potentially incentivizes some pretty dangerous behavior. If someone thinks that the way to flip the House majority is to be a violent act against a member of Congress.\n\nAnd so, there are current sort of, I think, good faith conversations about how to address this. It might require a Constitutional amendment. But I do expect that among the many other things that are going to happen as the result of a narrow Republican House majority that perhaps we'll continue to have these conversations about how could we shore up this particular sort of weak point in our democracy about the possibility of vacancies and how long they last.\n\nTENPAS: Yeah. And you mentioned narrow margin politics. And I'm wondering if you could just give the listeners a quick overview of kind of the history of how we got here, because clearly in the '80s and '90s it wasn't this tight. What's happened and what are the trends that you're seeing?\n\n[39:27]\n\nREYNOLDS: Yeah. So, here, I think it's helpful to actually go all the way back to sort of the end of World War II. And so, between the early 1950s and the mid 1990s, Democrats enjoyed uninterrupted control of the House of Representatives. And until 1980, they enjoyed uninterrupted control of the Senate. So, they had very large, at times, very large majorities and really durable majorities. This was built on the back of a coalition for Democrats that included both northeastern, Midwestern liberals and racist white Southern Democrats. And so, when the party's tent had both of those blocs in it, that made it easier for it to have a really durable majority.\n\nAnd importantly, both parties over that time frame really expected that Democrats would hold the majority really up until 1980, when Republicans took control of the Senate with the election of Ronald Reagan. So, those sort of 30 years before 1980, both parties looked to the next election and thought, Democrats are going to win. And so, if I'm a Republican and I want to get anything done, I have to work with Democrats. And so, that really shaped incentives for bipartisanship.\n\nIn 1980 when Republicans took control of the Senate, that kind of mentality shifted and both parties started to look at the next election as something that either party could win. And it really changed the way that they tended to behave and tended to sort of contest elections in Congress with much more of an eye towards what can I do to keep my opponents from winning or holding the majority? Depending on your perspective in in the next election.\n\nAnd so, that's sort of a long trend. And then we combine that with this, the sort of reduction in the number of competitive, truly competitive House seats such that now control of the House is really being fought out in a handful of districts every year. There are a number of different organizations that rate the competitiveness of House races. If you look at the Cook Political Report, which is one of them, this election they had 22 seats that were sort of true toss ups, that were the most competitive category, which in a body of 435 is not that many.\n\nTENPAS: No. And what does that tell you generally about democracy going forward? It strikes me that one of the fundamental pillars of democracy is to have a competitive two-party system. But if 22 out of 435 House races are actually tossups where there's some competition.\n\n[41:58]\n\nREYNOLDS: Yeah. I mean, so I think our it here sort of depends on what level we're talking about. So, at a macro political level, in terms of could either party win control of the chamber, we're actually at a sort of very high level of macro political competition. Each election cycle, both parties look at the election and think they have a reasonable chance of winning. There are broader factors that will make that more or less likely. So, you know, in a midterm year, particularly a president's first midterm, we know that historically the president's party tends to lose seats. But again, we're at a pretty high level of sort of macro political competition for control of the House.\n\nBut on a more individual district by district level, you're right that we have a declining number of truly competitive congressional districts. And there are a whole host of reasons for this. A lot of it, frankly, just has to do with the way in which Americans have distributed themselves across space and people's residential choices and the fact that people tend to live near other people who share their political opinions.\n\nTENPAS: Right. And that trend has exacerbated over time.\n\nREYNOLDS: It has. It has. And then you add on gerrymandering. So, I don't think gerrymandering is the number one cause here, in part because you can only draw districts so complicated of a way given the underlying distribution of people across space.\n\nBut the declining number of truly competitive House districts does raise some important questions, I think, about democracy. It also suggests that in a lot of places, voters, the most meaningful opportunity voters have to weigh in on who their House member in Congress is going to be is when there's an open seat and there's a primary to select or when you have a primary challenger to select a new nominee. And there I think we can ask questions about, well, who turns out to vote in primaries? Do they look like the same kinds of voters who tend to turn out in general elections? That sort of thing.\n\nTENPAS: And the answer is usually no, right?\n\nREYNOLDS: There's some sort of mixed evidence on this. It's certainly the case that people who are just sort of more informed and more engaged are more likely to turn out on the on the national level. And in a lot of ways that that trend has actually come to benefit Democrats. Historically, it benefited Republicans that Republicans would enjoy a higher turnout in midterm elections and that sort of thing because their voters tended to be ... have all sorts of characteristics that would make them more likely to participate in politics: higher income, higher education. And as those kinds of voters have shifted to the Democratic Party, we now see that in a lot of midterm elections, for example, Democrats have a turnout advantage.\n\nTENPAS: And can you talk a little bit about how unified party control might impact House productivity or House operations?\n\n[44:44]\n\nREYNOLDS: Sure. So, anyone who's watched the House Republican Conference over the past two years has seen evidence of pretty significant divisions within the conference and a lot of struggles for the party to fulfill some of its basic governing responsibilities. I think unified party control will help Republicans manage some of those differences. But I don't know that it will solve them for them, entirely.\n\nParticularly when you're operating with a very little margin for error in the House you can make choices that will alienate three of your members. And if those folks decide they're really going to dig in on something that can make it make your life really difficult.\n\nAnd I think a good place to think about this is something like their plans for a piece ... a large piece of tax legislation. So, in 2025, the tax cuts passed in 2017 during the first Trump administration start to expire. Then the Senate will need to take some action to address that. I think that they will eventually get to a consensus product. But there are factions within particularly the House Republican Conference who want different things out of that bill. So, there are Republicans from high tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California who really want that bill to do something about the state and local tax deduction. That's a really expensive policy proposal that might be at odds with other things that other Republicans want, want to see in that package.\n\nAnd so, unified party control can help, I think, and will help them manage differences. But as we saw in 2017 for Republicans and as we saw in 2021 for Democrats, it does not always sort of make them magically disappear.\n\nTENPAS: Right. And what do you see going forward with the elections for the House leadership?\n\n[46:30]\n\nREYNOLDS: So, my expectation is that Speaker Johnson will get reelected Speaker, although there are many things that can happen between now, November 13th, and ...\n\nTENPAS: ... so don't bet on this.\n\nREYNOLDS: ... and January 3rd. There are many choices that Johnson can make that might frustrate some elements of his of his conference. And so, I don't at this point, I don't know who sort of another alternative would be. And I think that the sort of prospect of getting going on a Republican legislative agenda and unified party control may be enough to, again, sort of get everyone in line behind Johnson. But the House Republican Conference has surprised me in the past two years. And so, it could surprise me in this way as well.\n\nTENPAS: Yeah, I mean, just the resignation or the stepping down of Kevin McCarthy and the numerous votes and ...\n\nREYNOLDS: So, in January, it took I believe 16 votes to finally elect him Speaker and then -- in January of 2023. And then in late September, early October of 2023, was when a group of House Republicans voting with all of the House Democrats sort of used a procedural motion available to them to remove Kevin McCarthy from the speakership.\n\nTENPAS: Yeah. And and am I right in this impression? It seems that majority parties, once they have a majority and, in this case, there might be overconfidence because of the election results and having the presidency and the Senate on their side as well, that it's almost like a license to not disobey, but to sort of raise your own parochial concerns and to kind of be more of a nitpicker. Whereas when you're on the defense, like the Democrats will be, they tend to limit the infighting more because they are in this defensive posture. And so, is it true we might expect to see sort of more infighting and more people speaking about their more parochial interests because they have this majority and there might be this kind of sense of confidence that shouldn't be there?\n\n[48:29]\n\nREYNOLDS: It's a good question. So, I do think that when a party is in the minority, as Democrats are going to be, particularly when they're in what political scientists will call the \"deep minority,\" which means that, you know, they are in the minority in the House and the Senate and they don't control the White House, that there's no onus on you to rack up any legislative accomplishments. You don't have the the reins of power. So, electorally you are likely to think the most effective thing to do is just not do anything that's going to help make the majority's life easier. And then at the next election run against the majority by saying, look, these guys promised they were going to do X, they didn't do X, and you should elect us instead.\n\nOn the majority party front, I think it'll be interesting to watch. They are going to have the opportunity with unified party control to try and actually get done some of the things that they told voters they would do, some things that they told voters that they would do that might not actually have the effects the voters are looking for. So, here I'm thinking about the kind of expected combination of potential tariffs and potential sort of very draconian immigration policy, which could stand to raise prices even further, which is exactly what voters, we seem to think, did not want. You know, one of the things that they were angry about in this election were high prices.\n\nAnd so, it'll be interesting to watch kind of what happens in two years when Republicans will have to run again on whatever record they built in the in the intervening two years. And I'll just say that in 2017, when Republicans had unified party control, some of the moments when President Trump was least popular were when Congress was trying to do things under the mantle of Republican unified control that were unpopular with the public. So, here I'm thinking particularly about their attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act in the summer of 2017, which they failed to do not because Democrats were stopping them, because they were doing it using some procedures that did not require Democratic votes, but because they could not themselves in their own party agree on exactly what they wanted to do in order to repeal and replace that law.\n\nTENPAS: Yeah. So, this is kind of my own issue here, but I am someone that cares a lot about government shutdowns and the inability to come to budget agreements. In part, it exacts a huge price on the executive branch and the civil servants. And so, that's kind of where I'm coming from. But just more broadly speaking, tell me that maybe because it's a unified government, they're less likely to shut the government down.\n\n[51:03]\n\nREYNOLDS: So, why we have unified party control, whatever party is in power is the one who bears, you know, responsibility in the public's mind for keeping the government open or shutting it down. So, in that sense, I do think the prospect of a government shutdown is a little bit lower. Also, at the end of the day, keeping the government open is the kind of thing on which Democrats, even bearing in mind everything I said before about being in the deep minority, that you could imagine Democrats coming to sort of the rescue of Speaker Johnson, as they did a number of times during this last Congress, because just dispositionally, Democrats are less interested in government shutdowns than Republicans are. And so, we will see. Again, the current House Republican conference has surprised me in the past. So, we'll just have to watch that over the next couple of months.\n\nTENPAS: Okay. And just a final question, because you're such a longstanding and astute observer of American politics, I like to ask my guests what they think about the future of American democracy. And just on a scale of 1 to 10, if you could tell me how worried you are about the future of American democracy.\n\n[52:13]\n\nREYNOLDS: It's a hard question, and I think it depends a lot on, you know, what are we talking about? I mean, I am a person who obviously spends a lot of time thinking about the U.S. Congress, which has managed to kind of muddle through some pretty some pretty tough times before. But I also think given the kind of announced positions of President-elect Trump and the real erosion of the guardrails around executive power, some of that erosion has come at the hands of the U.S. Congress and of the Congress refusing to assert its own institutional prerogatives. There's a lot that I'm worried about in the executive branch context in terms of the erosion of democracy more so than I am in the legislative context.\n\nTENPAS: Yeah. So, tell me, if you could put a number on sort of just you can even focus it and limit it to just your concern about democracy from the perspective of focusing on the executive branch.\n\nREYNOLDS: I would say ... I don't I don't like these questions, but if you if you made me, I would I would put my my concern about the executive branch at, you know, a 7, and my concern with the legislative branch at more like a 3 or 4.\n\n[music]\n\nTENPAS: Yeah. And likely to change. Well, thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it. There was a really interesting discussion today.\n\nREYNOLDS: Thanks for having me.\n\nDemocracy in Question is a production of the Brookings Podcast Network. Thank you for listening.

Many Americans cast their ballots with a sense of existential threat posed by the opposing candidate.\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, \"polarization\" refers to \"causing strong disagreement between opposing factions or groupings.\" The dictionary tracks its Word of the Year by analyzing search data, with \"polarization\" seeing a notable rise in lookups.\n\n\"Search volume on Merriam-Webster.com throughout the year reflected Americans' desire to better understand the complex state of affairs in the country and beyond,\" the dictionary said.\n\nThe term is often associated with divisive issues in politics, race relations, and ideology. It extends beyond these connotations, however, being used to describe disagreements in pop culture, technology, and even lighthearted topics like memes.\n\nInterestingly, \"polarization\" originated in the early 1800s, making it relatively young compared to many scientific terms with Latin roots. Sokolowski described it as a term that brings \"intensity\" to discourse and is frequently used in the U.S. to highlight race relations and political divides.\n\n\"The basic job of the dictionary is to tell the truth about words,\" he explained. \"And we've only recently been able to track what words people are actually searching for.\"\n\n\"Polarization\" was a recurring term in media coverage, especially during the elections. From debates over Taylor Swift's private jet usage to feuds between rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake, and even controversies like the International Olympic Committee stripping American gymnast Jordan Chiles of her bronze medal, the word dominated discussions.\n\nEven seemingly issues like Australian breakdancer Rachael \"Raygun\" Gunn's performance memes or the ever popular \"nepo baby\" discourse sparked polarized reactions.\n\n\"It's a word used by both sides,\" Sokolowski noted. \"And, ironically, it's one thing we all seem to agree on.\""

Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who has touted Golden as the person he calls \"to get some sanity back\" on Capitol Hill.\n\nThis year, in one of the costliest races in the land, Golden \"just barely threaded the needle\" to squirm past Republican Austin Theriault to claim the seat in a fourth straight election cycle, as Karl Trautman, a political science instructor at Central Maine Community College, put it.\n\nFor Golden, the narrow win is a confirmation of a strategy he announced last summer in a speech that most clearly laid out his view of politics.\n\nRelated Jared Golden declared winner in Maine's hard-fought 2nd Congressional District race\n\n\"We can be proud progressive conservatives, defying the laws of physics in D.C. politics and forming a covenant with the true American majority,\" he told a gathering in the nation's capital called WelcomeFest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Our success will depend on two things: First is our commitment to place-based politics, which transcends partisanship and defeats extremism. Second is by rejecting the unnatural left-right political spectrum that stokes division and polarization,\" Golden said.\n\nPutting those principles into practice, though, is tough in the supercharged political environment in which both Golden and Trump operate.\n\nAfter all, the two men were both successful in Maine's 2nd District with wildly different approaches on the campaign trail.\n\nTrump is an outsized personality, bombastic and sometimes crude, always craving attention and demanding loyalty.\n\nGolden is, well, nothing like that.\n\nPut Trump in a crowded room and he will grab the spotlight and start talking. Do the same with Golden and he might just stand in a corner, watching quietly and listening carefully, barely noticeable in a flannel shirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet despite his stylistic and policy differences from Trump, Golden's approach worked. He won over enough Trump voters to keep his job.\n\nThe root of Golden's victory \"is the same as the secret to the success of many elected officials over the years: he understands his constituents and his district,\" University of Maine professor Mark Brewer said.\n\n\"He read the room,\" Trautman said.\n\nBrewer, who teaches political science, said Golden \"strongly advocates for his constituents' interests and positions on the issues that really matter to them, and he has earned their trust.\"\n\n\"While this may seem like a simple formula, it is difficult to successfully pull off,\" especially in such a closely divided district, Brewer said.\n\nBut, he said, Golden has shown \"a willingness to act in a bipartisan manner and has developed a record and a persona that set himself (apart) from the stereotypical national Democrat.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Nothing delivers a message quite like winning does,\" Mario Moretto, Golden's communications director, said.\n\nROOTED IN COMMUNITY\n\nGolden's ancestors lived in Lewiston, a place he described as \"an industrial town that for generations was dominated by textile mills and shoe factories but lost those jobs to globalization.\"\n\nAs a result, his father's family moved to Winthrop. By the time Golden was born 42 years ago, his parents ran a small golf course in Leeds, which Golden remembered as \"a dairy farm town back then but today the cows are mostly gone.\"\n\nAs a child, he said, \"I couldn't tell you which of the farmers in town were Republicans or Democrats, or whether my parents' customers voted Red or Blue.\"\n\n\"In fact, most of them weren't either,\" Golden told WelcomeFest. He pointed out that when he was 10 \"a guy with big ears named Ross Perot won the town I grew up in\" and almost won the 2nd District, too.\n\nAdvertisement Related Jared Golden on voters who helped reelect him: 'I think they feel like I'm being real'\n\nPerot, a presidential contender for the Reform Party who warned about exploding federal spending and deficits, \"made a lot of good points,\" Golden added.\n\nIn any case, Golden said, \"what bound everyone together when I was growing up in Leeds wasn't a political identity. It was the hours and years working together, and spending time together. The time spent in diner booths, church pews, on stumps around a fire and school gymnasium bleachers. What connected us was the place, the people, and the way of life. It was our culture -- our local culture.\"\n\nFor Golden, any successful politics must be rooted in that same sense of community.\n\n\"I have always run as a Democrat,\" the lawmaker said. \"I believe in the power and necessity of unions, inequality and civil rights.\"\n\n\"But I won a lot of votes from Republicans and independents, too, and from Democrats who no longer feel much in common with the Democratic Party,\" Golden observed.\n\n\"I believe they vote for me because they know I'm one of them. I'm from where they're from. I live like them, talk like them. Always have.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 'PROGRESSIVE CONSERVATIVE'\n\nGolden insists he is not a liberal, not a conservative and, perhaps most telling, not a moderate.\n\nHe said the \"constant narrative telling us the political spectrum\" is a form of shorthand he believes \"is far more harmful than illuminating.\"\n\n\"The political spectrum does not exist in nature,\" Golden said. \"There's nothing real and tangible\" about it \"because it's a construct of the human mind, and it is in constant flux, constant change, and it means different things from place to place, country to country, and era to era.\"\n\nGolden said the incessant effort to divide politics into right and left merely encourages polarization and rhetoric that \"gets hotter and hotter\" to the point where it feels like there's an existential split.\n\nAs a result, he said, it turns people \"with whom you had good faith disagreements into sworn enemies\" and can splinter lifelong friendships, even families.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, Golden said, \"left-right politics ignore the complexities of actual voters.\"\n\n\"Each of us has progressive and conservative impulses alike,\" the lawmaker said. \"These are not in tension -- and building a political system that puts them in opposition to each other is a recipe for disaster.\"\n\nRelated Jared Golden calls for wide-ranging overhaul of U.S. House\n\nHis own answer is to call his politics \"progressive conservatism,\" a way to span the divide or split the difference.\n\nGolden offered an example of his progressive conservatism: \"I have told voters for years that I believe we should raise taxes on the wealthy to help cut the deficit. When I discuss this with voters, most of them agree\" it's a sound, mainstream policy.\n\nBut a partisan political system \"doesn't know what to do with a proposal like this,\" Golden said.\n\n\"Progressives who normally favor raising taxes on the rich would reject it, convinced that any concern with the deficit is a dog whistle for cuts to social insurance programs for the poor,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConservatives, on the other hand, \"would oppose it because their devotion to fiscal responsibility ends at raising taxes on the wealthy even to balance the budget and save the nation from fiscal ruin.\"\n\n'PROGRESSIVE ECONOMICS, CULTURAL CONSERVATISM'\n\nGolden said his position, distilled to a phrase, is \"progressive economics, cultural conservatism.\"\n\nThe progressive economics piece is straightforward, to Golden: \"Tax the rich to cut the deficit. Pro-business and antitrust. Corporate welfare is bad, direct payments to families are good. Financialization of the economy is sometimes bad, protective tariffs are sometimes good.\"\n\nBut \"cultural conservatism\" is a little tougher to grasp.\n\n\"What I am referring to is a political fault line I believe most Democrats don't even know exists,\" Golden said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe pointed out as examples, \"the backlash among my constituents to climate change policies, like electric vehicle mandates and higher energy prices,\" student debt, concerns about crime and worries about immigration across \"an unsecured southern border.\"\n\nGolden said some Democrats say they \"aren't real issues\" and people shouldn't be so concerned about them. But, he said, that's the wrong approach.\n\n\"Populist energy comes from the vast majority of Americans who don't fit neatly on the political spectrum,\" he said, and \"is expressed in alternating waves of rage, disgust and despair toward the centers of power in Washington and Wall Street.\"\n\nGolden said, \"Populism is the public's disdain of an elite consensus that seems stacked in favor of the powerful and wealthy -- regardless of party or ideology -- at the expense of everyone else -- regardless of party or ideology.\"\n\n\"It's rage at trade policies championed by Democrats and Republicans alike that shipped jobs or entire industries overseas, putting our trade sheets in deficit in service of CEO and shareholder profits,\" he said, and \"disgust with politicians who leverage their public service to land seven-figure lobbying jobs within days of losing an election.\"\n\n\"It is despair that even after dutifully voting in every election they are told is the most important one of their lives, they are still facing the same challenges in their day-to-day lives,\" Golden added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Populism will always be a force aimed at the powerful. Our job isn't to harness populism. It's to feel it, and to use our power as elected officials to chip away at the consensus that so many Americans feel is rigged against them,\" Golden said.\n\nRejecting partisanship and recognizing the \"anger and frustration\" that voters feel can overcome polarization, he said.\n\n\"That the promise of progressive conservatism,\" Golden said.\n\nGOLDEN'S SUCCESS HAS OTHER FACTORS TOO\n\nJames Melcher, a professor of political science at the University of Maine at Farmington, said Golden benefits from the longstanding willingness of independent-minded Mainers to split their votes.\n\nHe said the big wins racked up in 2008 by both Democratic presidential contender Barack Obama and Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, who each led their opponent by double digits, are a solid example of a pattern that helped Golden as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMelcher said Golden this year \"went out of his way to be much more critical\" of President Joe Biden during the campaign than he was toward Trump, a man he once voted to impeach.\n\nMelcher also pointed out that Theriault, the GOP candidate Golden defeated, wasn't well-known heading into the race. That allowed negative advertising to define him for many voters.\n\nThat Golden is a veteran who served in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan is also \"a real plus\" in a district with many veterans, Melcher said.\n\nIn addition, he said, it's possible some voters backed Trump because they were hesitant to vote for a woman for the nation's top job, a bias that would not have kept them from casting a ballot for Golden.\n\nTrautman said Golden opted to vote with the Republicans on a good many symbolic measures that stood little chance of becoming law, the kind of political skirmishes meant to provide ammunition on the campaign trail.\n\nGolden figured that liberals wouldn't like his decisions on some of those types of bills, Trautman said, but ultimately would vote for him anyway because they dislike the GOP candidate even more.\n\nIt worked, Trautman said.\n\n\"The proof is in the pudding. He got over the line,\" he said.\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nfiled under: 2nd Congressional District, Rep.

It's most commonly used to mean \"causing strong disagreement between opposing factions or groupings.\" Merriam-Webster, which logs 100 million pageviews a month on its site, chooses its word of the year based on data, tracking a rise in search and usage.\n\nLast year's pick was \"authentic.\" This year's comes as large swaths of the U.S. struggle to reach consensus on what is real.\n\n\"It's always been important to me that the dictionary serve as a kind of neutral and objective arbiter of meaning for everybody,\" Sokolowski said. \"It's a kind of backstop for meaning in an era of fake news, alternative facts, whatever you want to say about the value of a word's meaning in the culture.\"\n\nIt's notable that \"polarization\" originated in the early 1800s -- and not during the Renaissance, as did most words with Latin roots about science, Sokolowski said. He called it a \"pretty young word,\" in the scheme of the English language. \"Polarized is a term that brings intensity to another word,\" he continued, most frequently used in the U.S. to describe race relations, politics and ideology.\n\n\"The basic job of the dictionary is to tell the truth about words,\" the Merriam-Webster editor continued. \"We've had dictionaries of English for 420 years and it's only been in the last 20 years or so that we've actually known which words people look up.\"\n\n\"Polarization\" extends beyond political connotations. It's used to highlight fresh cracks and deep rifts alike in pop culture, tech trends and other industries.\n\nAll the scrutiny over Taylor Swift's private jet usage? Polarizing. Beef between rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake? Polarizing. The International Olympic Committee's decision to strip American gymnast Jordan Chiles of her bronze medal after the Paris Games? You guessed it: polarizing.\n\nEven lighthearted memes -- like those making fun of Australian breakdancer Rachael \"Raygun\" Gunn's performance -- or the proliferation of look-alike contests, or who counts as a nepo baby proved polarizing.\n\nParadoxically though, people tend to see eye to eye on the word itself. Sokolowski cited its frequent use among people across the political spectrum, including commentators on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN.\n\n\"It's used by both sides,\" he said, \"and in a little bit ironic twist to the word, it's something that actually everyone agrees on.\"\n\nTikToker Jools Lebron's 38-second video describing her workday makeup routine as \"very demure, very mindful\" lit up the summer with memes. The video has been viewed more than 50 million times, yielding \"huge spikes\" in lookups, Sokolowski said, and prompting many to learn it means reserved or modest.\n\nFortnight\n\nTaylor Swift's song \"Fortnight,\" featuring rapper Post Malone, undoubtedly spurred many searches for this word, which means two weeks. \"Music can still send people to the dictionary,\" Sokolowski said.\n\nTotality\n\nThe solar eclipse in April inspired awe and much travel. There are tens of millions of people who live along a narrow stretch from Mexico's Pacific coast to eastern Canada, otherwise known as the path of totality, where locals and travelers gazed skyward to see the moon fully blot out the sun. Generally, the word refers to a sum or aggregate amount -- or wholeness.\n\nResonate\n\n\"Texts developed by AI have a disproportionate percentage of use of the word 'resonate,'\" Sokolowski said. This may be because the word, which means to affect or appeal to someone in a personal or emotional way, can add gravitas to writing. But, paradoxically, artificial intelligence \"also betrays itself to be a robot because it's using that word too much.\"\n\nAllision\n\nThe word was looked up 60 times more often than usual when, in March, a ship crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. \"When you have one moving object into a fixed object, that's an allision, not a collision. You're showing that one of the two objects struck was not, in fact, in motion,\" Sokolowski said.\n\nWeird\n\nThis summer on the TV news show \"Morning Joe,\" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called Republican leaders \"weird.\" It may have been what launched his national career, landing him as the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Though it's a word that people typically misspell -- is it \"ei\" or \"ie\"? -- and search for that reason, its rise in use was notable, Sokolowski said.\n\nCognitive\n\nWhether the word was used to raise questions about President Joe Biden's debate performance or Trump's own age, it cropped up often. It refers to conscious intellectual activity -- such as thinking, reasoning, or remembering.\n\nPander\n\nPander was used widely in political commentary, Sokolowski said. \"Conservative news outlets accused Kamala Harris of pandering to different groups, especially young voters, Black voters, gun rights supporters.\" Whereas Walz said Trump's visit to a McDonald's kitchen pandered to hourly wage workers. It means to say, do, or provide what someone -- such as an audience -- wants or demands even though it is not \"good, proper, reasonable, etc.\"\n\nDemocracy\n\nIn 2003, Merriam-Webster decided to make \"democracy\" its first word of the year. Since then, the word -- which, of course, means a form of government in which the people elect representatives to make decisions, policies and laws -- is consistently one of the dictionary's most looked up. \"There's a poignancy to that, that people are checking up on it,\" Sokolowski said. \"Maybe the most hopeful thing that the curiosity of the public shows, is that they're paying attention.\"\n\n___"

Is it any surprise then that the Merriam-Webster word of the year is \"polarization\"?\"Polarization means division, but it's a very specific kind of division,\" said Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement. \"Polarization means that we are tending toward the extremes rather than toward the center.\"The election was so divisive, many American voters went to the polls with a feeling that the opposing candidate was an existential threat to the nation.

        "content": "Hip-hop isn't just a genre -- it's a cultural movement, an art form, and a global phenomenon that has shaped music, fashion, and storytelling for decades. At the heart of this revolutionary culture are the rappers: lyrical masterminds who combine rhythm, poetry, and raw emotion to create music that resonates across generations. From the gritty streets of New York to the vibrant sounds of the West Coast and beyond, these artists have elevated rap from underground battles to a worldwide stage, leaving an indelible mark on history.\n\nIn this article, we're diving into the top 15 best rappers of all time -- icons whose talent, influence, and innovation have defined and redefined hip-hop. These are the wordsmiths who've turned personal struggles into universal anthems and pioneered styles that have inspired countless others. Whether it's their impeccable flow, unmatched storytelling, or cultural impact, these rappers have earned their place in the pantheon of greatness.\n\nFrom lyrical geniuses like Nas and Rakim to chart-dominating powerhouses like Jay-Z and Eminem, this list celebrates the architects of rap. So, get ready to revisit the legacy of these legends and discover why their music continues to move bodies, challenge minds, and inspire the soul. Let's dive in!\n\nTupac Shakur, also known as 2Pac, was far more than just a rapper -- he was a voice for the voiceless, a poet, an activist, and a symbol of resistance for his generation. His lyrics painted a vivid picture of the struggles that Black Americans faced, from the harsh realities of urban life to the weight of systemic racism. Tupac's music wasn't just about telling his own story -- it was about telling the stories of his community, his culture, and the world around him. Albums like All Eyez on Me and Me Against the World have solidified Tupac's place in history, not only as a musical icon but as a cultural force. He had an unmatched ability to weave vulnerability and defiance into his songs. In tracks like \"Dear Mama,\" he expressed his deep love and gratitude for his mother, while simultaneously reflecting on the struggles they both faced growing up. On the other hand, songs like \"Hail Mary\" demonstrated his raw intensity and fearlessness in the face of a world that often seemed stacked against him. His music was a mix of both personal and political, often challenging societal norms, questioning authority, and speaking on topics like police brutality, inequality, and the complexities of life as a Black man in America. Even years after his untimely death, Tupac's influence is still felt in hip-hop and beyond. His messages of resilience, social justice, and introspection continue to inspire new generations of artists and activists. Tupac's music remains timeless, and his legacy is one that will never be forgotten, making him one of the most significant figures in the history of hip-hop.\n\nChristopher Wallace, better known as The Notorious B.I.G. or Biggie Smalls, was the epitome of a storytelling genius. His ability to craft vivid narratives in his raps made him a beloved figure in hip-hop. His debut album, Ready to Die, introduced a new level of complexity to the genre, showcasing his impeccable flow, unique voice, and knack for balancing street tales with personal reflections. Tracks like \"Juicy\" and \"Big Poppa\" became anthems, with their smooth beats and Biggie's effortless ability to spit bars that felt both relatable and aspirational. Biggie's larger-than-life persona was evident, but so was his vulnerability. He rapped about his troubled upbringing, his rise to fame, and the dichotomy of living the \"good life\" while still being entrenched in the gritty realities of the streets. His second album, Life After Death, solidified Biggie's legacy, taking his sound even further. Songs like \"Hypnotize\" and \"Mo Money Mo Problems\" revealed his versatility, with Biggie seamlessly switching from braggadocio to introspection without ever losing his signature style. His storytelling ability was unmatched, blending street sensibility with a level of artistry that elevated his music beyond the typical rap game tropes. Tragically, Biggie's life was cut short, but the impact of his music, his unique flow, and his ability to make his experiences feel universal has cemented his place as one of the greatest rappers of all time. Even years after his passing, The Notorious B.I.G.'s influence continues to shape the sound and culture of hip-hop today, and his music remains a cornerstone of the genre.\n\nJay-Z, also known as Hov, is the definition of longevity and reinvention in hip-hop. From his early days in Brooklyn's Marcy Projects, he rose from the streets to become one of the most influential and successful figures in the history of hip-hop. His journey has been one of constant growth, not just musically but also in terms of business ventures, cultural influence, and social consciousness. Albums like Reasonable Doubt, The Blueprint, and 4:44 have become landmarks in hip-hop, each offering a different glimpse into the life of one of the genre's greatest minds. On Reasonable Doubt, Jay-Z's smooth delivery and sharp lyricism introduced the world to his world of hustling, ambition, and dreams of success. Tracks like \"Can't Knock the Hustle\" and \"Feelin' It\" explored the complexities of street life, while songs like \"Brooklyn's Finest\" highlighted his dynamic chemistry with fellow artist The Notorious B.I.G. As Jay-Z's career evolved, so did his sound. The Blueprint was an album that not only defined his career but also the sound of early 2000s hip-hop, thanks in large part to the production of Kanye West and Just Blaze. Tracks like \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\" and \"Takeover\" showed Jay's sharp wit, while \"Song Cry\" and \"Heart of the City\" demonstrated his vulnerability and introspection. Jay-Z continued to evolve with each project, never sticking to one formula but constantly challenging himself to remain relevant in a changing musical landscape. His business ventures outside of music, such as his ownership of Tidal and his Roc Nation empire, have made him one of the first billion-dollar rappers, cementing his legacy as not only an artist but also an entrepreneur. Jay-Z's influence transcends hip-hop, making him a cultural figure whose reach extends far beyond the music world. His ability to tell his story while also addressing broader societal issues, like the struggles of Black America, has made him a voice for change and an icon of the genre.\n\nNasir Jones, better known as Nas, is widely regarded as one of the greatest lyricists in hip-hop history. His debut album, Illmatic, is often considered the greatest rap album ever made, with its perfect blend of poetic lyricism, intricate wordplay, and vivid storytelling. Tracks like \"N.Y. State of Mind\" and \"The World Is Yours\" captured the essence of urban life in New York City, with Nas painting a picture of the streets that felt real and raw. Nas's ability to craft stories that were both personal and universal set him apart from many of his peers. His intricate rhyme schemes, combined with his delivery and ability to capture the nuances of the human experience, made him a revered figure in hip-hop from the start. Over the years, Nas has continued to evolve and expand his musical palette, tackling themes ranging from social justice to personal introspection. His King's Disease album, which won a Grammy Award, proved that Nas's relevance hasn't waned despite the changing landscape of hip-hop. Tracks like \"Car #85\" and \"All Bad\" show his ability to adapt to modern sounds while still staying true to his lyrical roots. Nas is more than just a rapper -- he is a poet and a philosopher, using his music to delve deep into issues of race, identity, and personal growth. His intellectual depth and social commentary have made him a voice for those who seek not just entertainment but a deeper understanding of the world around them. Nas's legacy is one of cultural importance, poetic brilliance, and social consciousness, solidifying him as a titan in hip-hop and a voice that continues to resonate today.\n\nEminem, also known as Slim Shady, is undeniably one of the most technically skilled and influential rappers in the history of hip-hop. He burst onto the scene with his debut album, The Slim Shady LP, which immediately established him as one of the most controversial and unapologetic voices in the genre. With his rapid-fire delivery, unmatched wordplay, and willingness to tackle personal and societal issues head-on, Eminem became an instant sensation. His unique style set him apart from many of his peers, blending dark humor, shock value, and raw emotion into every verse. Songs like \"My Name Is\" and \"Guilty Conscience\" showcased his ability to blend storytelling with an almost theatrical sense of humor, while tracks like \"Stan\" and \"Lose Yourself\" revealed his deep emotional depth. The Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show further solidified his place in hip-hop history, with Eminem's complex rhyme schemes and ability to confront personal demons making him relatable to millions. Eminem's influence goes beyond just his music. He broke barriers for white rappers in a predominantly Black genre and pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable in mainstream rap. He's also become a global icon, known for his authenticity, his boldness, and his ability to speak on issues like mental health, addiction, and fame with brutal honesty. Despite facing criticism and controversy throughout his career, Eminem's ability to reinvent himself while staying true to his roots has kept him at the top of the rap game for decades. His legacy is built on his remarkable lyrical abilities, his fearless approach to difficult topics, and his lasting impact on the culture of hip-hop.\n\nKendrick Lamar is widely regarded as one of the most important and innovative rappers of his generation. His artistry transcends the boundaries of traditional hip-hop, blending intricate lyricism, social commentary, and genre-defying production to create a body of work that speaks to the times. Kendrick's magnum opus, To Pimp a Butterfly, is a masterpiece that tackles themes of race, identity, and the complexities of the Black experience in America. Songs like \"Alright\" and \"King Kunta\" became anthems of empowerment, resonating deeply with audiences who saw in Kendrick's lyrics a reflection of their own struggles. Kendrick's music is deeply personal, often addressing his own experiences and growth, but it also carries universal themes that touch on societal issues and the human condition. His album DAMN. further cemented his place in hip-hop history, offering a more introspective look at spirituality, morality, and the duality of life. Tracks like \"HUMBLE.\" and \"DNA.\" showcased his incredible technical skill, while songs like \"LOVE.\" and \"FEAR.\" explored his vulnerability and introspection. Kendrick's ability to craft albums that feel like complete, cohesive statements is part of what sets him apart from his contemporaries. He's not just making songs -- he's creating art that challenges listeners to think critically about the world around them. Kendrick is also a cultural force, using his platform to speak on issues like police brutality, mental health, and racial injustice. His Pulitzer Prize win for DAMN. marked a historic moment, solidifying him as not just a rapper but a voice for change. Kendrick Lamar is more than just a musician -- he is an artist who continues to push the boundaries of hip-hop, challenging the genre's conventions and its role in shaping culture.\n\nRakim, half of the legendary duo Eric B. & Rakim, is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential rappers of all time. His innovative approach to rhyming and flow redefined hip-hop and set a new standard for what it meant to be an emcee. Rakim's debut album, Paid in Full, is often regarded as one of the greatest hip-hop albums ever made, with tracks like \"Eric B. Is President\" and \"Microphone Fiend\" showcasing his complex rhyme schemes and smooth delivery. Rakim's ability to weave intricate patterns of wordplay, internal rhymes, and multisyllabic flows made him a revolutionary figure in hip-hop, influencing countless artists who followed in his footsteps. At a time when many rappers were focused on simpler, more direct delivery, Rakim pushed the boundaries of lyrical complexity, showing that rap could be an art form that demanded technical skill and intellectual depth. His partnership with Eric B. helped shape the sound of hip-hop in the late '80s, with their combination of jazz-infused beats and Rakim's meticulous, thought-provoking lyrics creating a distinctive sound that set them apart from other hip-hop acts of the era. Rakim's legacy in hip-hop is undeniable; his influence can be heard in the work of countless artists who have adopted his style and expanded on his innovations. His approach to rhyming set the foundation for much of what we hear in rap today, from the fluidity of the flow to the technical precision of the lyrics. Rakim's pioneering work helped establish hip-hop as a genre that wasn't just about catchy hooks and party anthems, but about lyricism, creativity, and intellectual expression.\n\nKanye West is one of the most innovative and controversial figures in the history of hip-hop. From his early days as a producer to his rise as a solo artist, Kanye has continually pushed the boundaries of what hip-hop can be, blending various genres, themes, and sounds to create music that is both revolutionary and deeply personal. His debut album, The College Dropout, introduced him as a unique voice in hip-hop, with its soulful production, introspective lyrics, and social commentary. Tracks like \"Through the Wire\" and \"Jesus Walks\" showcased Kanye's ability to blend vulnerability and faith with sharp commentary on the struggles of everyday life. Kanye's follow-up albums, such as Late Registration and Graduation, continued to expand his sound, incorporating orchestral elements and synthesizing genres like pop and electronic music into his hip-hop foundation. But it was My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy that truly elevated Kanye to the level of musical genius. The album's grandiose production, dark themes, and personal introspection combined to create one of the most critically acclaimed albums of the decade. Songs like \"Power,\" \"Runaway,\" and \"All of the Lights\" showcased Kanye's innovative approach to music, blending genres and creating anthems that were as emotionally charged as they were sonically experimental. Kanye's influence extends beyond music -- he has become a fashion icon, an outspoken cultural figure, and a symbol of artistic freedom. His boldness, both in his personal life and in his music, has made him a polarizing figure, but there's no denying the impact he has had on hip-hop and popular culture. Kanye's career has been defined by his willingness to take risks, his ability to innovate, and his unapologetic approach to both his music and his persona, making him one of the most important figures in modern hip-hop.\n\nDr. Dre is not just a rapper; he is a visionary producer whose influence on hip-hop is immeasurable. As a founding member of N.W.A., Dr. Dre helped bring gangsta rap into the mainstream, with the group's seminal album Straight Outta Compton becoming a cultural touchstone for its unapologetic portrayal of street life and social injustice. But it was his solo albums, The Chronic and 2001, that truly solidified his legacy as one of the greatest producers and hip-hop moguls in history. Tracks like \"Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang\" and \"Still D.R.E.\" became anthems, with Dre's signature G-funk production style dominating the West Coast rap scene in the '90s. But Dre's impact didn't stop at his own music -- he was also responsible for launching the careers of some of hip-hop's biggest stars, including Snoop Dogg, Eminem, and Kendrick Lamar. Through his production company, Aftermath Entertainment, Dre helped shape the sound of modern hip-hop, mentoring a new generation of artists and helping them refine their craft. Dre's ability to create unforgettable beats and his sharp ear for talent made him one of the most influential figures in the industry. His business savvy, combined with his innovative approach to music, allowed him to build a hip-hop empire that spans decades. Even as he stepped back from performing, Dr. Dre remained an integral figure in the industry, with his influence reaching far beyond just music. His legacy as a producer, businessman, and mentor is as important as his contributions as a rapper, making him a central figure in the history of hip-hop.\n\nSnoop Dogg is one of the most iconic and recognizable figures in hip-hop, known for his smooth flow, laid-back demeanor, and West Coast swagger. Rising to fame as a protege of Dr. Dre, Snoop's debut album, Doggystyle, became an instant classic, with tracks like \"Gin and Juice\" and \"Who Am I (What's My Name)?\" becoming anthems of the '90s. Snoop's effortless delivery and charisma made him a fan favorite, but his influence extended far beyond just his music. Snoop Dogg became the face of West Coast rap, representing a laid-back, party-ready lifestyle while still addressing the harsh realities of street life. His music was often laced with humor, but it also reflected the complexity of his experiences and his perspective on the world around him. Over the years, Snoop Dogg has maintained his relevance in hip-hop, continuously evolving his sound while staying true to his roots. His albums, like Tha Doggfather and No Limit Top Dogg, helped to cement his place in hip-hop history, while his collaborations with artists across genres showcased his versatility. Snoop's influence has expanded beyond music, with his ventures in acting, television, and even cannabis culture, making him a global brand. Through it all, Snoop has remained true to his roots, continuing to make music that resonates with fans old and new. His career is a testament to his ability to adapt, innovate, and stay relevant in an ever-changing industry while maintaining his unique voice and persona.\n\nLil Wayne, often hailed as one of the greatest rappers of his generation, revolutionized hip-hop with his unique style, prolific output, and creative wordplay. Rising to prominence as a member of the Hot Boys, Wayne's early career was marked by his hard-hitting delivery and streetwise narratives. However, it was his solo albums, particularly Tha Carter series, that solidified his place in rap history. Tha Carter III, released in 2008, was a game-changer, featuring hits like \"Lollipop,\" \"A Milli,\" and \"Lollipop,\" and showcasing his versatility from club anthems to introspective tracks. Wayne's ability to fuse street sensibilities with mainstream appeal made him a standout figure in hip-hop, while his often surreal, punchline-heavy rhymes helped elevate his artistry. His influence extends beyond his own music, as Wayne played a pivotal role in shaping the careers of artists like Drake, Nicki Minaj, and Tyga through his label, Young Money. As one of the first to experiment with mixtapes on a grand scale, Wayne brought a new level of creativity and innovation to the mixtape circuit, offering fans a steady stream of new music that defied traditional release schedules. Despite his success, Wayne has never shied away from pushing boundaries, always experimenting with new sounds and approaches to his music. His contributions to hip-hop go beyond just his technical skill; he's a cultural icon who has influenced not only music but fashion, trends, and the broader culture of rap. Lil Wayne's legacy as a trailblazer in the industry is secure, and his continued relevance in the ever-evolving world of hip-hop speaks to his unparalleled staying power.\n\nAndré 3000, one half of the legendary duo OutKast, is widely regarded as one of the most inventive and eclectic figures in hip-hop. With his poetic lyrics, genre-bending production, and boundary-pushing creativity, André has built a career that transcends the traditional expectations of a rapper. His work with OutKast, particularly on albums like Aquemini and Stankonia, broke new ground in hip-hop, combining elements of funk, soul, rock, and electronic music with thought-provoking, deeply personal lyrics. André's verses on tracks like \"Ms. Jackson\" and \"Hey Ya!\" showcased his ability to blend commercial appeal with innovative sounds, making him a pioneer of genre-blending in hip-hop. Beyond his work with OutKast, André's solo ventures further exemplified his artistic range, with his collaborations often taking unexpected turns into new musical territory. Tracks like \"Prototype\" from his album The Love Below demonstrated his versatility, with André combining R&B, funk, and soul influences to create something wholly unique.

        "content": "A conversation with Lauren Chavez-Moreno, author of \"How Schools Make Race: Teaching Latinx Racialization in America.\"\n\nAs a former Spanish teacher, Lauren Chavez-Moreno often witnessed her students grappling with racial identity and cultural expectations in ways she wasn't fully prepared to address. Her students' comments and questions opened her eyes to the complexities of racialization within the school system. She recalls the challenges of navigating these moments, feeling the weight of her responsibility as an educator to address these issues thoughtfully.\n\nChavez-Moreno's new book, \"How Schools Make Race: Teaching Latinx Racialization in America,\" draws from these formative experiences, blending them with years of academic research to unpack how schools subtly shape racial identities, especially for Latinx students.\n\nThe book addresses sensitive issues, like the limitations placed on teachers in discussing race openly, the diversity (or lack thereof) within bilingual teaching staff, and the challenges faced by Latinx students in predominantly white school systems.\n\nChavez-Moreno's decision to avoid naming specific schools or states in her research highlights the universal nature of racialization in education. As she points out, the underlying process of racial identity formation is a nationwide phenomenon, not confined to any particular region. This broad perspective underscores the pervasiveness of racialization in shaping students' identities, an issue Chavez-Moreno believes requires urgent attention from educators, administrators, and policymakers alike.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThis book essentially covers the time when Donald Trump was elected president in 2016 and fast forward to now. The book is out and we live in a reality where Trump will be president again. So I simply want to ask you, what does the re-election of Donald Trump mean for this type of research and future work?\n\nI'm not really sure how I could answer that because it's still... I was walking yesterday, and I was trying to process, thinking, \"I can't believe this is happening again and worse.\" It's not going to be the same. It's going to be worse. I really don't know how to answer that, besides the fact that, like you mentioned, I was in classrooms in a Midwest swing state [in 2016] and heard things like students saying, \"Miss, I'm not coming tomorrow; I'm going to be deported.\" It's interesting because last week, I was in Arizona doing a research study, and exactly the same phrase was used. So, it's deeply saddening, and I haven't fully processed it.\n\nCould I add, though, being in the classrooms in Arizona versus being in the classrooms in the previous study in the Midwestern state, I feel like, can I go back to the other classrooms? Because in Arizona, teachers were basically forbidden. One of the teachers told me we were muzzled to talk to our students about the election. So there was a lot of fear, and that fear wasn't addressed, so there was this stifling silence in the schools.\n\nWhen I began reading the book, I thought this was going to be a message to teachers and their pedagogy and what things should and shouldn't be done in the classroom. But I found that your book isn't just about teacher pedagogy but rather how institutions shape these racial identities and social structures.\n\nThanks for noticing that the book isn't trying to dictate what teachers should or shouldn't do. It is about showing how, often in hidden ways, schooling institutions create these ideas about racial categories. But to clarify, I'm less focused on individual identity formation and more on the formation of groups. That's a key distinction.\n\nIn the book, you spend a significant portion defining terms like race, ethnicity and racialization. Why was it necessary to invest so much time in clarification?\n\nThat's kind of the business of academia. As scholars, we need to explain what we mean by terms instead of assuming shared understanding. For example, if I use the term \"Latinx\" without explanation, readers might misinterpret its meaning. Being explicit about concepts helps guide understanding, especially when dealing with theory. It's interesting that you notice that because that's actually something that I also advocate in my other work, for scholars to be clear about how they conceptualize specific terms and concepts.\n\n\"I was in classrooms in a Midwest swing state [in 2016] and heard things like students saying, \"Miss, I'm not coming tomorrow; I'm going to be deported.\" It's interesting because last week, I was in Arizona doing a research study, and exactly the same phrase was used.\"\n\nIn the book, you mentioned using \"Latinx\" for political reasons.\n\nSo, I first heard Latinx when I was a doctoral student, and I liked it because I saw it as a gift from the queer and trans communities to challenge the gender binary and patriarchy. As time went on, I started hearing people use \"Latine,\" but the reasons I heard for using \"Latine\" weren't very appealing to me. As I kept reading other authors and their interpretations of the \"X\" in Latinx, I came across Claudia Milian's book \"LatinX.\" In that book, she mentions that one of the meanings of the \"X\" could be crossing out \"Latin,\" a word rooted in colonialism and Europe. I loved that idea.\n\nThis distinction is crucial because racialization is highly context-specific. For example, in Guatemala, there is a racialized group called Ladino (not Latino). If someone who identifies as Ladino in Guatemala moves to the U.S., that label doesn't translate or hold the same meaning here. Similarly, someone from Latin America identifying as \"Latino\" might find that the U.S. context racializes the term differently, and it doesn't carry the same understanding.\n\nSo, when I use \"Latinx,\" it signals to my readers that I'm talking about a racialized group within the specific context of the U.S., not about Latin Americans as a whole. That's why the \"X\" is meaningful -- it serves as a marker of this distinction.\n\nDoes your use of \"Latinx\" come up in your teaching?\n\nOh, definitely. I've noticed a trend among my students where they often use \"Latine,\" and they're curious about why I use \"Latinx.\" I explain my reasons to them, but I make it clear: I'm not trying to convince or convert them to use \"Latinx.\" I tell them, \"This is why I use it, but it's totally fine if you choose to use something else in your work.\" It's something I bring up to share my perspective, but I emphasize that they're free to have their own reasons and use whichever term they prefer.\n\nYou obviously speak to educators and students but something I found particularly interesting is that you also address parents. I see this text as not only essential for educators but also potentially valuable for parents. What should parents know about how schools shape racial identities?\n\nI did interview parents for the study, and I noticed that parents had different ideas about what should be taught in schools -- which, of course, isn't surprising. But for teachers to engage in this kind of work, there needs to be community support and parents are a key part of that community. It's crucial to remember their role in supporting teachers as they undertake this work. By \"this type of work,\" I mean helping students develop critical racial consciousness and addressing questions about race explicitly. Schools, as I argue in the book, already teach about race in implicit ways. However, we must also engage with race explicitly, advancing anti-racist thinking and critically examining race as a construct. Parents' support is essential in fostering this kind of education.\n\nHow can parents advocate for a more equitable and inclusive education for their children?\n\nOne of the things I noticed in my study was a meeting, maybe \"Town Hall\" is too formal a term, between parents, students, and teachers of the bilingual program. They met on a Saturday morning to discuss the program's history, importance and challenges, as well as to hear from both students and parents. What struck me most was that parents were very adamant about teachers needing to be 100% bilingual and highly proficient in Spanish. Their focus was entirely on language proficiency. I also heard similar sentiments from students I interviewed, some of whom chose not to participate in the program. For example, one student said, \"I don't want to be in the program because my teacher pollutes my Spanish.\"\n\nI mention this example because, during that meeting, no parent brought up the importance of teachers developing students' critical consciousness. The focus was solely on language -- ensuring students learned English and spoke perfect Spanish. I think this emphasis stems from a stigma about students being viewed as \"pocho\" or not having perfect Spanish.\n\nTo answer your question about how parents can advocate, they should show up at these meetings and expand the conversation. Of course, they can express the importance of bilingualism, but they should also emphasize the need for teachers to develop student awareness of societal injustices and their critical consciousness. That would be a significant step forward.\n\nI was also intrigued by the makeup of the teachers you chose, or who were selected, and the very interesting group of people that emerged. One seemed almost overtly racist, and it was fascinating to see how race shaped their perspective. The gender makeup of the educators was also notable.\n\nOne of the things I found interesting was the very small number of Latino, Latina or Latinx teachers in the program. The program had 15 teachers across two schools that I observed. Not all of them participated in the study, but I believe it was around 12 or 13 who did. However, the majority of the teachers were white or self-identified as white, which stood out to me. It was notable that, in a bilingual program in a Midwestern state, the teaching staff was still predominantly white. I say \"still\" because this pattern was consistent with what I observed outside the program as well.\n\nAnother interesting point was who was leading lessons that challenged racism and addressed social justice. As I mentioned, there were very few Latinx teachers in my study, so I didn't have many opportunities to observe whether they would approach these topics differently. There was also an immigrant teacher from Spain who incorporated some of these ideas in their classroom.\n\nThis study wasn't designed to assess whether white teachers are more critically conscious than Latinx teachers. What I did notice, in terms of patterns, was that the teachers leading critical lessons were mostly white. That's why I don't find that particular observation especially compelling.\n\nWhy did you avoid naming specific schools or states in the book?\n\nThere are very few bilingual programs at the secondary level, especially in middle and high schools. That's why I didn't name the state but it's also something I realized after the fact. I also appreciate that choice because I wasn't just focusing on one specific place; I'm talking about something that happens in schools everywhere. All schools in the U.S., in my opinion, contribute to shaping ideas about race. Because schools are central in our racialized society, they maintain and sometimes challenge ideas about race. They can reinforce these ideas or offer new perspectives, but they shape how we think about racial groups. So, while I don't specify the state, school or city, I wanted to provide an example that helps us think about how this process works more broadly. It may not look exactly the same in every place, but if we think about how schools make race, it's helpful to recognize that this isn't just something that happens in one city. It could be anywhere in the U.S.\n\nWould that at all be influenced by the fact that, to me, it's interesting you say this can happen anywhere in the U.S., regardless of the specific makeup of a city or state? The immediate question that comes to mind is that not all cities and states are the same, and not all educators have the same demographic makeup. So, I'm kind of challenging that idea: what does it say about the institutions pushing for a more diverse group of educators and students? When you say this can happen anywhere, does that mean the work being done to increase diversity has a broader significance?\n\nWhat I mean by saying this can happen anywhere is not that the specifics are the same, but that the process of racialization happens everywhere. The making of race and the teaching of race occur everywhere. It's not about the particulars; it's about the broader process. I assume we live in a racialized society, so even if this were Alaska, Hawaii or Florida, the U.S. has undergone a process of racializing its groups. The specifics could vary, different states might have different laws or approaches, but schools are teaching about race, whether implicitly or explicitly. The lessons may differ, but they're still about race.\n\nFor example, a school that offers ethnic studies and takes an anti-colonial, anti-imperialist stance is still teaching about race, even if the content and perspective differ. So, when I say this process happens everywhere, I'm talking about the underlying similarity, not the exact details.\n\n\"...in Arizona, teachers were basically forbidden. One of the teachers told me we were muzzled to talk to our students about the election. So there was a lot of fear, and that fear wasn't addressed, so there was this stifling silence in the schools.\"\n\nI noticed that your educational background highlighted the importance of culturally relevant, race-conscious teaching. Why did your educational journey become so important to you that you wrote about it?\n\nMy background as an educator is shaped by political events in the U.S. For example, the banning of bilingual education in California and Arizona had a significant impact on me during my time as both a high school and undergraduate student. I had always planned to become a teacher, but at that point, I wasn't sure whether I wanted to teach history or Spanish. When bilingual education was banned in Arizona, it really solidified my decision to become a Spanish teacher. I saw the ban as an attack on immigrants and the Latinx community, and that made it clear to me which path I wanted to pursue.\n\nI saw language as a very important issue for the community, which is why I chose to teach Spanish. Even from that point, it was something that mattered deeply to me. But being a teacher also had a major influence on how I think about the book. When I was teaching, my students talked about race all the time, through jokes and casual comments, it was something that came up constantly. However, as a teacher, I didn't always know how to address it in a productive or helpful way. Sometimes, I felt like I was teaching concepts but not scaffolding my students' thinking effectively. I'd either move too slowly or too quickly, and I wasn't prepared to teach about these complex issues. As many people know, these are very sensitive and taboo topics, and you can get into a lot of trouble if you don't handle them correctly. It takes a lot of bravery as a teacher, and sometimes I made big mistakes. But these experiences were also formative for me and helped shape how I think about these issues.\n\nI want to focus on the recommendations you make in the conclusion of your book, particularly when you discuss embracing theory. I found it insightful when you mention that individual teachers don't have all the answers. This really resonated with me because it highlights the vulnerability of educators and how that can be an asset.\n\nOne teacher I really admired shared that she knew she didn't have all the answers, but she wanted to explore the issues with her students, and I truly admired that. It takes a lot of courage, and she was a very brave educator. Many of her lessons were meaningful to her students. I believe teachers can support each other by collaborating and sharing ideas for these kinds of lessons. I'm a strong advocate for taking an inquiry stance in teaching, which helps educators improve their own practices. I learned this approach from Professor Marilyn Cochran-Smith and her work with Susan Lytle. It involves teachers being systematic and intentional about examining their teaching in collaboration with others, looking at student work, discussing how to challenge students and exploring ways to expand their thinking.\n\nThe best teacher preparation, in my opinion, focuses on helping teachers feel supported and confident enough to take risks in the classroom. Vulnerability in teaching often means taking risks, so to foster this, teachers need ample support and proper training.\n\nYou can buy a copy of \"How Schools Make Race: Teaching Latinx Racialization in America\" here."

        "content": "Language battles played out in the religious sphere too, with the formation of the Karnataka Catholic Christhara Sangha in the 1980s, Janaki said, with Kannada writers and intellectuals such as VK Gokak accusing the Catholic church of not providing services in Kannada and instead offering them in Tamil.\n\nMany economists have shown that India's turn towards neo-liberalisation in the 1990s ushered in a set of policies that resulted in the breakdown of agriculture across the country, leading to the start of distress migration. This was captured in the Census of 2011, which showed that for the first time in 90 years.\n\nProfessor and co-director at the Centre for Labour Studies at the National Law School of India University, Bengaluru, Babu Mathew, said that one must keep in mind that census data has shown that intra-state migration is far higher than inter-state migration. \"In rural India, agriculture is in distress. Employment opportunities in agriculture and in the non-farm sector have decreased. The only hope for survival lies in urban centres.\"\n\nFor employers looking for cheap labour, migrants, whether intra-state or inter-state, and regardless of the type of work they do, are ideal.\n\nMadhu too can see the exploitative tendency of an employer as clear as day. Asked about employers choosing migrants over locals whom they considered \"lazy,\" Madhu said, \"Look, big companies won't hire us because we will demand leave, food, and higher salaries. But people from other states will not. Our people (locals) will work eight hours. Wouldn't you want to work for eight hours and go home? But migrant workers live on the work site and will work for 12 hours.\"\n\nBabu said the desire among employers to hire the cheapest labour was part of the \"overall philosophy of the ease of doing business read with the race to the bottom.\"\n\nGiving an example of the garment sector in Bengaluru, with which he has worked extensively, Babu said the argument is often made that if the industry has to survive in India, it must compete with Bangladesh, and therefore wages here must be lower than those in Bangladesh, or else the businesses will go to Bangladesh. \"This is called the race to the bottom, and it is being used for the purpose of decreasing wages and preventing the improvement of working conditions. As it is, the garment industry has the lowest minimum wage among 100 types of employment in Karnataka.\"\n\nBut he cautioned that a way must be found to balance the constitutional right to freedom of movement with the right of people to not be exploited by their employers.\n\nGovernment policy, political posturing\n\nSuccessive state governments were indecisive and sometimes held on to disastrous language policies. The ill-effects of these decisions are felt even to this day.\n\nKarnataka adopted the three-language formula promoted by the Union government in 1968 at a time when it was becoming clear that English was the gateway to economic and social mobility. Under the formula, north Indian states were to teach Hindi, English, and a modern language, preferably a south Indian one, while the south Indian states would teach their respective languages along with Hindi and English.\n\nChandan Gowda said that during this time, due to opposition to Hindi, Sanskrit was as the first language in education and Kannada was taught as the third language. In 1972, the then Chief Minister Devaraj Urs made Kannada the first language and Sanskrit the third. When Gundu Rao became the state's first Brahmin Chief Minister in 1980, he re-introduced Sanskrit as a first language, removing Kannada and English from the first language choices. Faced with a massive backlash and of \"Brahminical bias,\" he appointed Jnanpith awardee VK Gokak to study the language problem. The committee submitted its report in January 1981 and recommended a three-language formula with Kannada as the sole first language.\n\nHowever, Gundu Rao sat on the recommendations for some time. His inaction provoked protests in 1982, which came to be called the . Celebrated actor Rajkumar's entry into the Gokak agitation gave the Kannada movement, which was until then largely driven by writers and intellectuals, a truly mass character.\n\nTill today, Karnataka has a three-language policy in primary education, which has left the state government open to accusations of being \"soft\" and invited unfavourable comparisons with Tamil Nadu's approach of a two-language policy.\n\nProf Basavaraja Kodagunti said that Karnataka decided on a three-language policy at a time when there was a general feeling across the country that such a policy must be adopted. The then-ruling Congress and the local leadership simply fell in line with the Union's policies.\n\nIt was never reversed because politicians in Karnataka built their political careers in national parties. \"It's only when a political party turns Karnataka into an ideology that you can call it a Karnataka-centric party. Our politicians cannot think along those lines because of their backgrounds in the ideologies of national parties. So they don't give much importance to the reversal of the three-language policy,\" he said.\n\nAlong with this, people in the state have had to deal with what Bengaluru-based activist Shivasundar was a bias towards Hindi that was built into the Constitution in Article 351. Successive Union governments attempted to push Hindi down the throats of non-Hindi speakers through all kinds of policies. This has only increased under the Narendra Modi-led government since 2014.\n\nChandan said that while the BJP promotes Hindi at the national level, the local BJP leaders in Karnataka attempt damage control. \"Amit Shah will say we'll push Hindi, and the local BJP will say something else and confuse everybody. When Narendra Modi comes to Karnataka, he speaks in Hindi, but when he goes to Tamil Nadu, he speaks in English.\"\n\nThese may be confusing signals, but the BJP is wary that its pro-Hindi plans can actually hurt it, Chandan said. \"So it's trying to do both things: talk about national unity and also Kannada.\"\n\nEven with regard to the hoisting of the Kannada flag, the BJP was caught on the backfoot during its previous tenure. \"On the flag, the BJP's pushback is very clear: all the ministers refused to hoist it in government buildings, but Siddaramaiah did, and that was a big symbolic gesture,\" Chandan said.\n\nBut it would be a mistake to look at the flag issue in terms of electoral prospects. \"Take the Metro signage pushback; did it mean more votes for the Congress in the election that happened afterwards? Did the BJP lose any votes because of that?\"\n\nChandan said Bengaluru politicians are not likely to make Kannada an election issue. \"The city's MLAs do not want to push for it very strongly because the constituencies are linguistically diverse. Outside Bengaluru, this is not an issue. People talk about it, but it is not something that weighs very heavily on people's minds.\"\n\nAn unsettled present\n\nFor Ganesh and many other activists, Hindi is not a villain. \"The movement is not against other languages per se but is a proactive fight for Kannada rights. While social media has played a significant role in spreading the message, not all the noise online is representative of real issues. Some non-Kannadigas or outsiders may be using the situation for personal gain, such as increasing impressions on monetised tweets, but for genuine Kannada activists, the issues they're fighting for are much deeper and long-standing,\" Ganesh said.\n\nState organising secretary of the Karnataka Rakshana Vedike Arun Javgal says that the \"north Indian\" media often play up incidents such as the recent one in which a north Indian woman accused an auto driver of slapping her during an argument and ignore more substantial issues such as Hindi imposition and the treatment of the Union government of non-Hindi-speaking states.\n\n\"What the auto driver did was wrong; he shouldn't have talked to a woman like that. But why did an argument on the street become national news?\" asks Arun.\n\nAccording to him, the delimitation and the drop in the total fertility rates of the southern states would have an adverse impact on these states.\n\n\"From the Parliament to the railway station, there is discrimination everywhere. When our own elected governments discriminate against us, it is not news. But we can't even call this discrimination because it is built into the Constitution and the Union cites that and gets away with it,\" Arun said. He also castigated the state's political establishment for remaining silent on these issues. \"Don't Siddaramaiah, Yediyurappa, and Kumaraswamy know these issues? Do they have the guts to raise their voice against this?\"\n\nArun says that he and others have joined forces with speakers of languages which are clubbed under Hindi in the census. \"Today, we are not fighting Hindi imposition. What we want is that all languages get recognition as official languages of the Union under Article 343 of the Constitution, and that it becomes the responsibility of the Union government to promote all languages under Article 351 and not just Hindi. If we fight to make all languages official, then Hindi imposition will stop.\"\n\nFilmmaker Milton Peter, who is also active on social media, fears the Kannada movement needs to be wary of being co-opted by Hindutva activists. \"The BJP IT cell tries to highlight any small incident in a non-BJP state. Every small thing from Karnataka has started to become a huge thing because the BJP wants to portray the Congress as the bad guy. We need to stick to linguistic rights and argue from a linguistic rights perspective. Otherwise, things will just move towards xenophobia.\"\n\nAlthough there is no panacea that will assuage the multiple anxieties about the relevance and survival of Kannada, many feel that a bilingual policy, if done right, might be a start.\n\n\"I think symbolically a bilingual policy will make a lot of difference. It's a question of unfairness. If three languages are good for the country, then have it everywhere. Why is it possible for Tamil Nadu and north India to say we will have only two languages? And why are we (Karnataka) under a special obligation to do these things? It's a fair question to ask,\" Chandan said.\n\nJanaki said that there are many issues to address. \"Of late, the language of the streets is Hindi. The aggressive push of the current Union government to promote Hindi has undermined even the state's efforts to sustain and promote Kannada,\" she told TNM.\n\nShe also said a primary education policy that is \"robustly bilingual (in schools and later in workplaces), with no concessions made to elite schools, etc., and the encouragement of cultural skilling in different kinds of workplaces in imaginative ways will go a long way in protecting the future of the language. It will call on those brilliant literary figures who despair about the future of Kannada to develop forms of communication that will enrich public life and private conversations equally, in democratic ways, and not through government fiat.\""

They identified four main strategies: one-parent-one-language, both-parents-bilingual, one-parent-bilingual (where one parent used both languages and the other used one) and one-language-at-home (where one language is used at home and another one is used outside the home, such as at daycare).\n\n\"We found that none of these strategies told us much about what the children actually heard at home.

And underinvestment by the Legislature, paired with a hamstrung state Education Department, has limited the pace of bilingual education's comeback.\n\nIn 1953, Bárbara Flores entered kindergarten at Washington Elementary School in Madera, California, a small city in the Central Valley surrounded by farm fields. Her mother and grandmother had talked it up: You're going to learn a lot. You're going to like it. She believed them. A little girl who would one day become a teacher, Flores was excited.\n\nBut only until she got there.\n\n\"I walked out,\" Flores recalled recently. She got to her grandmother's house a few blocks away, furious. \"Son mentirosas,\" she said. \"No entiendo nada. Y jamas voy a regresar.\" You're liars. I don't understand anything. And I'm never going back.\n\nFlores only spoke Spanish. As the grandchild of Mexican immigrants, she didn't find her language or culture welcome in the school. But little Bárbara didn't get her way. And, after depositing her daughter back in the classroom, Flores' mother asked the teacher a question: Aren't you paying attention? My daughter walked out. The answer felt like a slap and became a part of family lore. All these little Mexican girls look alike. I didn't notice.\n\nFlores returned to her old school this fall; the building she walked out of still stands, but almost everything else has changed. Now students speak Spanish because their teachers require them to. Little Mexican girls see their culture celebrated on the walls of every classroom.\n\nWashington students will graduate knowing how to speak, read and write in both Spanish and English, joining a growing number of \"dual-language immersion\" schools in California. Flores' eyes open wide as she describes the about-face her alma mater has taken.\n\n\"We were punished for speaking Spanish,\" she said. \"We were hit with rulers, pinched, our braids were pulled. Now the whole school is dual-language.\"\n\nThe path has not been linear. When Flores was a child, California still had an English-only law on the books from the 1800s. As governor, Ronald Reagan signed a bill eliminating it. Then the Civil Rights Movement ushered in a new era of bilingual education, and the California Legislature went further, requiring the model for students still learning English from 1976 until the anti-immigrant backlash of the 1990s. Voters banned it again in 1998, only reversing the latest prohibition in 2016.\n\nResearchers have found bilingual education helps students learn English faster and can boost their standardized test scores, increase graduation rates, better prepare them for college and much more. California has removed the official barriers to offering this type of instruction since 2016, and the state now champions bilingualism and biliteracy, encouraging all students to strive for both. But eight years after repeal, California schools have yet to recover. A decades-long enrollment slump in bilingual-teacher prep programs has led to a decimated teacher pipeline. And underinvestment by the Legislature, paired with a hamstrung state Education Department, has limited the pace of bilingual education's comeback.\n\nThe result? A rare case in which Californians can say Texas is inspiring. Both states enroll more than 1 million students still learning English -- but last year, the Lone Star State put 40% of them in bilingual classrooms. California managed that for just 10%.\n\nIn 1987, Flores didn't think state policy would go this way. At the time, both states required bilingual education. She was a professor, helping build a bilingual-education teacher prep program at Cal State San Bernardino. Her home state could have kept pace with Texas.\n\nBut it didn't.\n\nBy 1998, the bilingual-teacher prep program was flourishing. Flores helped aspiring teachers understand how students learn to read and write in two languages, sending them off into classrooms with binders full of instructional tips. Her daughter, then 10, was learning both English and Spanish through bilingual classes in the San Bernardino City Unified School District. Flores was on a parent committee organizing broader support for such programs in the face of a statewide campaign to get rid of them, bankrolled by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Ron Unz.\n\nProposition 227, which passed with 61% of the vote, required schools to teach only in English with students who were still learning the language, something that may sound like a good idea but often ends up unnecessarily putting students' grade-level learning of other subjects on pause while they master English. Flores saw the impact immediately. Faculty on campus called for the elimination of her program, an effort that ultimately failed but showed, she said, \"the intensity of the discrimination and language racism that was prevalent.\" Enrollment in bilingual-teacher prep programs across the state plummeted.\n\nFlores also watched local school districts respond. \"I was shocked at superintendents in the area,\" she said. \"They just made everybody throw away their Spanish books. It was horrendous.\" As she recalls, every single school district in the Inland Empire got rid of its bilingual programs except San Bernardino City Unified, where parent activism helped ensure the district took advantage of an exception to the new law.\n\nAt the time, student achievement data from San Bernardino City Unified had shown that bilingual programs were helping kids succeed. And over the next two decades, researchers studying programs across the United States released a steady stream of evidence about the benefits of bilingual education, especially a version called \"dual language.\" Traditional bilingual education essentially lets students use their first language while they learn English. Once students become fluent, their schools shift entirely to English instruction, which was the goal all along. Dual-language programs, by contrast, set bilingualism as the goal. Students continue to take courses in Spanish or another language for about half of the school day until they leave the program.\n\nWhile dual-language programs often stop after elementary school, the \"bilingual advantage\" stretches through students' K-12 years and into their working lives. Dual-language students have been found to score higher than their peers on both math and English language arts exams by middle school. They also get higher scores on the ACT in high school, setting them up to be more competitive in college admissions. And importantly, a team at Stanford found that native Spanish speakers were more likely to test out of English-learner services if they took bilingual classes, a coveted goal because of how well \"former English learners\" do. University of Chicago researchers just released data showing that Chicago high schoolers in this group had higher-than-average GPAs and SAT scores, high school graduation rates, and community college enrollment and persistence rates.\n\nPatricia Gándara co-directs the UCLA Civil Rights Project, which has published similar findings, and has spent decades of her career cataloging the bilingual advantage. She laments the narrow value placed on bilingual education in the U.S., where it has historically been pursued as a way to help kids who don't speak English learn the language more quickly and then succeed in English-only classes.\n\n\"That's a very shortsighted view,\" Gándara said, \"particularly from the research that we've done that shows kids who get a strong bilingual education are more likely to go to college, they're more likely to complete college, they're more likely to have better jobs and better opportunities.\"\n\nYet while policymakers didn't catch on right away, well-off and well-educated white parents did, seeing the economic benefits of bilingualism for their children very clearly.\n\nGlendale Unified School District launched its first Spanish-English dual-language program in 2003, going on to add programs in six other languages while official state policy was to ban them. Last year, 85% of the students enrolled were fluent English speakers, according to program director Nancy Hong.\n\nImmigrant families, weighed down by the pressure to speak English and make sure their children do too, have been hard to recruit. Hong said immigrant parents have long been concerned that letting their children spend half the school day or more hearing their home language will get in the way of learning English, even though research has shown it can make the whole process go faster. \"The goal is to dismantle those myths and misperceptions,\" she said. But even though about 20% of students districtwide are English learners, only about 10% of them are in dual-language programs.\n\nMany immigrant families, however, have become strong advocates for the programs. José Sanjas, a Mexican-born father in Madera Unified School District, takes his 6-year-old daughter past her neighborhood school every day en route to one of the district's dual-language programs. He and his wife want to preserve their native language as their daughter grows up here, but the draw isn't only personal; Sanjas also sees how bilingualism will benefit his daughter in the workplace.\n\n\"She can help more people in the future,\" Sanjas said. \"Professionally, she'll be able to serve everyone.\"\n\nSpurred on by support like his, a diverse coalition of school leaders in Madera Unified had, by 2016, come to see dual-language education as key to turning around the district's chronically low performance, especially among the children of immigrants. Flores had helped make the case, inviting school board members to the annual conference of the California Association for Bilingual Education. And in Flores' hometown, U.S.-born, white families were among those speaking up in support of the programs, knowing even if the immigrant students' test scores had the most room to grow, their children could benefit too.\n\nStatewide, public opinion had swung in the other direction; that November, about 74% of California voters said yes to Proposition 58, officially allowing bilingual education back in California classrooms.\n\n\"It was a relief we [could] finally move forward for our children,\" Flores said. \"We lost a whole generation of kids -- quite a few generations, really -- because of English-only.\"\n\nThe next generation, however, is still waiting.\n\nFlores spent 40 years training future teachers before retiring in 2019. Across three institutions and 32 years at Cal State San Bernardino, she likely taught 10,000 students, many of whom remain sprinkled throughout the state's bilingual-education system. But if anything defines the legacy of Prop. 227, it is the shattered teacher pipeline it left in its wake.\n\nGándara, of the UCLA Civil Rights Project, said the current state of affairs is \"one of those stories of 'I told you so.' ... I could see what the problem was going to be: that when people came back to their senses and realized what a mistake this was, the big fallout was going to be that we didn't have the teachers.\"\n\nCalifornia colleges are not producing nearly enough teachers to meet the state's bilingual-education goals. During the 2022-23 school year, the state commission on teacher credentialing only authorized 1,011 new bilingual teachers -- across all languages. Only seven went to teachers who speak Vietnamese, the second-most-common language in California schools that year. And it actually gave out fewer credentials to Spanish-speaking teachers that year than in the three years prior.\n\nThe Legislature has not ignored this problem entirely. In 2017, it funded six grants, totaling $20 million, to help districts coach up bilingual staffers and prepare them to lead bilingual classrooms. But Edgar Lampkin, CEO of the California Association for Bilingual Education, said seeding such \"grow your own\" programs falls far short of addressing the statewide need. \"That's not systemic,\" he said.\n\nIn 2022, the National Resource Center for Asian Languages, based at Cal State Fullerton, got state money to train 200 teachers over five years. They're on track, and the center's director, Natalie Tran, is proud that their programs are not only increasing the number of teachers certified to teach in Asian languages, but also diversifying the languages they speak. She expects to certify teachers who speak Tagalog, Hmong and Khmer this school year. Still, she said, the state needs to do more to train additional teachers of Asian languages, including the less common ones. \"We're going to need help from policymakers to make this happen,\" Tran said.\n\nShe isn't the only one calling on lawmakers to be part of the solution. Anya Hurwitz is executive director of SEAL, a nonprofit that got its start as an initiative of the Sobrato Family Foundation to address achievement gaps between immigrant and native-born children in Silicon Valley. She says the state underfunds education, which gets in the way of doing what's best for kids who don't speak English.\n\nIn 2022, the last year for which federal census data is available, New York spent almost $30,000 per student. California spent about $17,000. And besides its support for teacher training, the Legislature has only given districts $10 million extra to start or expand dual-language programs. In Massachusetts, home to about one-tenth the number of kids still learning English, the Legislature disbursed $11.8 million for the same work, kicking off its own recovery from an English-only law.\n\n\"Funding is not the solution to everything in and of itself,\" Hurwitz said, \"but at the same time, we can't build capacity without funding and resources.\"\n\nBack in Flores' hometown, Madera administrators have been able to use state and federal money earmarked for their sizable number of immigrant families and those living in poverty to achieve their dual-language goals. But startup costs for dual-language programs are expensive. Teacher preparation programs, Superintendent Todd Lile said, are not producing graduates who are ready to do this work, leaving districts like his with steep professional development costs.\n\nA residency program with Cal State Fresno has given Madera a solid pipeline of teachers, but the recent grads have to clear all the usual hurdles of being new to the profession while also adapting to using Spanish in the classroom. While these new hires at Washington Elementary School grew up bilingual, they went to school through the Prop. 227 years, meaning most of them didn't develop an academic vocabulary in Spanish.\n\nViviana Valerio, a kindergarten teacher, said that history made bilingual education an intimidating proposition. \"I commonly speak Spanish at home, but then when I was thinking about teaching, I was thinking, 'OK, academic terms, I don't know how to translate that,' or 'Parents ask me a question and I can't think of it, I'm going to want to transition into English,'\" she said. \"For me, that was the scary part.\"\n\nTexas, too, lacks bilingual-education teachers, echoing a shortage present in much of the country, but the state is far ahead of California; many districts are able to recruit their own alumni because their programs have been around so long. Texas also continues to invest in bilingual education, helping districts comply with state mandates to offer it. Like California, Texas gives districts more per-pupil funding for every student still learning English; unlike California, Texas offers an additional premium for each of them enrolled in a dual-language program.\n\nAs an extra incentive to start and maintain these programs, Texas has started bumping up funding for the native English speakers enrolled too. Research shows the programs work better when classes are evenly split between native English speakers and speakers of the program's second language. Then, not only are students learning their second language from the teacher but from their peers as well. Conveniently, this also makes for more integrated classrooms, something Gándara said California needs.\n\n\"We haven't been able to take advantage of that, in large part because people don't pay attention to Indeed, districts across the state cite staffing as a major barrier to starting or expanding their programs. Some have gone abroad to recruit. Others have been forced to scrap their plans entirely. Newark Unified School District, in the Bay Area, got rid of its dual-language program this year because it couldn't find teachers to staff it. \"We tried everything,\" said Karen Allard, assistant superintendent of education services.\n\nFor more than a decade now, the state's Education Department has tried to champion bilingual programs. Students who can prove their fluency in two languages before graduation get a special seal on their diplomas. The department also implores schools to help the children of immigrants maintain their home language while learning English, building that recommendation into its 2017 English Learner Roadmap. By 2030, it wants half of California students on a path to becoming bilingual.\n\nYet all of this largely amounts to cheerleading. The department is minimally funded and staffed, a result of the state's commitment to sending almost all K-12 funding directly to school districts, and its support for bilingual education has not come with any firm demands.\n\nConor Williams, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank based in Washington, D.C., recently found himself -- a self-described \"professional lefty\" -- in the surprising position of celebrating Texas' policy over California's. Besides following Texas' lead on funding, he said, California should rethink teacher licensing. The state requires college graduates to pass a suite of tests to become teachers, but Williams points out the tests don't lead to better instruction and can keep good teachers from classrooms. Getting rid of the requirement could bring more bilingual adults into the profession and expand the teacher pipeline.\n\nHard to overcome, however, is California's shift toward more local control over schooling. Williams doesn't always agree with what the Texas education department does with its power, but the state's centralized approach means it has \"enough power and muscle and will to set rules and hold districts to them,\" he said. California's Local Control Funding Formula is widely popular and has ensured districts get more state money to serve students still learning English as well as those in foster care and low-income households. But, Williams points out, local control has its limits.\n\n\"You don't win civil rights battles by leaving it up to local school boards,\" he said.\n\nthat as a major issue and also because we don't have the teachers to pull it off,\" Gándara said.\n\nStill, districts like Madera are moving ahead on their own. In 2020, Flores' alma mater, Washington Elementary, became Madera Unified's second dual-language school, welcoming its first class of kindergartners who are expected to leave proficient in both English and Spanish.\n\nMateo Diaz Zanjas was one of them. He's now a fourth-grader and speaks in easy Spanish about the school and his long-term dream of going to Harvard. Upon hearing that he and his peers speak very good Spanish, he eagerly replies: \"We also speak good English.\" And he proves it, going on to answer questions in English about his favorite subjects and the languages he speaks with certain friends.\n\nAdministrators, however, are still waiting for the data to show that their bet on bilingual education will pay off in student achievement gains. The pandemic interrupted their early years and set them back, and the oldest students aren't doing as well as district leaders would have hoped. Commitment to the programs, however, has not waivered. Students' overall test scores remain low, but their growth scores -- or how much they learn over the course of the year -- are high.\n\nThe district is helping students learn English more quickly, too, meaning they are becoming \"former English learners\" faster with the newer supports and joining the district's highest-performing student group.\n\nIn the meantime, Madera teachers are using bilingual education to give Spanish speakers grade-level material, knowing that once they sharpen their English skills, all that information will transfer.\n\n\"Kids can learn math in Spanish; it's still math,\" Lile said. \"They can learn social studies in Spanish; it's still history and geography. These subject matters don't exist only in English.\"\n\nDuring Flores' recent visit to Madera Unified, she heard Lile describe his long-term goals for the district, including higher graduation rates and better college readiness for the children of immigrants. She looked on proudly, sure her hometown district was finally getting it right.\n\nA few years ago, Flores introduced Lile to Margarita Machado-Casas, a professor at San Diego State's Department of Dual Language and English Learner Education, which has long been a top producer of the state's bilingual teachers. Machado-Casas is helping the district figure out what concrete steps teachers and administrators should take to follow the high-level recommendations of the state's English Learner Roadmap. They started out with \"Principle 1,\" which asks school and district staffers to see immigrant students' language and culture as assets rather than seeing their lack of English proficiency as a deficit. Pointing to Madera's long and painful history of discriminating against immigrant students, including Flores, Machado-Casas said this principle unexpectedly took the entire first year, requiring \"courageous conversations\" -- including asking staffers to think deeply about whether they believed in the work enough to stay in the district.\n\nMachado-Casas is helping educators in Madera understand both how to help immigrant students tackle grade-level material and convince them that the students can handle it.\n\nFlores hopes the work ends up being a playbook for the entire state -- which could soon need one. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill this year requiring the Education Department to come up with a statewide plan for helping districts adopt the road map's guidelines and report on their progress.\n\nThis planning process guarantees California will be over a decade into its recovery from the English-only years before the state even considers holding schools accountable for changing their practices. When New York passed a blueprint for how to serve English learners in 2014, it followed it up with new state regulations that same year, creating stricter policies for serving students who were still learning English, including a broader mandate for bilingual education, which had already been required for decades.\n\nAlesha Moreno-Ramirez leads the California Education Department's multilingual support division. She said state budget limitations have gotten in the way of implementing the English Learner Roadmap and said any call to require bilingual education like Texas or New York would have to come from the Legislature, not the department. \"That said, we would enthusiastically support the movement toward requiring bilingual education,\" she added.\n\nAdvocates caution such a mandate would have to come with enough funding to help districts create high-quality programs, but many agree it would be a win for California students. Children from immigrant families speak 108 different languages, according to the Education Department, but 93% of them speak one of 10. To require bilingual programs, the Legislature would likely tweak the current law, which says if the parents of 30 or more students in a single school request a language acquisition program, the school has to offer it \"to the extent possible.\" Texas, Illinois and New York have similar laws, but instead of requiring bilingual programs in response to parent advocacy, they do so based solely on enrollment.\n\nFlores thinks the state is at least moving in the right direction. And Madera Unified gives her hope. During her recent visit, she was flooded with memories: She saw the tree she and her friends used to circle while playing \"Ring Around the Rosie.\" She visited the classroom she walked out of as a 5-year-old, where the walls are now decorated with vocabulary in Spanish as well as English. She suffered in that room 70 years ago. Now, little Mexican girls do not.\n\n\"We don't stop,\" she said. \"We keep plugging away. That's our tenacity. That's our grit. And our motivation, of course, is for our children.\""

        "content": "It has been eight years since California voters repealed a 1998 law directing public school districts to essentially eliminate their bilingual programs. But the fallout from the state's vacillating history of bilingual education has led to California falling short of providing a quality education not only to non-English speakers but also to students who want to be bilingual.\n\nAs CalMatters higher education reporter Tara García Mathewson explains, in 1998 California voters approved a law requiring schools to teach classes only in English with students who were not fluent with the language, with few exceptions. Latino state lawmakers and teachers' unions pushed to repeal that law, which voters did in 2016.\n\nThere are many benefits for schools to have bilingual education: It allows students who are not proficient in English to still be able to learn school subjects in their native language while they also learn English. Schools with strong dual-language programs, a type of bilingual instruction approach, also report better student outcomes, including higher test scores and graduation rates. And bilingual students develop strong cognitive skills and have more job opportunities.\n\nBut while both California and Texas each enroll more than 1 million students still learning English, California managed to put just 10% of them in bilingual classrooms last year -- compared to 40% in Texas.\n\nOne reason for this lag is a lack of teachers. The 1998 law largely extinguished programs that could train teachers to lead bilingual K-12 classrooms.\n\nTo enroll more students in bilingual education, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law this year requiring the education department to develop a plan for districts to adopt the state's English Learner Roadmap. The Legislature also allocated in 2017 roughly $20 million to help districts prepare bilingual staffers to lead bilingual classrooms, and budgeted another $10 million in 2021 to start or expand dual-language programs.\n\nBut advocates say it's not enough. In Massachusetts, for example, the Legislature budgeted $11.8 million for similar initiatives, though it enrolls about one-tenth the number of kids still learning English compared to California."

        "content": "California has banned bilingual education on and off since the 1800s. The state is now 8 years into allowing it again but still hasn't managed to get all that many kids into good programs.\n\nCalifornia first demanded public education be conducted exclusively in English in 1872, a policy that stayed on the books until Ronald Reagan, as governor, signed a law to get rid of it in 1967. About a decade later, the state started to require bilingual education for kids who couldn't understand English, taking up a Civil Rights-era argument that the children of immigrants deserved an education in their native language to be able to get the full benefits of public schooling. Other immigrant-heavy states passed the same requirements, including Texas, Illinois, and New York. But California made a radical break with its peers in 1998 when voters approved another English-only law. For nearly two decades, bilingual education became increasingly popular among native English speakers and celebrated as a best-practice for educating the children of immigrants, but the nation's most linguistically diverse state continued to ban it.\n\nWe investigated the fallout of that ban and the state's limping recovery since voters repealed it in 2016, conducting nearly three dozen interviews with researchers, policymakers, state education officials, advocates, bilingual educators, school leaders, teachers, parents, and students in California as well as education leaders in Texas, Illinois, and Colorado, where bilingual education has been a priority in state education policy for decades, and in Massachusetts, which is recovering from a 15-year-long ban of its own.\n\nBilingual education lets kids use their native language while they learn English. Kids who already know how to read and write in one language just have to transfer those skills to a second language rather than learning the processes from scratch. Taking classes in their native language while they're learning English also lets kids tackle more complex topics in their first language rather than having to put that off until they master English.\n\nDual-language programs set all students up for the \"bilingual advantage.\" Traditional bilingual education creates a pathway to English-only classes as quickly as possible. Succeeding in English-language classes is the goal. Increasingly popular dual-language programs, by contrast, have kids splitting the school day between two languages for their entire schooling, preparing them to reap the benefits of bilingualism in their lives and work long-term.\n\nDual language programs boost student outcomes. Districts with strong dual-language programs report significantly higher standardized test scores for students in those programs compared to students in general education programs. The leaps in student achievement show up by middle school. Researchers have found these programs lead to higher college entrance exam scores, high school graduation rates, and college-going rates. For kids who enter the programs not speaking English, they lead to faster English proficiency.\n\nDual-language programs create more integrated schools. Because dual-language programs have become so popular among English-speaking families, they represent a way to integrate classrooms with recent immigrants and those whose families came to this country generations ago.\n\nThe state has taken steps to champion bilingual education. In 2017, the Education Department released an English Learner Roadmap, urging schools to help students who don't speak English maintain their native languages while mastering English. In 2019, the Global California 2030 initiative named concrete goals for how soon the state's schools should foster widespread bilingualism: By 2030, half of California students should be on a path to becoming bilingual and 1,600 schools should be running dual-language programs (more than double the number doing so in 2018).\n\nBut the state's aspirations for bilingual education are running up against a severe teacher shortage. During the 2022-23 school year, the state commission on teacher credentialing only authorized 1,011 new bilingual teachers -- across all languages. Only seven went to teachers who speak Vietnamese, the second-most-common language in California schools that year. It gave out fewer credentials to Spanish-speaking teachers that year than in the three years prior.\n\nPatricia Gándara, a longtime bilingual education researcher and co-director of the UCLA Civil Rights Project, called the decimated teacher pipeline \"one of those stories of 'I told you so.' ... I could see what the problem was going to be: that when people came back to their senses and realized what a mistake this was, the big fallout was going to be that we didn't have the teachers.\"\n\nBilingual education advocates say the Legislature needs to do more.The Legislature has put $20 million toward helping districts coach up bilingual teachers and prepare them to lead bilingual classrooms and another $10 million to help districts start or expand dual-language programs. Advocates say it's not enough.\n\nStatewide accountability may be coming. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill this year requiring the Education Department to come up with a statewide plan for helping districts adopt the English Learner Roadmap's guidelines and report on districts' progress.\n\nSupporters of bilingual education find inspiration in Texas, which never stopped requiring these programs and more recently created financial incentives for districts to start and expand dual-language programs as an even better model. Alesha Moreno-Ramirez, director of the Education Department's Multilingual Support Division, said the Legislature would need to make the call to require bilingual education in California or create financial incentives for it.\n\n\"That said, we would enthusiastically support the movement toward requiring bilingual education,\" she added."

        "content": "The nation's most linguistically diverse state has a tortured history with bilingual education in public schools. The Education Department can't -- and the Legislature won't -- do what it takes to repair the damage.\n\nIn 1953, Bárbara Flores entered kindergarten at Washington Elementary School in Madera, California, a small city in the Central Valley surrounded by farm fields. Her mother and grandmother had talked it up: You're going to learn a lot. You're going to like it. She believed them. A little girl who would one day become a teacher, Flores was excited.\n\nBut only until she got there.\n\n\"I walked out,\" Flores recalled recently. She got to her grandmother's house a few blocks away, furious. \"Son mentirosas,\" she said. \"No entiendo nada. Y jamas voy a regresar.\" You're liars. I don't understand anything. And I'm never going back.\n\nFlores only spoke Spanish. As the grandchild of Mexican immigrants, she didn't find her language or culture welcome in the school. But little Bárbara didn't get her way. And, after depositing her daughter back in the classroom, Flores' mother asked the teacher a question: Aren't you paying attention? My daughter walked out. The answer felt like a slap and became a part of family lore. All these little Mexican girls look alike. I didn't notice.\n\nFlores returned to her old school this fall; the building she walked out of still stands, but almost everything else has changed. Now students speak Spanish because their teachers require them to. Little Mexican girls see their culture celebrated on the walls of every classroom.\n\nWashington students will graduate knowing how to speak, read and write in both Spanish and English, joining a growing number of \"dual-language immersion\" schools in California. Flores' eyes open wide as she describes the about-face her alma mater has taken.\n\n\"We were punished for speaking Spanish,\" she said. \"We were hit with rulers, pinched, our braids were pulled. Now the whole school is dual-language.\"\n\nThe path has not been linear. When Flores was a child, California still had an English-only law on the books from the 1800s. As governor, Ronald Reagan signed a bill eliminating it. Then the Civil Rights Movement ushered in a new era of bilingual education, and the California Legislature went further, requiring the model for students still learning English from 1976 until the anti-immigrant backlash of the 1990s. Voters banned it again in 1998, only reversing the latest prohibition in 2016.\n\nResearchers have found bilingual education helps students learn English faster and can boost their standardized test scores, increase graduation rates, better prepare them for college and much more. California has removed the official barriers to offering this type of instruction since 2016, and the state now champions bilingualism and biliteracy, encouraging all students to strive for both. But eight years after repeal, California schools have yet to recover. A decades-long enrollment slump in bilingual-teacher prep programs has led to a decimated teacher pipeline. And underinvestment by the Legislature, paired with a hamstrung state Education Department, has limited the pace of bilingual education's comeback.\n\nThe result? A rare case in which Californians can say Texas is inspiring. Both states enroll more than 1 million students still learning English -- but last year, the Lone Star State put 40% of them in bilingual classrooms. California managed that for just 10%.\n\nIn 1987, Flores didn't think state policy would go this way. At the time, both states required bilingual education. She was a professor, helping build a bilingual-education teacher prep program at Cal State San Bernardino. Her home state could have kept pace with Texas.\n\nBut it didn't.\n\nBy 1998, the bilingual-teacher prep program was flourishing. Flores helped aspiring teachers understand how students learn to read and write in two languages, sending them off into classrooms with binders full of instructional tips. Her daughter, then 10, was learning both English and Spanish through bilingual classes in the San Bernardino City Unified School District. Flores was on a parent committee organizing broader support for such programs in the face of a statewide campaign to get rid of them, bankrolled by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Ron Unz.\n\nProposition 227, which passed with 61% of the vote, required schools to teach only in English with students who were still learning the language, something that may sound like a good idea but often ends up unnecessarily putting students' grade-level learning of other subjects on pause while they master English. Flores saw the impact immediately. Faculty on campus called for the elimination of her program, an effort that ultimately failed but showed, she said, \"the intensity of the discrimination and language racism that was prevalent.\" Enrollment in bilingual-teacher prep programs across the state plummeted.\n\nFlores also watched local school districts respond. \"I was shocked at superintendents in the area,\" she said. \"They just made everybody throw away their Spanish books. It was horrendous.\" As she recalls, every single school district in the Inland Empire got rid of its bilingual programs except San Bernardino City Unified, where parent activism helped ensure the district took advantage of an exception to the new law.\n\nAt the time, student achievement data from San Bernardino City Unified had shown that bilingual programs were helping kids succeed. And over the next two decades, researchers studying programs across the United States released a steady stream of evidence about the benefits of bilingual education, especially a version called \"dual language.\" Traditional bilingual education essentially lets students use their first language while they learn English. Once students become fluent, their schools shift entirely to English instruction, which was the goal all along. Dual-language programs, by contrast, set bilingualism as the goal. Students continue to take courses in Spanish or another language for about half of the school day until they leave the program.\n\nWhile dual-language programs often stop after elementary school, the \"bilingual advantage\" stretches through students' K-12 years and into their working lives. Dual-language students have been found to score higher than their peers on both math and English language arts exams by middle school. They also get higher scores on the ACT in high school, setting them up to be more competitive in college admissions. And importantly, a team at Stanford found that native Spanish speakers were more likely to test out of English-learner services if they took bilingual classes, a coveted goal because of how well \"former English learners\" do. University of Chicago researchers just released data showing that Chicago high schoolers in this group had higher-than-average GPAs and SAT scores, high school graduation rates, and community college enrollment and persistence rates.\n\nPatricia Gándara co-directs the UCLA Civil Rights Project, which has published similar findings, and has spent decades of her career cataloging the bilingual advantage. She laments the narrow value placed on bilingual education in the U.S., where it has historically been pursued as a way to help kids who don't speak English learn the language more quickly and then succeed in English-only classes.\n\n\"That's a very shortsighted view,\" Gándara said, \"particularly from the research that we've done that shows kids who get a strong bilingual education are more likely to go to college, they're more likely to complete college, they're more likely to have better jobs and better opportunities.\"\n\nYet while policymakers didn't catch on right away, well-off and well-educated white parents did, seeing the economic benefits of bilingualism for their children very clearly.\n\nGlendale Unified School District launched its first Spanish-English dual-language program in 2003, going on to add programs in six other languages while official state policy was to ban them. Last year, 85% of the students enrolled were fluent English speakers, according to program director Nancy Hong.\n\nImmigrant families, weighed down by the pressure to speak English and make sure their children do too, have been hard to recruit. Hong said immigrant parents have long been concerned that letting their children spend half the school day or more hearing their home language will get in the way of learning English, even though research has shown it can make the whole process go faster. \"The goal is to dismantle those myths and misperceptions,\" she said. But even though about 20% of students districtwide are English learners, only about 10% of them are in dual-language programs.\n\nMany immigrant families, however, have become strong advocates for the programs. José Sanjas, a Mexican-born father in Madera Unified School District, takes his 6-year-old daughter past her neighborhood school every day en route to one of the district's dual-language programs. He and his wife want to preserve their native language as their daughter grows up here, but the draw isn't only personal; Sanjas also sees how bilingualism will benefit his daughter in the workplace.\n\n\"She can help more people in the future,\" Sanjas said. \"Professionally, she'll be able to serve everyone.\"\n\nSpurred on by support like his, a diverse coalition of school leaders in Madera Unified had, by 2016, come to see dual-language education as key to turning around the district's chronically low performance, especially among the children of immigrants. Flores had helped make the case, inviting school board members to the annual conference of the California Association for Bilingual Education. And in Flores' hometown, U.S.-born, white families were among those speaking up in support of the programs, knowing even if the immigrant students' test scores had the most room to grow, their children could benefit too.\n\nStatewide, public opinion had swung in the other direction; that November, about 74% of California voters said yes to Proposition 58, officially allowing bilingual education back in California classrooms.\n\n\"It was a relief we [could] finally move forward for our children,\" Flores said. \"We lost a whole generation of kids -- quite a few generations, really -- because of English-only.\"\n\nThe next generation, however, is still waiting.\n\nFlores spent 40 years training future teachers before retiring in 2019. Across three institutions and 32 years at Cal State San Bernardino, she likely taught 10,000 students, many of whom remain sprinkled throughout the state's bilingual-education system. But if anything defines the legacy of Prop. 227, it is the shattered teacher pipeline it left in its wake.\n\nGándara, of the UCLA Civil Rights Project, said the current state of affairs is \"one of those stories of 'I told you so.' ... I could see what the problem was going to be: that when people came back to their senses and realized what a mistake this was, the big fallout was going to be that we didn't have the teachers.\"\n\nCalifornia colleges are not producing nearly enough teachers to meet the state's bilingual-education goals. During the 2022-23 school year, the state commission on teacher credentialing only authorized 1,011 new bilingual teachers -- across all languages. Only seven went to teachers who speak Vietnamese, the second-most-common language in California schools that year. And it actually gave out fewer credentials to Spanish-speaking teachers that year than in the three years prior.\n\nThe Legislature has not ignored this problem entirely. In 2017, it funded six grants, totaling $20 million, to help districts coach up bilingual staffers and prepare them to lead bilingual classrooms. But Edgar Lampkin, CEO of the California Association for Bilingual Education, said seeding such \"grow your own\" programs falls far short of addressing the statewide need. \"That's not systemic,\" he said.\n\nIn 2022, the National Resource Center for Asian Languages, based at Cal State Fullerton, got state money to train 200 teachers over five years. They're on track, and the center's director, Natalie Tran, is proud that their programs are not only increasing the number of teachers certified to teach in Asian languages, but also diversifying the languages they speak. She expects to certify teachers who speak Tagalog, Hmong and Khmer this school year. Still, she said, the state needs to do more to train additional teachers of Asian languages, including the less common ones. \"We're going to need help from policymakers to make this happen,\" Tran said.\n\nShe isn't the only one calling on lawmakers to be part of the solution. Anya Hurwitz is executive director of SEAL, a nonprofit that got its start as an initiative of the Sobrato Family Foundation to address achievement gaps between immigrant and native-born children in Silicon Valley. She says the state underfunds education, which gets in the way of doing what's best for kids who don't speak English.\n\nIn 2022, the last year for which federal census data is available, New York spent almost $30,000 per student. California spent about $17,000. And besides its support for teacher training, the Legislature has only given districts $10 million extra to start or expand dual-language programs. In Massachusetts, home to about one-tenth the number of kids still learning English, the Legislature disbursed $11.8 million for the same work, kicking off its own recovery from an English-only law.\n\n\"Funding is not the solution to everything in and of itself,\" Hurwitz said, \"but at the same time, we can't build capacity without funding and resources.\"\n\nBack in Flores' hometown, Madera administrators have been able to use state and federal money earmarked for their sizable number of immigrant families and those living in poverty to achieve their dual-language goals. But startup costs for dual-language programs are expensive. Teacher preparation programs, Superintendent Todd Lile said, are not producing graduates who are ready to do this work, leaving districts like his with steep professional development costs.\n\nA residency program with Cal State Fresno has given Madera a solid pipeline of teachers, but the recent grads have to clear all the usual hurdles of being new to the profession while also adapting to using Spanish in the classroom. While these new hires at Washington Elementary School grew up bilingual, they went to school through the Prop. 227 years, meaning most of them didn't develop an academic vocabulary in Spanish.\n\nViviana Valerio, a kindergarten teacher, said that history made bilingual education an intimidating proposition. \"I commonly speak Spanish at home, but then when I was thinking about teaching, I was thinking, 'OK, academic terms, I don't know how to translate that,' or 'Parents ask me a question and I can't think of it, I'm going to want to transition into English,'\" she said. \"For me, that was the scary part.\"\n\nTexas, too, lacks bilingual-education teachers, echoing a shortage present in much of the country, but the state is far ahead of California; many districts are able to recruit their own alumni because their programs have been around so long. Texas also continues to invest in bilingual education, helping districts comply with state mandates to offer it. Like California, Texas gives districts more per-pupil funding for every student still learning English; unlike California, Texas offers an additional premium for each of them enrolled in a dual-language program.\n\nAs an extra incentive to start and maintain these programs, Texas has started bumping up funding for the native English speakers enrolled too. Research shows the programs work better when classes are evenly split between native English speakers and speakers of the program's second language. Then, not only are students learning their second language from the teacher but from their peers as well. Conveniently, this also makes for more integrated classrooms, something Gándara said California needs.\n\n\"We haven't been able to take advantage of that, in large part because people don't pay attention to that as a major issue and also because we don't have the teachers to pull it off,\" Gándara said.\n\nIndeed, districts across the state cite staffing as a major barrier to starting or expanding their programs. Some have gone abroad to recruit. Others have been forced to scrap their plans entirely. Newark Unified School District, in the Bay Area, got rid of its dual-language program this year because it couldn't find teachers to staff it. \"We tried everything,\" said Karen Allard, assistant superintendent of education services.\n\nFor more than a decade now, the state's Education Department has tried to champion bilingual programs. Students who can prove their fluency in two languages before graduation get a special seal on their diplomas. The department also implores schools to help the children of immigrants maintain their home language while learning English, building that recommendation into its 2017 English Learner Roadmap. By 2030, it wants half of California students on a path to becoming bilingual.\n\nYet all of this largely amounts to cheerleading. The department is minimally funded and staffed, a result of the state's commitment to sending almost all K-12 funding directly to school districts, and its support for bilingual education has not come with any firm demands.\n\nConor Williams, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank based in Washington, D.C., recently found himself -- a self-described \"professional lefty\" -- in the surprising position of celebrating Texas' policy over California's. Besides following Texas' lead on funding, he said, California should rethink teacher licensing. The state requires college graduates to pass a suite of tests to become teachers, but Williams points out the tests don't lead to better instruction and can keep good teachers from classrooms. Getting rid of the requirement could bring more bilingual adults into the profession and expand the teacher pipeline.\n\nHard to overcome, however, is California's shift toward more local control over schooling. Williams doesn't always agree with what the Texas education department does with its power, but the state's centralized approach means it has \"enough power and muscle and will to set rules and hold districts to them,\" he said. California's Local Control Funding Formula is widely popular and has ensured districts get more state money to serve students still learning English as well as those in foster care and low-income households. But, Williams points out, local control has its limits.\n\n\"You don't win civil rights battles by leaving it up to local school boards,\" he said.\n\nStill, districts like Madera are moving ahead on their own. In 2020, Flores' alma mater, Washington Elementary, became Madera Unified's second dual-language school, welcoming its first class of kindergartners who are expected to leave proficient in both English and Spanish.\n\nMateo Diaz Zanjas was one of them. He's now a fourth-grader and speaks in easy Spanish about the school and his long-term dream of going to Harvard. Upon hearing that he and his peers speak very good Spanish, he eagerly replies: \"We also speak good English.\" And he proves it, going on to answer questions in English about his favorite subjects and the languages he speaks with certain friends.\n\nAdministrators, however, are still waiting for the data to show that their bet on bilingual education will pay off in student achievement gains. The pandemic interrupted their early years and set them back, and the oldest students aren't doing as well as district leaders would have hoped. Commitment to the programs, however, has not waivered. Students' overall test scores remain low, but their growth scores -- or how much they learn over the course of the year -- are high.\n\nThe district is helping students learn English more quickly, too, meaning they are becoming \"former English learners\" faster with the newer supports and joining the district's highest-performing student group.\n\nIn the meantime, Madera teachers are using bilingual education to give Spanish speakers grade-level material, knowing that once they sharpen their English skills, all that information will transfer.\n\n\"Kids can learn math in Spanish; it's still math,\" Lile said. \"They can learn social studies in Spanish; it's still history and geography. These subject matters don't exist only in English.\"\n\nDuring Flores' recent visit to Madera Unified, she heard Lile describe his long-term goals for the district, including higher graduation rates and better college readiness for the children of immigrants. She looked on proudly, sure her hometown district was finally getting it right.\n\nA few years ago, Flores introduced Lile to Margarita Machado-Casas, a professor at San Diego State's Department of Dual Language and English Learner Education, which has long been a top producer of the state's bilingual teachers. Machado-Casas is helping the district figure out what concrete steps teachers and administrators should take to follow the high-level recommendations of the state's English Learner Roadmap. They started out with \"Principle 1,\" which asks school and district staffers to see immigrant students' language and culture as assets rather than seeing their lack of English proficiency as a deficit. Pointing to Madera's long and painful history of discriminating against immigrant students, including Flores, Machado-Casas said this principle unexpectedly took the entire first year, requiring \"courageous conversations\" -- including asking staffers to think deeply about whether they believed in the work enough to stay in the district.\n\nMachado-Casas is helping educators in Madera understand both how to help immigrant students tackle grade-level material and convince them that the students can handle it.\n\nFlores hopes the work ends up being a playbook for the entire state -- which could soon need one. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill this year requiring the Education Department to come up with a statewide plan for helping districts adopt the road map's guidelines and report on their progress.\n\nThis planning process guarantees California will be over a decade into its recovery from the English-only years before the state even considers holding schools accountable for changing their practices. When New York passed a blueprint for how to serve English learners in 2014, it followed it up with new state regulations that same year, creating stricter policies for serving students who were still learning English, including a broader mandate for bilingual education, which had already been required for decades.\n\nAlesha Moreno-Ramirez leads the California Education Department's multilingual support division. She said state budget limitations have gotten in the way of implementing the English Learner Roadmap and said any call to require bilingual education like Texas or New York would have to come from the Legislature, not the department. \"That said, we would enthusiastically support the movement toward requiring bilingual education,\" she added.\n\nAdvocates caution such a mandate would have to come with enough funding to help districts create high-quality programs, but many agree it would be a win for California students. Children from immigrant families speak 108 different languages, according to the Education Department, but 93% of them speak one of 10. To require bilingual programs, the Legislature would likely tweak the current law, which says if the parents of 30 or more students in a single school request a language acquisition program, the school has to offer it \"to the extent possible.\" Texas, Illinois and New York have similar laws, but instead of requiring bilingual programs in response to parent advocacy, they do so based solely on enrollment.\n\nFlores thinks the state is at least moving in the right direction. And Madera Unified gives her hope. During her recent visit, she was flooded with memories: She saw the tree she and her friends used to circle while playing \"Ring Around the Rosie.\" She visited the classroom she walked out of as a 5-year-old, where the walls are now decorated with vocabulary in Spanish as well as English. She suffered in that room 70 years ago. Now, little Mexican girls do not.\n\n\"We don't stop,\" she said. \"We keep plugging away. That's our tenacity. That's our grit. And our motivation, of course, is for our children.\""

        "content": "In 1953, Bárbara Flores entered kindergarten at Washington Elementary School in Madera, California, a small city in the Central Valley surrounded by farm fields. Her mother and grandmother had talked it up: You're going to learn a lot. You're going to like it. She believed them. A little girl who would one day become a teacher, Flores was excited.\n\nBut only until she got there.\n\n\"I walked out,\" Flores recalled recently. She got to her grandmother's house a few blocks away, furious. \"Son mentirosas,\" she said. \"No entiendo nada. Y jamas voy a regresar.\" You're liars. I don't understand anything. And I'm never going back.\n\nFlores only spoke Spanish. As the grandchild of Mexican immigrants, she didn't find her language or culture welcome in the school. But little Bárbara didn't get her way. And, after depositing her daughter back in the classroom, Flores' mother asked the teacher a question: Aren't you paying attention? My daughter walked out. The answer felt like a slap and became a part of family lore. All these little Mexican girls look alike. I didn't notice.\n\nFlores returned to her old school this fall; the building she walked out of still stands, but almost everything else has changed. Now students speak Spanish because their teachers require them to. Little Mexican girls see their culture celebrated on the walls of every classroom.\n\nRelated: Widen your perspective. Our free weekly newsletter consults critical voices on innovation and inequality in K-12 education.\n\nWashington students will graduate knowing how to speak, read and write in both Spanish and English, joining a growing number of \"dual-language immersion\" schools in California. Flores' eyes open wide as she describes the about-face her alma mater has taken.\n\n\"We were punished for speaking Spanish,\" she said. \"We were hit with rulers, pinched, our braids were pulled. Now the whole school is dual-language.\"\n\nThe path has not been linear. When Flores was a child, California still had an English-only law on the books from the 1800s. As governor, Ronald Reagan signed a bill eliminating it. Then the Civil Rights Movement ushered in a new era of bilingual education, and the California Legislature went further, requiring the model for students still learning English from 1976 until the anti-immigrant backlash of the 1990s. Voters banned it again in 1998, only reversing the latest prohibition in 2016.\n\nResearchers have found bilingual education helps students learn English faster and can boost their standardized test scores, increase graduation rates, better prepare them for college and much more. California has removed the official barriers to offering this type of instruction since 2016, and the state now champions bilingualism and biliteracy, encouraging all students to strive for both. But eight years after repeal, California schools have yet to recover. A decades-long enrollment slump in bilingual-teacher prep programs has led to a decimated teacher pipeline. And underinvestment by the Legislature, paired with a hamstrung state Education Department, has limited the pace of bilingual education's comeback.\n\nRelated: A superintendent made big gains with English learners. His success may have been his downfall\n\nThe result? A rare case in which Californians can say Texas is inspiring. Both states enroll more than 1 million students still learning English -- but last year, the Lone Star State put 40% of them in bilingual classrooms. California managed that for just 10%.\n\nIn 1987, Flores didn't think state policy would go this way. At the time, both states required bilingual education. She was a professor, helping build a bilingual-education teacher prep program at Cal State San Bernardino. Her home state could have kept pace with Texas.\n\nBut it didn't.\n\nBy 1998, the bilingual-teacher prep program was flourishing. Flores helped aspiring teachers understand how students learn to read and write in two languages, sending them off into classrooms with binders full of instructional tips. Her daughter, now 10, was learning both English and Spanish through bilingual classes in the San Bernardino City Unified School District. Flores was on a parent committee organizing broader support for such programs in the face of a statewide campaign to get rid of them, bankrolled by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Ron Unz.\n\nProposition 227, which passed with 61% of the vote, required schools to teach only in English for students who were still learning the language, something that may sound like a good idea but ends up unnecessarily putting students' grade-level learning of other subjects on pause while they master English. Flores saw the impact immediately. Faculty on campus called for the elimination of her program, an effort that ultimately failed but showed, she said, \"the intensity of the discrimination and language racism that was prevalent.\" Enrollment in bilingual-teacher prep programs across the state plummeted.\n\nFlores also watched local school districts respond. \"I was shocked at superintendents in the area,\" she said. \"They just made everybody throw away their Spanish books. It was horrendous.\" As she recalls, every single school district in the Inland Empire got rid of its bilingual programs except San Bernardino City Unified, where parent activism helped ensure the district took advantage of an exception to the new law.\n\nAt the time, student achievement data from San Bernardino City Unified had shown that bilingual programs were helping kids succeed. And over the next two decades, researchers studying programs across the United States released a stream of evidence about the benefits of bilingual education, especially a version called \"dual language.\" Traditional bilingual education essentially lets students use their first language while they learn English. Once students become fluent, their schools shift entirely to English instruction, which was the goal all along. Dual-language programs, by contrast, set bilingualism as the goal. Students continue to take courses in Spanish or another language for about half of the school day until they leave the program.\n\nWhile dual-language programs often stop after elementary school, the \"bilingual advantage\" stretches through students' K-12 years and into their working lives. Dual-language students have been found to score higher than their peers on both math and English language arts exams by middle school. They also get higher scores on the ACT in high school, setting them up to be more competitive in college admissions. And importantly, a team at Stanford found that native Spanish speakers were more likely to test out of English-learner services if they took bilingual classes, a coveted goal because of how well \"former English learners\" do. University of Chicago researchers just released data showing that Chicago high schoolers in this group had higher-than-average GPAs and SAT scores, high school graduation rates, and community college enrollment and persistence rates.\n\nRelated: How to keep dual-language programs from being gentrified by English speaking families\n\nPatricia Gándara co-directs the UCLA Civil Rights Project, which has published similar findings, and has spent decades of her career cataloging the bilingual advantage. She laments the narrow value placed on bilingual education in the U.S., where it has historically been pursued as a way to help kids who don't speak English learn the language more quickly and then succeed in English-only classes.\n\n\"That's a very shortsighted view,\" Gándara said, \"particularly from the research that we've done that shows kids who get a strong bilingual education are more likely to go to college, they're more likely to complete college, they're more likely to have better jobs and better opportunities.\"\n\nWhile policymakers didn't catch on right away, well-off and well-educated white parents did, seeing the economic benefits of bilingualism for their children very clearly.\n\nGlendale Unified School District launched its first Spanish-English dual-language program in 2003, going on to add programs in six other languages while official state policy was to ban them. Last year, 85% of the students enrolled were fluent English speakers, according to program director Nancy Hong.\n\nImmigrant families, weighed down by the pressure to speak English and make sure their children do too, have been hard to recruit. Hong said immigrant parents have long been concerned that letting their children spend half the school day or more hearing their home language will get in the way of learning English, even though research has shown it can make the whole process go faster. \"The goal is to dismantle those myths and misperceptions,\" she said. But even though about 20% of students districtwide are English learners, only about 10% of them are in dual-language programs.\n\nMany immigrant families, however, have become strong advocates for the programs. José Sanjas, a Mexican-born father in Madera Unified School District, takes his 6-year-old daughter past her neighborhood school every day en route to one of the district's dual-language programs. He and his wife want to preserve their native language as their daughter grows up here, but the draw isn't only personal; Sanjas also sees how bilingualism will benefit his daughter in the workplace.\n\n\"She can help more people in the future,\" Sanjas said. \"Professionally, she'll be able to serve everyone.\"\n\nSpurred by support like his, a diverse coalition of school leaders in Madera Unified had, by 2016, come to see dual-language education as key to turning around the district's chronically low performance, especially among the children of immigrants. Flores had helped make the case, inviting school board members to the annual conference of the California Association for Bilingual Education. And in Flores' hometown, white, U.S.-born families were among those speaking up in support of the programs, knowing even if the immigrant students' test scores had the most room to grow, their children could benefit too.\n\nRelated: English learners stopped coming to class during the pandemic. One group is tackling the problem by helping their parents\n\nStatewide, public opinion had swung in the other direction; that November, about 74% of California voters said yes to Proposition 58, officially allowing bilingual education back in California classrooms.\n\n\"It was a relief we [could] finally move forward for our children,\" Flores said. \"We lost a whole generation of kids -- quite a few generations, really -- because of English-only.\"\n\nThe next generation, however, is still waiting.\n\nFlores spent 40 years training future teachers before retiring in 2019. Across three institutions and 32 years at Cal State San Bernardino, she likely taught 10,000 students, many of whom remain sprinkled throughout the state's bilingual-education system. But if anything defines the legacy of Prop. 227, it is the shattered teacher pipeline it left in its wake.\n\nGándara, of the UCLA Civil Rights Project, said the current state of affairs is \"one of those stories of 'I told you so.' ... I could see what the problem was going to be: that when people came back to their senses and realized what a mistake this was, the big fallout was going to be that we didn't have the teachers.\"\n\nCalifornia colleges are not producing nearly enough teachers to meet the state's bilingual-education goals. During the 2022-23 school year, the state commission on teacher credentialing only authorized 1,011 new bilingual teachers -- across all languages. Only seven went to teachers who speak Vietnamese, the second-most-common language in California schools that year. And it actually gave out fewer credentials to Spanish-speaking teachers that year than in the three years prior.\n\nThe Legislature has not ignored this problem entirely. In 2017, it funded six grants, totaling $20 million, to help districts coach up bilingual staffers and prepare them to lead bilingual classrooms. But Edgar Lampkin, CEO of the California Association for Bilingual Education, said seeding such \"grow your own\" programs falls far short of addressing the statewide need. \"That's not systemic,\" he said.\n\nIn 2022, the National Resource Center for Asian Languages, based at Cal State Fullerton, got state money to train 200 teachers over five years. They're on track, and the center's director, Natalie Tran, is proud that their programs are not only increasing the number of teachers certified to teach in Asian languages, but also diversifying the languages they speak. She expects to certify teachers who speak Tagalog, Hmong and Khmer this school year. Still, she said, the state needs to do more to train more teachers of Asian languages, including the less common ones. \"We're going to need help from policymakers to make this happen,\" Tran said.\n\nShe isn't the only one calling on lawmakers to be part of the solution. Anya Hurwitz is executive director of SEAL, a nonprofit that got its start as an initiative of the Sobrato Family Foundation to address achievement gaps between immigrant and native-born children in Silicon Valley. She says the state underfunds education, which gets in the way of doing what's best for kids who don't speak English.\n\nRelated: ¿Planeas ir a la universidad? Nuestras herramientas te pueden ayudar a elegir una escuela y planificar los costos\n\nIn 2022, the last year for which federal census data is available, New York spent almost $30,000 per student. California spent about $17,000. And besides its support for teacher training, the Legislature has only given districts $10 million extra to start or expand dual-language programs. In Massachusetts, home to about one-tenth the number of kids still learning English, the Legislature disbursed $11.8 million for the same work, kicking off its own recovery from an English-only law.\n\n\"Funding is not the solution to everything in and of itself,\" Hurwitz said, \"but at the same time, we can't build capacity without funding and resources.\"\n\nBack in Flores' hometown, Madera administrators have been able to use state and federal money earmarked for their sizable number of immigrant families and those living in poverty to achieve their dual-language goals.

        "content": "\"Dharma, consciousness, and art embody the divine essence within oneself- a power that governs the world.\" Dr. Sachchidanand Joshi\n\nNew Delhi: Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, in collaboration with the 'Rays of Wisdom Society' and supported by the Ministry of Culture, Government of India, held the 8 International Ancient Arts Festival and Symposium from 8 to 10 November,2024 at IGNCA. This event featured an exhibition titled 'Metaphysical, Symbolic, and Healing Themes in Visual Arts', alongside a conference on 'Art, Religion, and Healing'. As part of the cultural program, Dr. Reela Hota presented 'Antar Yatra', a dance performance exploring the journey of consciousness through yogic philosophy. On the second day, Shri Shrinivas Joshi delivered a vocal recital, and the final day concluded with a Kuchipudi dance performance by Smt. Yamini Reddy and her group. The eminent guests present during the course of the event included Amita Sarabhai, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Culture; Shri V. Srinivas (IAS), Secretary, Government of India, Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG); Dr. Sachchidanand Joshi, Member Secretary, IGNCA; Dr. Reela Hota, Odissi Danseuse and Founder, Rays of Wisdom Society; Dr. Manindra Thakur, Co-convener of the conference; and Prof. Richa Kamboj, Head of Kaladarsana, IGNCA.\n\nThe 'International Ancient Arts Conference', organized by the Rays of Wisdom Society in collaboration with the Religion, Consciousness, and Spirituality Group (nurtured by the Foundation for Creative Social Research), gathered esteemed scholars to examine the healing potential of ancient art forms. With lectures and discussions focused on 'Religion, Consciousness and Spirituality and its Manifestation for Personal and Social Healing', the conference aimed to reveal how timeless principles of spirituality are expressed through art. The conference included insightful discussions on topics such as 'Art and Conflict Resolution', 'Healing in Baul Philosophy', 'Odissi and its Universal Principles', 'Drama Movement and Therapeutics', and 'The Aesthetics of Beauty'. Scholars also explored 'Dealing with Unfulfilled Desires through Malay Traditional Psychotherapy', 'Devotional Music and Spirituality', 'Kundalini in Poetry', 'Spirituality in Indian Fine Arts', and 'The Elements of Spirituality in Manipuri Music'. The impact of religious rituals as socio-cultural art forms, the metaphysics of temple architecture, and the epistemology of children's theatre were also significant focal points. Dr. Madhu Khanna, Professor of Indic Religion and Tagore National Fellow at the National Museum in New Delhi, delivered the keynote speech. The special guest of honour at the inaugural session of the conference was Dr. Sachchidanand Joshi.\n\nAt the inaugural session, Dr. Sachchidanand Joshi spoke on the essence of religion in the 'Sanatan' context, explaining that 'dharma' encompasses how one leads their life. He emphasized that 'kutumb' extends beyond the immediate family to include one's environment, mind, and ecology, making the explanation of 'dharma' clear and encompassing. He remarked that while the term 'religion' holds one meaning, 'dharma' represents a distinct understanding. He expressed hope that the conference's deliberations would delve into how we interpret 'dharma' for the self. Dr. Joshi also spoke on consciousness, highlighting its unique connotations in Indian philosophy. He noted that while we recognize a single consciousness that governs the world, this consciousness is also present within each individual and manifests within the self. This self is expressed in varied forms, embodying the concept that truth is singular yet expressed in multiple ways. Regarding art, he noted that its expression lies in truth and, for us, transcends mere entertainment or infotainment. Art is not for personal gratification; rather, it is a medium to internalize the essence of the divine power within oneself -- a power that simultaneously governs the world.\n\nIn her keynote address, Dr. Madhu Khanna stated that epics like the 'Ramayana' and 'Mahabharata' connect us to art. Literary texts, she explained, help us visualize and thus unify us with the arts. The 'Ramayana' serves as a prime example of the interrelationship among all art forms, with no other epic playing as significant an assimilative role as those in India. While different literary texts represent various cultural traditions, they maintain continuity even amid subversion and defiance. She emphasized, \"Art is the quest for true self.\"She further explained that 'Rasa', or aesthetic delight, cannot exist without 'Bhava', the emotional response; similarly, artistic emotion is inseparable from aesthetic delight.\n\nIn this context Amita Sarabhai, Joint Secretary at the Ministry of Culture, affirms the Ministry's dedication to preserving and promoting cultural heritage, added, \"This festival embodies our commitment to enriching cultural awareness, especially among younger generations.\" Prof. (Dr) Richa Kamboj, remarked, \"The rich cultural heritage of Bharat carries the essence of spirituality that breathes life into its arts. Ancient Indian art embodies 'spiritual contemplation' as a path to divinity.\"\n\nDr. Reela Hota and her ensemble 'Antar Yatra' was presented on the first day of the festival. A unique dance piece rooted in yogic philosophy that explored the concept of chakras and personal transformation. This dance drama incorporated Odissi, Chhau, and contemporary ballet to symbolize the ascension of consciousness from the base (Mooladhara) to the crown (Sahasrara) chakra. 'Antar Yatra' culminated in the depiction of 'Moksha', the ultimate state of bliss and unity with universal consciousness.\n\nOther distinguished speakers included Guru Ramli Ibrahim, Chairman of the Sutra Foundation in Malaysia; Prof. Swati Pal of Janki Devi College, University of Delhi; Dr. Shashi Bala, Dean at the K M Munshi Centre of Indology; Dr. Uma Rele, Principal of Nalanda Nritya Kala Mahavidyalaya; Prof. Ashish Ghosh, retired theatre activist and professor at Dayal Singh College; and Prof. Arvind Sharma, Birks Professor of Religion at McGill University, Canada. This conference provided a platform for enriching discussions on the intersection of spirituality, art, and healing, highlighting art's profound role in personal and social transformation. The 8 International Ancient Arts Festival and Symposium highlighted the therapeutic essence of ancient arts, uniting diverse cultural expressions to emphasize their impact on mental and spiritual well-being. The three-day event celebrated the timeless connection between art and holistic health."

It was the start of a recorded sermon, played over the speakers, from a church in Jeffersonville, Indiana, six decades before. In 1963, children cried and grown-ups coughed as the sermon began. In Phoenix, the words of the 60-year-old sermon began scrolling across two mounted video monitors, one showing Spanish, the other English. The speaker was William Branham, an American preacher considered God's prophet in Jericho Tabernacle and by millions of people around the world. Those followers have included a series of men who used Branham's teachings to form destructive cults. The back wall of the tabernacle's pulpit featured a portrait of Jesus Christ on one side and a photo of Branham on the other. They were the same size. As Branham's voice occasionally rose to peaks in the tinny recording, present-day attendees in Phoenix murmured \"Amen\" and raised their hands toward the ceiling.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nCrossroads Mall to be demolished, area to be redeveloped under $20 million city agreement Employee steals $10,000 in merchandise from Cedar Falls' Walmart UPDATE: Waterloo Community Schools' buildings taken off of lockdown Jesup woman claims $10,000 in Iowa Lottery scratch game Unsettled: Residents unsure about Cedar Falls mobile home park's future UPDATE: Jury finds business owner guilty of setting fire to her Waukon store Recipients of The Courier's 20 Under 40 Awards honored at Cedar Falls reception Jerry Mark's latest appeal: Slayings of brother, family were drug cartel hit Waterloo police chief says 'multiple people' identified for distributing neo-Nazi flyers Iowa State vs Utah football kick time, TV channel revealed For Grace, Northern Iowa knocks off No. 8 Iowa State for first Top Ten win Former Waterloo man charged with son's spinal injury Trelka resigns from Black Hawk County board, sworn in as Colorado police chief Biden should resign and make Kamala Harris America's first female president\n\nThe sect known as \"The Message,\" or \"The Message of the Hour,\" continues to grow in countries as far apart as India, El Salvador and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, thanks in part to this unique feature of Branham's ministry. Long before the advent of televangelists, Branham had all of his sermons recorded. From 1947 until his death in December 1965, more than 1,200 were recorded, many of them up to two hours long. The recordings, along with written translations of Branham's words, allow The Message to continue spreading, even now, almost six decades after his death. For many followers, that simply means following a strict, rule-bound faith focused on preparing for the approaching End Times. But the unaccountable, independent structure of Message churches has often lent itself to the growth of destructive groups dominated by powerful central figures, an Arizona Daily Star and Lee Enterprises Public Service Journalism Team investigation found. The year-long investigation is the first news-media account of The Message and its global influence. Leaders influenced by Branham have overseen a deadly starvation cult in Kenya in 2023, a colony in Chile that murdered and tortured prisoners and abused children in the 1970s, a trailer-park commune in Arizona that abused children in the 1960s and other high-control groups that have been accused of psychological manipulation and sexual crimes. Message leaders say those atrocities do not represent their religious movement or their prophet. \"Brother Branham never stood for those kinds of things,\" said Jeremy Evans, spokesperson for Voice of God Recordings, which distributes Branham's sermons worldwide. \"I think it's a shame some of the things that have happened that falsely represent The Message of the Hour.\" Branham's son and VGR president Joseph Branham said it is a \"disgrace, and truly a stain on Christianity\" when people misuse his father's message or \"twist\" biblical teachings to form a cult. Joseph Branham declined an interview but answered questions via email. \"We do not stand for that,\" Joseph Branham said. \"We are firmly against using the Holy Bible to empower an individual or group ... to dominate a congregation.\" But former Message believer and now researcher Rod Bergen said the lack of governing structure over Message churches allows pastors to take authoritarian control over their congregations. \"The problem is the way that William Branham said that churches should be run makes things ready-made for abuse. He basically said the pastor and the pastor only should call the shots,\" Bergen said. \"There's no accountability. If you have no accountability, you're gonna get abuse.\"\n\n'Fringe' Christian sect\n\nDuring the height of his fame in the 1950s, Branham stood alongside Oral Roberts as one of the \"two giants\" of the post-World War II healing revival, according to historian David Harrell Jr. Thousands were drawn to Pentecostal tent meetings to see Branham or Roberts perform faith healings. But today, Roberts has a university named after him, and Branham is largely unknown in mainstream American culture.\n\nFrom backwoods boy to 20th century 'prophet': How William Branham gained a global following\n\nAlthough William Branham died in 1965, millions of people worldwide still follow his teachings. The sect has expanded, in part, through more than 1,200 recordings of his sermons.\n\nThat hasn't kept The Message from growing -- in large part due to Voice of God Recordings' efforts to translate and distribute Branham's sermons in written booklets, cassette tapes, CDs, mp3 players and now computer tablets worldwide. Over the last 40 years, the sect has grown tenfold from an estimated 300,000 followers in 1986 to an estimated 3 million today, according to Voice of God Recordings distribution figures. The estimates are based on how many people get VGR's materials, but the nonprofit doesn't verify whether those people have accepted The Message, Evans said. Africa has the most Message churches of any continent, Evans said. About 1,500 churches in Kenya alone claim to follow The Message, he added. The Message also has a sizeable following in Latin America due not only to Voice of God but also other missionaries. Phoenix resident Jorge Hernandez Jr. worked for decades helping his father establish Message churches in Mexico, his native El Salvador, Peru and other countries, he said. An incomplete list shows nearly 600 Message churches in more than 70 countries and on every continent except Antarctica, according to a Message church directory maintained by Living Word Broadcast. Lee Enterprises Public Service Journalism Team identified more than 50 YouTube pages in 25 countries dedicated to playing Branham sermons and disseminating The Message. Together, the YouTube channels had nearly 1 million subscribers and 200 million views as of July. One Brazilian Message YouTube channel had more than 90 million views and 400,000 subscribers.\n\nDouglas Weaver, chair of the Department of Religion at Baylor University, noted Voice of God Recordings' figures could be exaggerated. The Message is small compared to global religions like the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. It is \"on the fringe\" of Christianity, he said.\n\nMany former Message followers call the sect a \"cult.\" They say they've experienced brainwashing and other manipulation tactics in Message churches. Some say they have experienced sexual and physical abuse. But that experience is not universal. Many adore their prophet, whom they affectionately and reverently refer to as \"Brother Branham.\" Their faces light up with joy when they describe how Branham healed their family members decades ago. Some have gone to the point of deifying him; a small group shows up at his grave every Easter to see if he'll rise from the dead. But others have a more reserved view. \"There are people who have thought of him as more than just an ordinary man. I don't,\" said Ohio Message believer Margaret Ball, 80. \"But I just know he was a man who was chosen by God to deliver a message. I was fortunate to hear that message.\" Ball has attended Literal Life church in Michigan for about 20 years and has been part of The Message for 40.\n\nSome Message congregations listen to Branham's recorded sermons at each service, eliminating the need for a pastor. Most others -- including Jericho Tabernacle, which only sometimes listens to tapes -- have lead pastors who deliver sermons based on the Bible and Branham's interpretations of Scripture. In a typical service, congregants pray for the sick, greet their neighbors, sing gospel songs and receive a message. Joseph Branham said his father \"never wanted to start a cult or a following. He condemned such things.\" \"We're not a cult. We're not a bunch of fanatics,\" William Branham said in 1965. As a historian, Weaver said he doesn't use the word \"cult\" because it's \"always a derogatory term,\" but he wouldn't question those who said they had a cultish experience in The Message. \"I simply chose not to use it because I did not feel like the people were brainwashed,\" Weaver said. \"And I have never met Message people that were dangerous. They were hardworking Americans who had a religion that I absolutely didn't follow.\" John Collins, a former Message believer who now runs an anti-Branham research website, said it's the wrong question to ask whether or not something is a cult. The more important question, he said, is whether it's destructive. He said some Message churches are \"somewhat benign,\" but others \"are very, very controlling and very manipulative.\"\n\nThird-largest cult killing\n\nAlthough many Branham groups are led by benign pastors, a few leaders have become extreme. That's what happened in Malindi, Kenya last year when doomsday cult leader Paul Mackenzie allegedly led his followers into the Shakahola forest and told them to starve themselves to death to meet Jesus,\n\naccording to the Associated Press\n\n. Experts say Mackenzie was influenced by Branham. More than 400 of Mackenzie's followers died, making it the\n\nthird-largest cult killing in modern history\n\n. Authorities\n\ndiscovered the bodies in shallow graves over months of investigation starting in April 2023\n\n, Reuters reported.\n\nMackenzie and 29 cult members were formally charged in February with the torture and murder of 191 children found among the dead. They denied responsibility for the deaths. Rick Ross, executive director and founder of the Cult Education Institute, said Mackenzie was influenced by the teachings of Branham and David McKay, founder of a group called the Jesus Christians. Ross said there are certain doctrines Mackenzie taught that are \"signature Branham.\"\n\nDetectives told local newspaper People Daily Kenya that \"Mackenzie brainwashed his converts using William Branham's End of Days Theology.\" Investigators found Voice of God Recordings booklets containing Branham sermons inside abandoned homes near the mass graves. Like Branham, Mackenzie was \"obsessed with the end of the world,\" Ross said. They both told their followers to prepare for an apocalypse that could come any day -- a doctrine that makes followers easy to manipulate, Ross said. \"The reason that the people starved to death was they were fasting and praying in preparation for the end,\" Ross said. Branham preached that there's \"nothing\" in the Bible that justifies fasting to the point of starvation, supporters point out. \"Usually in a fast, I never feel hungry. If you feel hungry, it's time to eat,\" Branham said in 1953.\n\nEvans said Voice of God Recordings \"has never had any contact or association\" with Mackenzie. The recent tragedy \"is the farthest thing from The Message that you can get,\" he said. \"To associate this Kenya pastor with The Message because he had a few of Rev. Branham's sermons in his church library is absurd,\" Evans said. \"It would be like blaming Billy Graham, Joel Osteen or Kenneth Copeland for his actions because he had their books in the church library.\" Ross said it's unsurprising that Voice of God Recordings would want to distance themselves from Mackenzie. \"Of course, nobody wants to say, 'Oh yeah, Paul Mackenzie. Yeah, I'm aware of him, and he believes some of what we teach, and he's been influenced by some of what we put out there,'\" Ross said. \"Nobody wants to admit that given that he's now considered ... the third-most destructive cult leader in modern history.\"\n\nJim Jones connection\n\nBranham also played a role in popularizing the ministry of the most deadly cult leader in modern history, the Rev. Jim Jones, according to a book on Jones' life written by journalist Tim Reiterman, who covered Jones' cult for the San Francisco Examiner.\n\nJones led hundreds to their deaths in 1978 in what is now known as the Jonestown massacre. Backed by guards armed with guns and crossbows, Jones ordered his followers at an isolated compound in Guyana to kill themselves by drinking cyanide-laced punch, according to Reiterman's book \"Raven: The Untold Story of the Rev. Jim Jones and His People.\" Those who resisted were murdered with forced injections of poison. Children and babies were force-fed the poison punch with syringes. More than 900 people died, including 300 children. Jones died from a gunshot wound to the head, possibly self-inflicted. About 20 years before the massacre, Jones only had about 100 followers and was looking for ways to expand his ministry, Reiterman wrote. Jones enlisted Branham -- at the height of his fame as a faith healer -- to headline a Pentecostal religious convention from June 11 to June 15, 1956, in Indianapolis. The event drew more than 10,000 people, Reiterman reported.\n\nGlossary: Common words and phrases at Message churches\n\nThe Bride. End Times. Serpent's seed. These are some of the words and phrases you'll hear if you attend a Message church.\n\nBoth Jones and Branham used people's addresses, Social Security, phone and insurance policy numbers to tell people about their pasts and futures like \"fortune tellers,\" Reiterman wrote. The two preachers would then lay their hands on people in prayer and give them a good shove on the forehead with the healing power of the Holy Spirit. Those \"healed\" by Jones and Branham would fall to the floor twitching as the crowd cried out in praise, Reiterman said. The publicity Jones received at the convention was \"invaluable\" to the growth of his ministry, Reiterman wrote. Collins said he confirmed at least two more events where Jones and Branham preached alongside each other. He credits Branham with helping launch Jones' career during the Indianapolis convention. \"Not long after that Jones began hosting and sponsoring William Branham's revival meetings in multiple states,\" Collins said. Joseph Branham said it's \"ludicrous\" to try to tie his father to Jim Jones. \"There is of course nothing William Branham ever taught that would support such an evil crime as Jim Jones made,\" he said.\n\nDoomsday colony\n\nCollins wrote that Jonestown bears \"striking similarities\" to a Branham-influenced colony in Chile: Colonia Dignidad. \"Both communes initially started as 'agricultural communities.' Both were led by a narcissistic authoritarian figure. Both communes regulated -- and deprived members of -- sleep, sex and more. Both resulted in horrific deaths of members,\" Collins wrote in his book, \"Weaponized Religion: From Latter Rain to Colonia Dignidad.\"\n\nThe Chilean colony started in 1955 in post-war West Germany when a preacher named Paul Schafer showed up to see Branham preach in Karlsruhe, said Carlos Basso, a Chilean journalist and author of a book on the religious sect Schafer founded, called La Secta Perfecta. Basso said Schafer offered himself and a collection of followers to provide security for the rest of the tour. Branham accepted. Schafer had already established an orphanage and a small religious colony of fundamentalist Christians in West Germany. After seeing Branham, he adopted more of the American preacher's doctrine and style, Basso said. \"Before Schafer got acquainted with Branham, he never said anything about the end of the world,\" Basso said. \"After that, he became convinced the world was going to stop spinning one day.\" Joseph Branham said even if these alleged connections are true, they're thin at best, and Schafer's group is in no way reflective of William Branham's ministry.\n\nIn those early years of the colony, Schafer was already being accused of molesting boys, and when he was charged by German authorities, he took off, Basso said. Finally, in 1961 he ended up in southern Chile and re-established his colony there. He called it Colonia Dignidad. Schafer retained some similarities to Branham's sect while creating his own little German world in the south of South America. As in many Branham churches and sects, the leader, Schafer, was considered a prophet who could communicate with God, referred to by residents as their \"permanent uncle.\" The community he established treated the outside world as a demonic place to be feared, Basso said. But the control was not just psychological: Fences surrounded the property, and Schafer used sensors and cameras to monitor the boundaries, Basso said. Those who escaped were tracked down ruthlessly and even tortured.\n\nAs the years passed, Schafer continued molesting boys, but eventually there were too few German boys of the age he preferred, 8 to 12, Basso said. That's when the colony began recruiting local families to supply their children through various ruses. \"He started to bribe the judges of the towns near Colonia to get boys from poor people adopted by him or by his friends,\" Basso said. \"Chilean boys -- very, very poor boys -- became the next victims of Schafer.\" Communism loomed as the most tangible expression of evil in Schafer's worldview, as researcher Bruce Falconer wrote in a detailed account of Colonia Dignidad published in 2008 in The American Scholar. When military leaders overthrew socialist president Salvador Allende in 1973, Schafer offered the colony as a detention, torture and killing camp, Falconer explained. As early as 1977, Amnesty International accused Colonia Dignidad of being a torture center for the military government. Killings probably took place there as well, maybe many of them, but Chilean investigators have scoured the property and been unable to clarify the full scope of the deaths there, Falconer and Basso reported.\n\nThat relationship with the dictatorship bought Schafer protection from his crimes for many years. It wasn't until 1996 that a Chilean judge issued a warrant for his arrest, on charges of child molestation, and later on charges of aiding in the disappearance of a left-wing activist. In 2006, Schafer was convicted of molesting 25 children and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He died in prison in 2010.\n\nTrailer park commune\n\nShortly before Branham died in 1965, he visited an Arizona trailer park nestled in the woods along a quiet stream. He compared the Message commune, called \"The Park,\" to the Promised Land.\n\n\"To come here this morning and look, this fine little Jerusalem setting out here, little ... Goshen,\" Branham preached before the community in Prescott in 1964. \"I can see why you people would want to stay here.\" The commune's leader, Leo Mercier, was one of the \"tape boys\" who recorded Branham's sermons. Branham said he always knew Mercier was made for \"something greater in life.\" Mercier used Branham's blessing to paint himself as a sort of \"king\" or \"demi-prophet\" over the commune members, said Deborah Thibodeau, who grew up in the commune. Thibodeau and about 100 other children were routinely beaten at the commune on Mercier's orders until The Park dissolved in 1975, according to Thibodeau, another former member and court records. There's also evidence that Mercier molested children, according to the California Supreme Court.\n\nLeaders revered\n\nAcross the U.S., men have used Branham's framework to seize power and create cultish communities, former members and experts say. In Camp Verde, Arizona in 1992, Ross said he helped a young mother get her daughter out of a Branham cult called the Spoken Word Tabernacle.\n\nAuthorities feared the pastor was planning a mass killing\n\nof his followers on Christmas of that year -- the date he predicted the world would end, according to The Associated Press. The pastor, also named Jim Jones, was\n\nsentenced to 28 years in prison for child molestation\n\nin a 1998 trial in Arizona, the Verde Independent reported. He was accused of sexually abusing two girls in his church. Jones\n\ndied in prison\n\na couple of years after he was convicted. A Lee Enterprises and Arizona Daily Star investigation also found:\n\nA Tucson Message church where the pastor uses threats of hell and shunning to exert control over congregants' finances, health decisions and personal lives. Twenty former members said the church, Golden Dawn Tabernacle, has devolved into a \"cult.\" An Arkansas Message church where \"everyone reveres the leader almost as if he's God,\" former member Sarah Kiser said. She now calls the group a \"cult.\" Members cannot have TVs, listen to secular music or have friends outside church. Women must follow a strict dress code and cannot move out of their parents' homes until they marry. A polygamous Message group active from the early '80s to 2007 in western New York, central Ohio and Arkansas. The group believed their leader was the \"prophet\" or \"voice box of God\" who was preparing the world for \"Jesus's third and final coming,\" former member Naomi Wright said. She described the group as a \"cult.\"\n\nNo accountability\n\nBergen,\n\nwho now runs an anti-Branham research website\n\n, said coverups are common in The Message. It's not just that there's no governing board to hold people accountable, Bergen said. When congregants believe they are part of the chosen \"Bride of Christ\" who will survive the rapture, they're motivated to sweep misconduct under the rug, he said. \"This stuff doesn't happen in a perfect church,\" Bergen said. \"So what do you have to do? You just gotta cover it up.\"\n\nFormer Message member Milton Rosa said he witnessed a lack of accountability at his church in Brazil. Four women accused Brazilian Message pastor Joaquim Gonçalves Silva of sexual abuse dating back to 2002, according to Metrópoles, a Brazilian news website. Silva denied the allegations. He died later in 2021 before he could be tried in court. Rosa said church leaders were aware of other sexual abuse allegations against Silva years before. \"It came to light. People did nothing about it. And he continued doing it,\" Rosa said. \"People turned a blind eye to it.\" The pattern, Rosa said, is that of powerful spiritual leaders like Silva using their influence and position to manipulate vulnerable people. It happened in Brazil, Kenya, Chile and Arizona and will continue across the globe, he said. \"We hear the story of the trailer park,\" Rosa said. \"That story is not only there. If you dig deep, you see that that story repeats, and it repeats over and over.\"\n\nAbout this series\n\nLee Enterprises investigative team and the Arizona Daily Star interviewed more than 50 former and current Message followers, experts and religious leaders for \"Twisted Message.\" The series examines the lack of accountability in a Christian religious sect called \"The Message.\" Some groups that claim to follow the faith have become controlling or destructive, including a Tucson church accused of being a \"cult,\" an Arizona trailer park commune that physically and sexually abused children in the 1960s and churches across the U.S. that allegedly treat women as \"second-class citizens.\" The year-long investigation is the first news-media account of The Message and its global influence.

But the unaccountable, independent structure of Message churches has often lent itself to the growth of destructive groups dominated by powerful central figures, an Arizona Daily Star and Lee Enterprises Public Service Journalism Team investigation found.\n\nThe year-long investigation is the first news-media account of The Message and its global influence.\n\nLeaders influenced by Branham have overseen a deadly starvation cult in Kenya in 2023, a colony in Chile that murdered and tortured prisoners and abused children in the 1970s, a trailer-park commune in Arizona that abused children in the 1960s and other high-control groups that have been accused of psychological manipulation and sexual crimes.\n\nMessage leaders say those atrocities do not represent their religious movement or their prophet.\n\n\"Brother Branham never stood for those kinds of things,\" said Jeremy Evans, spokesperson for Voice of God Recordings, which distributes Branham's sermons worldwide. \"I think it's a shame some of the things that have happened that falsely represent The Message of the Hour.\"\n\nBranham's son and VGR president Joseph Branham said it is a \"disgrace, and truly a stain on Christianity\" when people misuse his father's message or \"twist\" biblical teachings to form a cult. Joseph Branham declined an interview but answered questions via email.\n\n\"We do not stand for that,\" Joseph Branham said. \"We are firmly against using the Holy Bible to empower an individual or group ... to dominate a congregation.\"\n\nBut former Message believer and now researcher Rod Bergen said the lack of governing structure over Message churches allows pastors to take authoritarian control over their congregations.\n\n\"The problem is the way that William Branham said that churches should be run makes things ready-made for abuse. He basically said the pastor and the pastor only should call the shots,\" Bergen said. \"There's no accountability. If you have no accountability, you're gonna get abuse.\"\n\n'Fringe' Christian sect\n\nDuring the height of his fame in the 1950s, Branham stood alongside Oral Roberts as one of the \"two giants\" of the post-World War II healing revival, according to historian David Harrell Jr. Thousands were drawn to Pentecostal tent meetings to see Branham or Roberts perform faith healings. But today, Roberts has a university named after him, and Branham is largely unknown in mainstream American culture.\n\nFrom backwoods boy to 20th century 'prophet': How William Branham gained a global following\n\nAlthough William Branham died in 1965, millions of people worldwide still follow his teachings. The sect has expanded, in part, through more than 1,200 recordings of his sermons.\n\nThat hasn't kept The Message from growing -- in large part due to Voice of God Recordings' efforts to translate and distribute Branham's sermons in written booklets, cassette tapes, CDs, mp3 players and now computer tablets worldwide.\n\nOver the last 40 years, the sect has grown tenfold from an estimated 300,000 followers in 1986 to an estimated 3 million today, according to Voice of God Recordings distribution figures. The estimates are based on how many people get VGR's materials, but the nonprofit doesn't verify whether those people have accepted The Message, Evans said.\n\nAfrica has the most Message churches of any continent, Evans said. About 1,500 churches in Kenya alone claim to follow The Message, he added.\n\nThe Message also has a sizeable following in Latin America due not only to Voice of God but also other missionaries. Phoenix resident Jorge Hernandez Jr. worked for decades helping his father establish Message churches in Mexico, his native El Salvador, Peru and other countries, he said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAn incomplete list shows nearly 600 Message churches in more than 70 countries and on every continent except Antarctica, according to a Message church directory maintained by Living Word Broadcast.\n\nLee Enterprises Public Service Journalism Team identified more than 50 YouTube pages in 25 countries dedicated to playing Branham sermons and disseminating The Message. Together, the YouTube channels had nearly 1 million subscribers and 200 million views as of July. One Brazilian Message YouTube channel had more than 90 million views and 400,000 subscribers.\n\nDouglas Weaver, chair of the Department of Religion at Baylor University, noted Voice of God Recordings' figures could be exaggerated. The Message is small compared to global religions like the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. It is \"on the fringe\" of Christianity, he said.\n\nMany former Message followers call the sect a \"cult.\" They say they've experienced brainwashing and other manipulation tactics in Message churches. Some say they have experienced sexual and physical abuse.\n\nBut that experience is not universal. Many adore their prophet, whom they affectionately and reverently refer to as \"Brother Branham.\" Their faces light up with joy when they describe how Branham healed their family members decades ago. Some have gone to the point of deifying him; a small group shows up at his grave every Easter to see if he'll rise from the dead. But others have a more reserved view.\n\n\"There are people who have thought of him as more than just an ordinary man. I don't,\" said Ohio Message believer Margaret Ball, 80. \"But I just know he was a man who was chosen by God to deliver a message. I was fortunate to hear that message.\"\n\nBall has attended Literal Life church in Michigan for about 20 years and has been part of The Message for 40.\n\nSome Message congregations listen to Branham's recorded sermons at each service, eliminating the need for a pastor. Most others -- including Jericho Tabernacle, which only sometimes listens to tapes -- have lead pastors who deliver sermons based on the Bible and Branham's interpretations of Scripture. In a typical service, congregants pray for the sick, greet their neighbors, sing gospel songs and receive a message.\n\nJoseph Branham said his father \"never wanted to start a cult or a following. He condemned such things.\"\n\n\"We're not a cult. We're not a bunch of fanatics,\" William Branham said in 1965.\n\nAs a historian, Weaver said he doesn't use the word \"cult\" because it's \"always a derogatory term,\" but he wouldn't question those who said they had a cultish experience in The Message.\n\n\"I simply chose not to use it because I did not feel like the people were brainwashed,\" Weaver said. \"And I have never met Message people that were dangerous. They were hardworking Americans who had a religion that I absolutely didn't follow.\"\n\nJohn Collins, a former Message believer who now runs an anti-Branham research website, said it's the wrong question to ask whether or not something is a cult. The more important question, he said, is whether it's destructive. He said some Message churches are \"somewhat benign,\" but others \"are very, very controlling and very manipulative.\"\n\nThird-largest cult killing\n\nAlthough many Branham groups are led by benign pastors, a few leaders have become extreme.\n\nThat's what happened in Malindi, Kenya last year when doomsday cult leader Paul Mackenzie allegedly led his followers into the Shakahola forest and told them to starve themselves to death to meet Jesus, according to the Associated Press. Experts say Mackenzie was influenced by Branham.\n\nMore than 400 of Mackenzie's followers died, making it the third-largest cult killing in modern history.\n\nAuthorities discovered the bodies in shallow graves over months of investigation starting in April 2023, Reuters reported.\n\nMackenzie and 29 cult members were formally charged in February with the torture and murder of 191 children found among the dead. They denied responsibility for the deaths.\n\nRick Ross, executive director and founder of the Cult Education Institute, said Mackenzie was influenced by the teachings of Branham and David McKay, founder of a group called the Jesus Christians. Ross said there are certain doctrines Mackenzie taught that are \"signature Branham.\"\n\nDetectives told local newspaper People Daily Kenya that \"Mackenzie brainwashed his converts using William Branham's End of Days Theology.\" Investigators found Voice of God Recordings booklets containing Branham sermons inside abandoned homes near the mass graves.\n\nLike Branham, Mackenzie was \"obsessed with the end of the world,\" Ross said. They both told their followers to prepare for an apocalypse that could come any day -- a doctrine that makes followers easy to manipulate, Ross said.\n\n\"The reason that the people starved to death was they were fasting and praying in preparation for the end,\" Ross said.\n\nBranham preached that there's \"nothing\" in the Bible that justifies fasting to the point of starvation, supporters point out. \"Usually in a fast, I never feel hungry. If you feel hungry, it's time to eat,\" Branham said in 1953.\n\nEvans said Voice of God Recordings \"has never had any contact or association\" with Mackenzie. The recent tragedy \"is the farthest thing from The Message that you can get,\" he said.\n\n\"To associate this Kenya pastor with The Message because he had a few of Rev. Branham's sermons in his church library is absurd,\" Evans said. \"It would be like blaming Billy Graham, Joel Osteen or Kenneth Copeland for his actions because he had their books in the church library.\"\n\nRoss said it's unsurprising that Voice of God Recordings would want to distance themselves from Mackenzie.\n\n\"Of course, nobody wants to say, 'Oh yeah, Paul Mackenzie. Yeah, I'm aware of him, and he believes some of what we teach, and he's been influenced by some of what we put out there,'\" Ross said. \"Nobody wants to admit that given that he's now considered ... the third-most destructive cult leader in modern history.\"\n\nJim Jones connection\n\nBranham also played a role in popularizing the ministry of the most deadly cult leader in modern history, the Rev. Jim Jones, according to a book on Jones' life written by journalist Tim Reiterman, who covered Jones' cult for the San Francisco Examiner.\n\nJones led hundreds to their deaths in 1978 in what is now known as the Jonestown massacre. Backed by guards armed with guns and crossbows, Jones ordered his followers at an isolated compound in Guyana to kill themselves by drinking cyanide-laced punch, according to Reiterman's book \"Raven: The Untold Story of the Rev. Jim Jones and His People.\" Those who resisted were murdered with forced injections of poison. Children and babies were force-fed the poison punch with syringes.\n\nMore than 900 people died, including 300 children. Jones died from a gunshot wound to the head, possibly self-inflicted.\n\nAbout 20 years before the massacre, Jones only had about 100 followers and was looking for ways to expand his ministry, Reiterman wrote. Jones enlisted Branham -- at the height of his fame as a faith healer -- to headline a Pentecostal religious convention from June 11 to June 15, 1956, in Indianapolis. The event drew more than 10,000 people, Reiterman reported.\n\nGlossary: Common words and phrases at Message churches\n\nThe Bride. End Times. Serpent's seed. These are some of the words and phrases you'll hear if you attend a Message church.\n\nBoth Jones and Branham used people's addresses, Social Security, phone and insurance policy numbers to tell people about their pasts and futures like \"fortune tellers,\" Reiterman wrote. The two preachers would then lay their hands on people in prayer and give them a good shove on the forehead with the healing power of the Holy Spirit. Those \"healed\" by Jones and Branham would fall to the floor twitching as the crowd cried out in praise, Reiterman said.\n\nThe publicity Jones received at the convention was \"invaluable\" to the growth of his ministry, Reiterman wrote.\n\nCollins said he confirmed at least two more events where Jones and Branham preached alongside each other. He credits Branham with helping launch Jones' career during the Indianapolis convention.\n\n\"Not long after that Jones began hosting and sponsoring William Branham's revival meetings in multiple states,\" Collins said.\n\nJoseph Branham said it's \"ludicrous\" to try to tie his father to Jim Jones.\n\n\"There is of course nothing William Branham ever taught that would support such an evil crime as Jim Jones made,\" he said.\n\nDoomsday colony\n\nCollins wrote that Jonestown bears \"striking similarities\" to a Branham-influenced colony in Chile: Colonia Dignidad.\n\n\"Both communes initially started as 'agricultural communities.' Both were led by a narcissistic authoritarian figure. Both communes regulated -- and deprived members of -- sleep, sex and more. Both resulted in horrific deaths of members,\" Collins wrote in his book, \"Weaponized Religion: From Latter Rain to Colonia Dignidad.\"\n\nThe Chilean colony started in 1955 in post-war West Germany when a preacher named Paul Schafer showed up to see Branham preach in Karlsruhe, said Carlos Basso, a Chilean journalist and author of a book on the religious sect Schafer founded, called La Secta Perfecta. Basso said Schafer offered himself and a collection of followers to provide security for the rest of the tour. Branham accepted.\n\nSchafer had already established an orphanage and a small religious colony of fundamentalist Christians in West Germany. After seeing Branham, he adopted more of the American preacher's doctrine and style, Basso said.\n\n\"Before Schafer got acquainted with Branham, he never said anything about the end of the world,\" Basso said. \"After that, he became convinced the world was going to stop spinning one day.\"\n\nJoseph Branham said even if these alleged connections are true, they're thin at best, and Schafer's group is in no way reflective of William Branham's ministry.\n\nIn those early years of the colony, Schafer was already being accused of molesting boys, and when he was charged by German authorities, he took off, Basso said. Finally, in 1961 he ended up in southern Chile and re-established his colony there. He called it Colonia Dignidad.\n\nSchafer retained some similarities to Branham's sect while creating his own little German world in the south of South America. As in many Branham churches and sects, the leader, Schafer, was considered a prophet who could communicate with God, referred to by residents as their \"permanent uncle.\"\n\nThe community he established treated the outside world as a demonic place to be feared, Basso said.\n\nBut the control was not just psychological: Fences surrounded the property, and Schafer used sensors and cameras to monitor the boundaries, Basso said. Those who escaped were tracked down ruthlessly and even tortured.\n\nAs the years passed, Schafer continued molesting boys, but eventually there were too few German boys of the age he preferred, 8 to 12, Basso said. That's when the colony began recruiting local families to supply their children through various ruses.\n\n\"He started to bribe the judges of the towns near Colonia to get boys from poor people adopted by him or by his friends,\" Basso said. \"Chilean boys -- very, very poor boys -- became the next victims of Schafer.\"\n\nCommunism loomed as the most tangible expression of evil in Schafer's worldview, as researcher Bruce Falconer wrote in a detailed account of Colonia Dignidad published in 2008 in The American Scholar. When military leaders overthrew socialist president Salvador Allende in 1973, Schafer offered the colony as a detention, torture and killing camp, Falconer explained.\n\nAs early as 1977, Amnesty International accused Colonia Dignidad of being a torture center for the military government. Killings probably took place there as well, maybe many of them, but Chilean investigators have scoured the property and been unable to clarify the full scope of the deaths there, Falconer and Basso reported.\n\nThat relationship with the dictatorship bought Schafer protection from his crimes for many years. It wasn't until 1996 that a Chilean judge issued a warrant for his arrest, on charges of child molestation, and later on charges of aiding in the disappearance of a left-wing activist.\n\nIn 2006, Schafer was convicted of molesting 25 children and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He died in prison in 2010.\n\nTrailer park commune\n\nShortly before Branham died in 1965, he visited an Arizona trailer park nestled in the woods along a quiet stream. He compared the Message commune, called \"The Park,\" to the Promised Land.\n\n\"To come here this morning and look, this fine little Jerusalem setting out here, little ... Goshen,\" Branham preached before the community in Prescott in 1964. \"I can see why you people would want to stay here.\"\n\nThe commune's leader, Leo Mercier, was one of the \"tape boys\" who recorded Branham's sermons. Branham said he always knew Mercier was made for \"something greater in life.\"\n\nMercier used Branham's blessing to paint himself as a sort of \"king\" or \"demi-prophet\" over the commune members, said Deborah Thibodeau, who grew up in the commune.\n\nThibodeau and about 100 other children were routinely beaten at the commune on Mercier's orders until The Park dissolved in 1975, according to Thibodeau, another former member and court records. There's also evidence that Mercier molested children, according to the California Supreme Court.\n\nLeaders revered\n\nAcross the U.S., men have used Branham's framework to seize power and create cultish communities, former members and experts say.\n\nIn Camp Verde, Arizona in 1992, Ross said he helped a young mother get her daughter out of a Branham cult called the Spoken Word Tabernacle. Authorities feared the pastor was planning a mass killing of his followers on Christmas of that year -- the date he predicted the world would end, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe pastor, also named Jim Jones, was sentenced to 28 years in prison for child molestation in a 1998 trial in Arizona, the Verde Independent reported. He was accused of sexually abusing two girls in his church.\n\nJones died in prison a couple of years after he was convicted.\n\nA Lee Enterprises and Arizona Daily Star investigation also found:\n\nA Tucson Message church where the pastor uses threats of hell and shunning to exert control over congregants' finances, health decisions and personal lives. Twenty former members said the church, Golden Dawn Tabernacle, has devolved into a \"cult.\"An Arkansas Message church where \"everyone reveres the leader almost as if he's God,\" former member Sarah Kiser said. She now calls the group a \"cult.\" Members cannot have TVs, listen to secular music or have friends outside church. Women must follow a strict dress code and cannot move out of their parents' homes until they marry.A polygamous Message group active from the early '80s to 2007 in western New York, central Ohio and Arkansas. The group believed their leader was the \"prophet\" or \"voice box of God\" who was preparing the world for \"Jesus's third and final coming,\" former member Naomi Wright said. She described the group as a \"cult.\"\n\nNo accountability\n\nBergen, who now runs an anti-Branham research website, said coverups are common in The Message. It's not just that there's no governing board to hold people accountable, Bergen said. When congregants believe they are part of the chosen \"Bride of Christ\" who will survive the rapture, they're motivated to sweep misconduct under the rug, he said.\n\n\"This stuff doesn't happen in a perfect church,\" Bergen said. \"So what do you have to do? You just gotta cover it up.\"\n\nFormer Message member Milton Rosa said he witnessed a lack of accountability at his church in Brazil.\n\nFour women accused Brazilian Message pastor Joaquim Gonçalves Silva of sexual abuse dating back to 2002, according to Metrópoles, a Brazilian news website.\n\nSilva denied the allegations. He died later in 2021 before he could be tried in court.\n\nRosa said church leaders were aware of other sexual abuse allegations against Silva years before.\n\n\"It came to light. People did nothing about it. And he continued doing it,\" Rosa said. \"People turned a blind eye to it.\"\n\nThe pattern, Rosa said, is that of powerful spiritual leaders like Silva using their influence and position to manipulate vulnerable people. It happened in Brazil, Kenya, Chile and Arizona and will continue across the globe, he said.\n\n\"We hear the story of the trailer park,\" Rosa said. \"That story is not only there. If you dig deep, you see that that story repeats, and it repeats over and over.\"\n\nAbout this series\n\nLee Enterprises investigative team and the Arizona Daily Star interviewed more than 50 former and current Message followers, experts and religious leaders for \"Twisted Message.\" The series examines the lack of accountability in a Christian religious sect called \"The Message.\" Some groups that claim to follow the faith have become controlling or destructive, including a Tucson church accused of being a \"cult,\" an Arizona trailer park commune that physically and sexually abused children in the 1960s and churches across the U.S. that allegedly treat women as \"second-class citizens.\" The year-long investigation is the first news-media account of The Message and its global influence.

        "source": "Premium Times Nigeria",
        "content": "The above was the question asked by Britons and the rest of the world on the afternoon of 22 May, 2013. Close to the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, Southeast London, two young men of British-Nigerian descent, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, attacked a 25-year old British Army soldier, Fusilier Lee Rigby, and killed him. Rigby was of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. It was a case of religious extremism. The soldier had been on off-duty and was walking along Wellington Street. His attackers mowed him down with a car, ran towards him and, like Jack the Ripper, stabbed him multiple times with knives and cleavers. A postmortem later reveal that Rigby died of \"multiple incised wounds.\" The two Nigerians then dragged Rigby's lifeless body to the main road and stood by, unperturbed, until the arrival of the police. They proudly proclaimed to passersby that Rigby's killing was to avenge the killing of Muslims by the British military. In his book, Christianity, Islam and Orisa Religion: Three Traditions in Comparison and Interaction (2016), respected Africanist of the University of Cambridge, late Professor JDY Peel tried to dissect how the two London-born, Christian boys of Yoruba background, who converted to Islam some years before, could engage in such horrendous act. Upon being charged to court a week after, Adebolajo brandished a Quran and shouted \"Allahu akbar!\"\n\nThe two young men's Yoruba people back home were horrified because such religious intolerance and extremism do not represent them. The question the world asked as both were found guilty on December 19, 2013 and sentenced to life imprisonment was, what has God got to do with snuffing life out of God's creation?\n\nNigerians asked that same question last week from Mrs. Oluremi Tinubu, Nigeria's First Lady and the National Security Adviser, Nuhu Ribadu. Their question is, what has God got to do with suborning Him to provide solutions to problems He gave man enough brain to dissect? A National Prayer Forum (NPF) is the vehicle for this heavenly search for the face of God. According to the DG of the National Prayer Forum, Chief Segun Afolorunikan, in a statement widely published last Monday, Nigerian Christians will, through the duo, meet at the National Ecumenical Centre \"for a week of intense prayer, with prayer warriors from various denominations focusing their efforts on the nation's adversities.\"\n\nWhile this piece was going to bed yesterday, a statement was issued by Mrs. Tinubu's office by her spokesperson, Busola Kukoyi which denied that she is organising any nation prayer. It read in part: \"Her Excellency, Senator Oluremi Tinubu, CON, is not organising a national prayer... a Christian and strong advocate of prayer and praying for Nigeria, (she) believes that prayer is an act that must be done willingly, conscientiously, and sincerely. She also believes that praying for Nigeria is the responsibility of every Nigerian, irrespective of religious belief, political affiliation, tribe, or language.\"\n\nThat statement is very curious. It smacks of the usual about-turn of politically exposed persons when faced with a boomerang of their ill-thought-out decisions. When this happens, they laden the hapless press with the charge of \"misrepresentation of facts\" and urging them \"to always cross-check their facts.\" The truth is, it is either the First Lady's office is suffering from extreme inefficiency or there is a huge pall of subterfuge surrounding this disclaimer. The initial statement claiming Mrs. Tinubu and Ribadu would be organizing a national prayer was widely published last Monday. It took the office one whole week to distance itself from it! So, I want to go ahead with this piece, believing that the rebuttal from Mrs. Tinubu does not mirror her well-known tendency to demystify and shroud critical national issues with a blanket of religion. If fraud or misrepresentation was behind Afolorunikan's earlier release, we wait to have the First Lady sue him. We are waiting, Your Excellency.\n\nPeter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in the 2023 election, provoked very critical issues surrounding this matter. Drilling down into religious practices in Nigeria and churches' relations with the Nigerian state, Obi made mess of Tinubu and Ribadu's spiked fascination with the hubris of development, rather than its science.\n\nContrariwise, in a comment deploring the Nigerian state's unholy interface in religion, Obi called for reforms to Nigeria's religious and political culture. If one could squeeze sense out of his intervention, Obi simply counsels that the Nigerian state must de-couple the centuries-old alliance between it and the church (and by that very fact, Islam). \"We live largely in a very unproductive society, that's why the only thing that is attractive here is politics and church. We need to dismantle it and we're gonna turn night vigil into night shifts so people can be productive,\" he said.\n\nFor decades now, religion has received the back of the tongue of Africans. It is accused of complicity in the continent's underdevelopment. Some even say that religion's total capture of the mind of the African is akin to the owner of a farm plantation who, aiming to hinder productivity and ensure barrenness and stagnation, gives his alagbaro (labourer) palm trees-laden farm to cultivate (afún ni je mó fé á yó tíí fún ni l'óko ìdí òpe ro).\n\nChristianity made its first-phase incursion into Nigeria through Warri and Benin in the 15 century. This made the two cities the first to witness Christian missionary's presence in Nigeria. Islam, on the reverse, arrived the country between 1000A.D and 1100 A.D., some five to six hundred years before Christianity. Since then, the two religions have acted like the proverbial sword out of its scabbard. There is no doubting that both religions have helped tremendously over centuries to tame the sub-human tendencies of the traditional African religion which they met. However, they left residue of evil practices that manifest in the values, institutions and world views which are at cross-purposes with those of the indigenous religion they met. To explain their twin good and persistent evil, the Yoruba compare them to, \"Idà ti jáde l'ákò, ó sì ní b'óhun ò m'èjè, òhun ò padà s'ákò.\" It simply translates to mean that the sword, out of the scabbard, has sworn that unless it guzzles blood, its return into its sheathe isn't certain.\n\nRich historical records have shown us that, at the beginning of the 20th century, traditional religion boasted of more followers than converts to Islam and Christianity. However, the two imported religions flourished during this century. It was the era of technological advancement which thoroughly overwhelmed traditional Africa. It was the century of the making of automobiles and airplanes which made nonsense of Africa's perceived crude metaphysics. Indigenous churches sprang up everywhere with mission bodies evangelizing the \"dark continent.\" They condemned Africa's religion as occult, its education as Dark Age, its culture Stone Age, while founding schools and hospitals to replace ancient, adjudged crude traditional healing methods. Agricultural implements also replaced modern methods of farming. This newness and 'wizardry' of the white colonialists completely took Africa by storm and the continent progressively began to buckle at its feet.\n\nObi's madness at how lowly religion has sunk in Nigeria and Oluremi Tinubu/Ribadu's denied decision to weaponize it in defence of the Tinubu government's lackluster performance must be put in proper contexts. There is no doubting the fact that Nigeria has become a very fertile soil for religion. The 21 century has also marked the collapse of virtually all the values preached for centuries by both Islam and Christianity. COVID-19 and the perceived insensitivity of western religion have equally upped the disdain for western religions. Despite reliance on western medicine for cure, Africans went back to their roots for salvage from the brutal claws of the virus. Nigerians believe that, though their forebears sacrificed all for religion, many of them dying in the process, when it was time for the religions to come to the rescue of the congregants, the greed and acquisitive tendencies of religious barons came to the fore. Churches even demanded tithes and offerings from congregants when it was obvious that they had no place of work to go. Traditional medicine, with its barks and roots, as well as the constitution of the black man, saved so many Africans from the rampaging pandemic, thus reducing the mortality of COVID on the people.\n\nImmediately the pandemic ceased its anger, churches and mosque attendance reduced. Rebellion against centuries-old orthodoxy of religion began to flourish. However, the hunger and poverty occasioned by bad leadership in Africa made Nigerians to scamper back to religion to save them. Hunger and lack are increasing church/Islam activities which include evangelistic outreaches, crusades, conferences, retreats, conventions, pilgrimages and night vigils. Religious fraudsters are more on the prowl. General Overseers are prospering from the naivety of congregants and are tweaking their baits of prosperity teachings. On the flipside, the lives of the worshippers are not getting better. There are also little corresponding spiritualities and moral growth noticeable in the lives of the people.\n\nWhile churches and mosques, as well as their leaders, are going home with loots from naïve congregants, there is a spike in cases of immorality. Recently, the RCCG suspended its pastors for homosexuality. If it cares to dig in, it will find out that lesbianism, rape, incest, theft and armed robbery abound among its clergy and laity. This can be replicated in many other churches. Among those who profess Islamic faith, you will find rabid terrorism supporters. A case in point is a former minister who publicly confessed sympathy for Al-Qaeda. Nothing happened to him. How do you, in the name of religion, support bloodshed?\n\nIt may be apt to say that, the more western religion is upon our people's heads, the more immoral and amoral they become. It must be said that, in all the ills above, Christianity seems to be the greatest culprit, far more than Islam. Miracles have become a fetish that Christian taskmasters use to hypnotize their captives. The more absent the leadership is in the lives of Nigerians, the stronger the religionists step in to offer hope. This hope is however most times fraudulent. They manipulate the people's vulnerability and impatience for a turn-around in their pain. For a deteriorating healthcare, faith healing entrepreneurs canvass vigils in church. This, most times, leads to deaths. You only need to listen to the narrative of how, in her last days, Nigeria's Minister of Information, Dora Akunyili fell prey to these charlatans who capitalized on her religious vulnerability to make her abandon orthodox medical remedy for supposed faith healing.\n\nMiracles in Nigeria have become synonymous with baits on a rat trap. So also the \"sowing seed,\" \"tithes,\" \"first fruit\" and \"offering\" shibboleths that have become objects of exploitation by religious Smart Alecs. One of the fora where they are marketed is vigil. Publicity is then given to the \"showers of miracles\" through early morning street preaching, radio, posters, televisions and newspapers. These have been on the upswing in the 21st century. The impression you get from all this is that miracle is functional and could be offered only by these church miracle marketers. When the young ones entered the fray, with the spate of joblessness and hopelessness in the country today, the hypocrisy behind miracles is further revealed. It has led to a rash of manipulated miracles and miracle-for-cash evangelism. In some situations, noticeable among Pentecostals, some pastors are apprehended patronising native doctors. There, human parts sacrifice, in exchange for accuracy of prophecies and obtaining power to grow large following are advertized.\n\nFrustrations with religions in Nigeria are leading many Africans back to Traditional African Religion (ATR). Some researchers have submitted that, Islam and Christianity have constituted a threat and a disruptive force to African tradition and custom for centuries. But that was until now when the scales on the people's eyes have begun to fall. While at its incursion, Islam and Christianity suppressed ATR, virtually strangulating it, the table is turning today. The people's cry for help to ATR today is almost similar to the one made to Osetura, the Chief Priest in Hubert Ogunde's Aye. Osetura always fights against evil forces and always triumphs against their machinations. \"Osetura, Olóyè awo, e má fi wá sílè fún'yà je\" the people cried. What we witness today is that, in Islam for example, traditional beliefs and practice of magic and medicine have wriggled themselves into Islam. Christianity too is heavily mopping up many traditions, culture and the so-called unscience of ancient Africa. For example, return to herbs as medical remedies has increased rapidly while in dispensation of justice, deities' speedy mediation is of greater preference to the snail speed justice of western religion.\n\nApart from religionists, governments and politicians also exploit religion to their advantage. Aware that religion blinds the people's ability to reason critically, they use affiliation with particular religions to recruit rabid supporters. This was what happened in the build-up to the 2023 elections. In that election, peering of religion membership in political party tickets became top issue of consideration by the electorate, rather than what the candidates were able to do for the people if elected.\n\nIn the last 18 months in Nigeria, hopelessness has pushed Nigerians more into unorthodox practices. Government daily manifests its incapacity to offer neither succor nor redemption to the people. Frustration and despondency grip the people despite federal spin doctors' spirited attempts to cobble together tissues of what they call nascent hope. It is getting clearer that government's absence from the lives of the people may be for far longer time to come. So, when Afolorunikan announced a national prayer that would feature the First Lady and Ribadu, what the people saw was another plan to use religion to hoodwink them. Only a few days ago, the military apprised Nigerians of the coming together of another terrorist group in Kebbi and Sokoto states called the Lukarawas. To the people, a national prayer to ward off hunger and insecurity was government's back-door acceptance that it was helpless to bring hope in these regards. It was tantamount to accepting that everyone is for themselves and God is for us all. The NSA's presence at a prayer session supplicating to God for the security of Nigeria would have been akin to him throwing his hands up in resignation. Biblical King Saul did same when he, at nocturne, crawled to consult the Witch of Endor. For Ribadu to have shipped responsibility back to God, same responsibility that people gave him because they thought he and his boss were capable of confronting them, and thus resigning to fate as this, the hopelessness of the people would have hit a higher Fahrenheit.\n\nObi's last week intervention on religion no doubt riled some regime backers and religion apostles. Speaking on a podcast, he argued that there is the need for Nigerians to shift focus from religion to productivity. \"It's attractive, politics and church, but it has to be dismantled. We are going to turn night vigil into night shift so that people can be productive.\" Obi used the two symbols of \"night vigil\" and \"night shifts\" to express growing frustration and concerns with how church Basilicas worth billions of Naira are springing up to replace empty factories and warehouses in Nigeria, and the irony the Basilicas pose as where jobless people go to plead with God to give them jobs. If you drill down into his submission however, it will seem to have brilliantly articulated the frustration of Nigerians with the alliance of politicians and religious barons. It also in a way responded to the idiotic call for prayers in Abuja to combat Nigerian government's inability to find solutions to the people's travails in its hands. Church and government have continually kept the people in the dark about their bondage using religion as the bait.\n\nApart from state funds that will be filtered into the bottomless pit of this rat race, with some Smart Alec smiling to the bank with Nigerian scarce resources, Mrs. Tinubu/Ribadu's gimmick would seem to have been, de-escalate mounting tensions against the man in Aso Rock and get the people into amorphous task of holding God responsible for their woes. The end of the prayer nonsense would have been nothing. Now that the angst of the people towards a so-called national prayer has pushed it into the trash receptacle, Madam Tinubu should get her husband to do more than encircling the perquisites of office and bear full responsibility for the stasis across Nigeria.\n\nThe truth is, we may not like Obi's bold articulation of the danger that the hurriedly quashed Remi Tinubu and Ribadu's gathering posed to Nigeria's quest for mental emancipation from the chokehold of religion. Religious entrepreneurs and their Man Fridays may not like his call for \"dismantling of churches\" whose euphemism is, breaking of the walls of ignorance surrounding religion. The truth however is that we must rethink this unholy alliance if we must build a productive society. No society advances by gathering to pray against its problems. Its leaders tackle them by thinking out of the box."

        "content": "The above was the question asked by Britons and the rest of the world in the afternoon of May 22, 2013. Close to the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, Southeast London, two young men of British-Nigerian descent, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, had attacked a 25-year old British Army soldier, Fusilier Lee Rigby, and killed him. Rigby was of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. It was a case of religious extremism. The soldier had been off-duty and was walking along Wellington Street.\n\nHis attackers mowed him down with a car, ran towards him and, like Jack the Ripper, stabbed him multiple times with knives and cleaver.\n\nA postmortem later revealed that Rigby died of \"multiple incised wounds\". The two Nigerians then dragged Rigby's lifeless body to the main road and stood by, unperturbed until the arrival of the police. They proudly proclaimed to passersby that Rigby's killing was to avenge the killing of Muslims by the British military.\n\nIn his book: \"Christianity, Islam and Orisa religion: Three traditions in comparison and interaction (2016),\" respected Africanist of the University of Cambridge, late Prof. JDY Peel, tried to dissect how the two London-born, Christian Yoruba-background boys, who converted to Islam some years before, could engage in such horrendous act. Upon being charged in court a week after, Adebolajo brandished a Quran and shouted Allahu akbar!\n\nThe two young men's Yoruba people back home were horrified because such religious intolerance and extremism do not represent them. The question the world asked as both were found guilty on December 19, 2013 and sentenced to life imprisonment was: What has God got to do with snuffing life out of God's creation?\n\nNigerians asked that same question last week from Mrs. Oluremi Tinubu, Nigeria's First Lady, and the National Security Adviser, Nuhu Ribadu. Their question is: What has God got to do with suborning Him to provide solutions to problems He gave man enough brain to dissect? A National Prayer Forum is the vehicle for this heavenly search for the face of God. According to the DG of the National Prayer Forum, Chief Segun Afolorunikan, in a statement widely published last Monday, Nigerian Christians will, through the duo, meet at the National Ecumenical Centre \"for a week of intense prayer, with prayer warriors from various denominations focusing their efforts on the nation's adversities.\"\n\nWhile this piece was going to bed yesterday, a statement was issued by Mrs. Tinubu's office by her spokesperson, Busola Kukoyi, which denied that she is organising any national prayer. It read in part: \"Her Excellency, Senator Oluremi Tinubu, CON, is not organising a national prayer... a Christian and strong advocate of prayer and praying for Nigeria, (she) believes that prayer is an act that must be done willingly, conscientiously, and sincerely. She also believes that praying for Nigeria is the responsibility of every Nigerian, irrespective of religious belief, political affiliation, tribe, or language.\"\n\nThat statement is very curious. It smacks of the usual about-turn of politically exposed persons when faced with a boomerang of their ill-thought-out decisions. When this happens, they laden the hapless press with the charge of \"misrepresentation of facts\" and urging them \"to always cross-check their facts.\" The truth is, it is either the First Lady's office is suffering from extreme inefficiency or there is a huge pall of subterfuge surrounding this disclaimer. The initial statement claiming Mrs. Tinubu and Ribadu would be organising a national prayer which was widely published last Monday. It took the office one whole week to distance itself from it! So, I want to go ahead with this piece, believing that the rebuttal from Mrs. Tinubu does not mirror her well-known tendency to demystify and shroud critical national issues with a blanket of religion. If fraud or misrepresentation was behind Afolorunikan's earlier release, we wait to have the First Lady sue him. We are waiting, Your Excellency.\n\nPeter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party in the 2023 election, provoked very critical issues surrounding this matter. Drilling down into religious practices in Nigeria and churches' relations with the Nigerian state, Obi made a mess of Tinubu and Ribadu's spiked fascination with the hubris of development, rather than its science.\n\nContrariwise, in a comment deploring the Nigerian state's unholy interface in religion, Obi called for reforms to Nigeria's religious and political culture. If one could squeeze sense out of his intervention, Obi simply advises that the Nigerian state must de-couple the centuries-old alliance between it and the church (and by that very fact, Islam). \"We live largely in a very unproductive society, that's why the only thing that is attractive here is politics and church. We need to dismantle it and we're gonna turn night vigil into night shifts so people can be productive,\" he said.\n\nFor decades now, religion has received the back of the tongue of Africans. It is accused of complicity in the continent's underdevelopment. Some even say that religion's total capture of the mind of the African is akin to the owner of a farm plantation who, aiming to hinder productivity and ensure barrenness and stagnation, gives his alagbaro (labourer) palm trees-laden farm to cultivate (afún ni je mó fé á yó tíí fún ni l'óko ìdí òpe ro).\n\nChristianity made its first-phase incursion into Nigeria through Warri and Benin in the 15th century. This made the two cities the first to witness Christian missionary's presence in Nigeria. Islam, on the reverse, arrived the country between 1000A.D and 1100 A.D., some five to six hundred years before Christianity. Since then, the two religions have acted like the proverbial sword out of its scabbard. There is no doubting that both religions have helped tremendously over centuries to tame the sub-human tendencies of the traditional African religion which they met. However, they left residue of evil practices that manifest in the values, institutions and world views which are at cross-purposes with those of the indigenous religion they met. To explain their twin good and persistent evil, the Yoruba compare them to, \"Idà ti jáde l'ákò, ó sì ní b'óhun ò m'èjè, òhun ò padà s'ákò.\" It simply translates to mean that the sword, out of the scabbard, has sworn that unless it guzzles blood, its return into its sheath isn't certain.\n\nRich historical records have shown us that, at the beginning of the 20th century, traditional religion boasted of more followers than converts to Islam and Christianity. However, the two imported religions flourished during this century. It was the era of technological advancement which thoroughly overwhelmed traditional Africa. It was the century of the making of automobiles and aeroplanes which made nonsense of Africa's perceived crude metaphysics. Indigenous churches sprang up everywhere with mission bodies evangelising the \"dark continent.\" They condemned Africa's religion as occult, its education as Dark Age, its culture Stone Age, while founding schools and hospitals to replace ancient, adjudged crude traditional healing methods. Agricultural implements also replaced modern methods of farming. This newness and 'wizardry' of the white colonialists completely took Africa by storm and the continent progressively began to buckle at its feet.\n\nObi's madness at how lowly religion has sunk in Nigeria and Oluremi Tinubu/Ribadu's denied decision to weaponize it in defence of the Tinubu government's lacklustre performance must be put in proper contexts. There is no doubting the fact that Nigeria has become a very fertile soil for religion. The 21st century has also marked the collapse of virtually all the values preached for centuries by both Islam and Christianity. COVID-19 and the perceived insensitivity of western religion have equally upped the disdain for western religions. Despite reliance on western medicine for cure, Africans went back to their roots for salvage from the brutal claws of the virus. Nigerians believe that, though their forebears sacrificed all for religion, many of them dying in the process, when it was time for the religions to come to the rescue of the congregants, the greed and acquisitive tendencies of religious barons came to the fore. Churches even demanded tithes and offerings from congregants when it was obvious that they had no place of work to go. Traditional medicine, with its barks and roots, as well as the constitution of the black man, saved so many Africans from the rampaging pandemic, thus reducing the mortality of COVID on the people.\n\nImmediately the pandemic ceased its anger, churches and mosque attendance reduced. Rebellion against centuries-old orthodoxy of religion began to flourish. However, the hunger and poverty occasioned by bad leadership in Africa made Nigerians to scamper back to religion to save them. Hunger and lack are increasing church/Islam activities which include evangelistic outreaches, crusades, conferences, retreats, conventions, pilgrimages and night vigils. Religious fraudsters are more on the prowl. General Overseers are prospering from the naivety of congregants and are tweaking their baits of prosperity teachings. On the flipside, the lives of the worshippers are not getting better. There are also little corresponding spiritualities and moral growth noticeable in the lives of the people.\n\nWhile churches and mosques, as well as their leaders, are going home with loot from naïve congregants, there is a spike in cases of immorality. Recently, the RCCG suspended its pastors for homosexuality. If it cares to dig in, it will find out that lesbianism, rape, incest, theft and armed robbery abound among its clergy and laity. This can be replicated in many other churches. Among those who profess Islamic faith, you will find rabid terrorism supporters. A case in point is a former minister who publicly confessed sympathy for Al-Qaeda. Nothing happened to him. How do you, in the name of religion, support bloodshed?\n\nIt may be apt to say that, the more western religion is upon our people's heads, the more immoral and amoral they become. It must be said that, in all the ills above, Christianity seems to be the greatest culprit, far more than Islam. Miracles have become a fetish that Christian taskmasters use to hypnotise their captives. The more absent the leadership is in the lives of Nigerians, the stronger the religionists step in to offer hope. This hope is however most times fraudulent. They manipulate the people's vulnerability and impatience for a turn-around in their pain. For deteriorating healthcare, faith healing entrepreneurs canvass vigils in church.

        "content": "We bow our heads in reverence, honouring the extraordinary life of Holy Messenger Margaret \"Maggie\" Mukosi (née Mpofu) who passed on this 23rd of October 2024. Born on the 5th of March 1936 in Shurugwi, Zimbabwe, she grew up in Mondoro under the care of her maternal grandparents. Her life's journey unfolded with purpose, guided by divine providence.\n\nIn 1953, she moved to Gweru to live with her sister. The following year, Maggie met Stephen Mukosi, a police officer stationed in Bulawayo who had travelled to Gweru. With her elder sister's guidance, Maggie and Stephen began their family, welcoming their first child that same year. They went on to have seven more children.\n\nMaggie faced a challenging period, suffering from septic ulcers that prevented her from eating certain foods, including mealiepap, for over four years. During this time in Gweru, she met Mrs. Violet Makaya, Mrs. Rosinah Chitate, and Mrs. Emily Zindoga, who used to travel to various places selling handcrafted doilies. They quickly formed a close bond, and Mrs. Makaya began preaching to Maggie about Guta RaMwari, where she could find healing for her ulcers. They also discovered that Mrs. Makaya's husband, Mr. Tadeus Makaya, was a blood relative to Mr. Mukosi.\n\nAs a result of Mrs. Makaya's persistence, Maggie, at age 26, and Stephen joined Guta RaMwari on April 6, 1962. Within two weeks, Maggie's septic ulcers were miraculously healed. At that time, Guta RaMwari was in Mpopoma South.\n\nIn 1963, she was overcome by a divine spirit that proclaimed through her mouth, \"Ndini MaPaulos\" (I am Paulous). Subsequently, she was commissioned to heal the sick by hand, becoming the second Holy Messenger, after Holy Messenger Chibuda, to be ordained since God's advent in Africa in His human Hosts. Similarly, a spirit named Gabriel manifested through Mrs. Makaya and began healing the sick by hand.\n\nAt that time, Holy Messengers were not formally announced as is the practice today; instead, they proclaimed their arrival and revealed their heavenly names such as Peter, John, Paul, Gabriel, Michael and others. Many other members of the religion experienced similar spiritual callings.\n\nLater, Holy Messenger Mukosi, alongside Evangelist Gordon Tshuma and Evangelist Josiah Mangena, was ordained as a member of the Chosen 12. This was in addition to the original 12 families who had joined the great transition from Guta RaJehova to Guta RaMwari. During that era, the healing of the sick and troubled was often instantaneous. Those who committed themselves to the religion witnessed profound transformations, often within a very short time.\n\nThe presence of God's Spirit was undeniably upon them. A tremendous amount of spiritual work was accomplished during that time. Though invisible, the Holy Spirit could be felt flowing through her fingers, like water streaming through the body. Holy Messenger Mukosi would often rub her hands together as she walked, attempting to ease this unusual sensation, until one day, the Voice rebuked her, urging her to let the Spirit flow freely.\n\nTogether with Holy Messenger Makaya, Holy Messenger Mukosi was deployed to various areas of Botswana, including Maun, Tshesebe, Mathangwane, and Mahikeng in South Africa, where they sought out the sick and troubled. In Zimbabwe, she was deployed to establish branches in Tokwana, Harare, Zimuto, Masvingo, and Victoria Falls, among others, which remain spiritual healing centres to this day. Through her unwavering dedication, many attest to being drawn to Guta RaMwari and receiving the salvation they had longed for.\n\nShe was at the Tshesebe branch when, on one memorable December 25th, Holy Messenger Makaya was sent to sanctify a sacrificial lamb for the Departure Commemoration. Subsequently, Holy Messenger Maggie Mukosi was commissioned to perform the same at the Tokwana Branch which was under the leadership of Evangelist Kwetje Nleya.\n\nFurthermore, since 1964, Holy Messenger Mukosi, among others, had been a respected elder in the religion, known for her extensive knowledge of virginity testing which is a cultural and spiritual practice in Guta RaMwari through which young people voluntarily participate to uphold and preserve their chastity.\n\nAt 88, Holy Messenger Margaret Mukosi's remarkable life has come full circle, her legacy forever etched in the hearts of God's children in Guta RaMwari and beyond. Her body was buried on Sunday the 27th of October 2024 at Athlone Cemetery in Bulawayo. Today, we pause to honour her extraordinary journey, rejoicing in the knowledge that she now joins the celestial realm, embraced by fellow Holy Messengers with open arms, for death is a transformative stage where a soul departs from this world and enters the invisible realm. Indeed, physical life has an expiring term. May her exemplary life inspire us to live with purpose, leaving an enduring impact on those we touch.\n\nEverlastingly.\n\nMpumelelo Ncube writes in his personal capacity in honour of the departed heroine."

        "content": "Judgment: Exposing the Depths of Indoctrination and Criminality\n\nThe Catholic Church, as critiqued in Revelation and Gareth Gore's Opus, symbolizes the entrenchment of spiritual control through indoctrination and the perpetuation of systemic criminality. To move toward redemption, a robust process of judgment is necessary.\n\n1. Deconstructing Indoctrination:\n\nTheological Authority: Catholicism's hierarchical dogma demands uncritical obedience, suppressing individual spiritual growth. A reinterpretation of Revelation's warning against the \"Mother of Prostitutes\" (Rev. 18:3) reveals how such systems manipulate faith to maintain control.\n\nEducation and Mind Control: Historical practices, including catechesis and missionary efforts, have often reinforced colonial and cultural domination under the guise of salvation. Modern educational initiatives must confront this legacy by fostering critical thinking and autonomy.\n\n2. Confronting the Criminal Nexus:\n\nSystemic Abuse and Cover-Ups: The global scale of clergy abuse scandals underscores the Church's complicity in harboring and shielding perpetrators. International legal mechanisms, such as the ICC, must intervene to hold the Vatican accountable for crimes against humanity.\n\nFinancial Corruption: Revelation's imagery of wealth and opulence (Rev. 18:12-13) mirrors modern revelations about Vatican finances. Transparency and accountability must be enforced through independent audits and legal sanctions.\n\nRedemption lies not in reforming the Catholic Church as it exists but in liberating humanity from its indoctrination and rebuilding spiritual practices that prioritize authenticity, connection, and justice.\n\n1. Spiritual Liberation:\n\nPersonal Spiritual Autonomy: Redemption begins with individuals reclaiming their spiritual agency. Practices such as meditation, mindfulness, and direct engagement with sacred texts allow for unmediated spiritual experiences.\n\nCommunity-Based Faith: Decentralizing spiritual authority by fostering local, inclusive spiritual communities dismantles hierarchical control while encouraging interconnectivity and mutual support.\n\n2. Restorative Justice:\n\nAccountability for Crimes: Redemption requires reparations for the Church's historical and modern victims. Restorative justice models should prioritize victim healing, transparency, and systemic change.\n\nReallocating Wealth: The Church's immense resources should be redirected to address poverty, inequality, and the global consequences of its exploitative practices.\n\n3. Cultural and Educational Renewal:\n\nBreaking Indoctrination Cycles: Educational systems must empower individuals to critically evaluate religious narratives. Courses on comparative religion and secular ethics can provide alternative frameworks for morality and spirituality.\n\nPromoting Interconnectivity: Drawing from neuroplasticity research, fostering open-mindedness and compassion can counteract the psychological rigidity instilled by dogmatic indoctrination.\n\n1. Judgment as Liberation: Revelation's apocalyptic vision symbolizes the necessary destruction of corrupt systems like Catholicism to enable a new, untainted spiritual foundation. This echoes Opus's narrative of systemic collapse as a precursor to individual and collective renewal.\n\n2. Redemption Through Reconnection: By dismantling the structures of oppression, humanity can restore interconnectivity on both a spiritual and societal level. Practices like Qigong, meditation, and direct service to others embody this vision of wholeness and harmony.\n\n3. Global Responsibility: The fall of Catholicism as an institution provides an opportunity for societies to reflect on the broader role of religion in perpetuating power imbalances. A unified approach -- rooted in justice, accountability, and compassion -- offers hope for an equitable and spiritually vibrant future.\n\nJudgment against Catholicism's indoctrination and criminal nexus is not merely punitive but essential for global spiritual and moral renewal. As Revelation and Opus illustrate, the collapse of corrupt institutions paves the way for a deeper connection to truth, justice, and authentic spirituality. Redemption lies in embracing this transformative process, fostering a society that prioritizes individual autonomy, community well-being, and universal justice over institutionalized oppression.\n\nThe Catholic Church, as critiqued in Revelation and modern analyses, has historically used psychological, social, and cultural mechanisms to maintain control and deflect accountability. Avoiding entanglement with this nexus and criminalizing its systemic failures requires an interdisciplinary approach, combining psychology, sociology, and legal action.\n\n---\n\n1. Understanding the Psychological Mechanisms of Entanglement\n\n1.1 Indoctrination and Cognitive Entrapment\n\nMechanism: Indoctrination exploits cognitive biases such as authority bias, confirmation bias, and in-group favoritism to foster blind loyalty and suppress critical thinking.\n\nImpact: Individuals raised within Catholic structures often internalize hierarchical worldviews, moral absolutism, and guilt-based control mechanisms.\n\nScientific Insights:\n\nStudies in neuroplasticity show how early exposure to dogmatic teachings can hardwire submissive thought patterns, making deprogramming critical.\n\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) offers effective methods for challenging ingrained beliefs and reclaiming autonomy.\n\n1.2 Social Conditioning and Peer Influence\n\nMechanism: The Church reinforces compliance through social rituals, peer pressure, and communal identity, creating fear of ostracism.\n\nImpact: This conditioning inhibits dissent and perpetuates cycles of dependence on institutional authority.\n\nScientific Insights:\n\nSocial learning theory demonstrates how behavior is modeled and reinforced by observing authority figures and peers.\n\nTechniques like assertiveness training can empower individuals to resist undue influence.\n\n1.3 Guilt and Fear as Tools of Control\n\nMechanism: Catholic teachings often emphasize sin, guilt, and eternal punishment, instilling fear-based compliance.\n\nImpact: These emotions create psychological entanglements, trapping individuals in cycles of shame and dependency.\n\nScientific Insights:\n\nEmotion regulation strategies and exposure therapy help individuals dismantle these fears and reclaim emotional freedom.\n\nSolution: Promoting education that encourages critical analysis of religious claims, emphasizing comparative religion and secular ethics.\n\nImplementation:\n\nIntroducing curricula that explore psychological manipulation in institutions.\n\nTeaching logical fallacies and cognitive biases to strengthen individual reasoning skills.\n\n2.2 Building Resilient Communities\n\nSolution: Creating support networks outside of religious frameworks to reduce social dependency on the Church.\n\nImplementation:\n\nDeveloping inclusive, secular spaces for social connection and mutual aid.\n\nEncouraging mindfulness and other spiritual practices that emphasize personal growth over institutional allegiance.\n\n2.3 Psychological Resilience Training\n\nSolution: Empowering individuals with tools to recognize and resist manipulation.\n\nImplementation:\n\nTraining in CBT and emotional regulation techniques.\n\nEncouraging personal autonomy through practices like meditation and journaling.\n\n3.1 Legal and Psychological Barriers to Accountability\n\nChallenges:\n\nPsychological manipulation fosters loyalty among followers, who often resist external scrutiny.\n\nThe Church's hierarchical structure and global reach complicate legal interventions.\n\nInternational human rights law must be invoked to address abuse scandals and financial crimes.\n\nIndependent investigations, such as those conducted by Truth and Reconciliation Commissions, can reveal systemic corruption.\n\nBreaking Diplomatic Immunity:\n\nVatican City's status as a sovereign entity has shielded it from prosecution. Efforts to revise international agreements can remove this protection.\n\n3.3 Psychological Contributions to Legal Processes\n\nForensic Psychology in Testimonies:\n\nUsing trauma-informed approaches to support survivors in providing evidence.\n\nEmploying psychological profiling to identify patterns of abuse and cover-ups.\n\nCommunity Mobilization:\n\nEmpowering former members to come forward by creating safe, supportive spaces.\n\nLeveraging collective action to demand transparency and restitution.\n\nInternational Collaboration: Nations must collaborate to ensure crimes by the Church are universally prosecutable.\n\nCultural Shifts: Societal norms must shift from reverence for institutions to prioritizing individual rights and justice.\n\n4.2 Empowering Survivors and Communities\n\nHealing Programs: Trauma-informed therapies, such as EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), can help survivors recover.\n\nReparative Justice: Resources amassed by the Church should be redirected to survivor compensation and community rebuilding.\n\n4.3 Alternative Spiritual Models\n\nEncouraging non-hierarchical spiritual movements focused on mindfulness, inclusivity, and personal growth as alternatives to institutionalized religion.\n\n---\n\n5. Conclusion: A Vision of Liberation and Accountability\n\nAvoiding entanglement with Catholicism's nexus and criminalizing its systemic corruption requires a synthesis of psychological insight, legal strategy, and cultural reform. By addressing the mechanisms of indoctrination and fostering individual and societal resilience, humanity can dismantle oppressive institutions and build pathways to justice and spiritual renewal. Through education, legal action, and community empowerment, the vision of liberation from the Catholic nexus can be realized.\n\nThis paper critically examines the symbolic and thematic parallels between the \"Mother of Prostitutes\" in Revelation 18 and the explicit critique of Catholicism as an institution in Gareth Gore's Opus. Revelation portrays the \"Mother of Prostitutes\" as a harbinger of systemic corruption and spiritual decadence, a description echoed in Gore's portrayal of institutionalized religion. By using interdisciplinary frameworks -- including sociology, political theory, and philosophy -- this analysis dissects the interconnected roles of Catholicism and broader institutional failures, emphasizing pathways for spiritual renewal amidst institutional collapse.\n\nRevelation 18 portrays the \"Mother of Prostitutes\" as a city of wealth, moral decay, and spiritual adultery. Historical and interpretative traditions have frequently identified this figure with the Catholic Church, citing its accumulation of wealth, global influence, and history of excess.\n\nKey Themes:\n\nLuxury and Exploitation: Revelation 18:3 states that \"the kings of the earth committed adultery with her,\" symbolizing collusion between the Catholic Church and political powers.\n\nMoral Hypocrisy: The Catholic Church's history, including its handling of abuse scandals and financial corruption, mirrors Revelation's indictment of a \"great city\" deceiving nations with false spirituality.\n\n1.2 Theoretical Frameworks\n\nWalter Wink's Engaging the Powers explores institutionalized evil and the systemic nature of corruption, aligning with the critique of Catholicism as a power structure.\n\nSlavoj Žižek's The Sublime Object of Ideology provides a lens for understanding the Catholic Church's role in sustaining ideological control over spiritual narratives.\n\nGareth Gore's Opus directly addresses the Catholic Church as a central figure in institutional spiritual corruption. Gore highlights key failings, such as the exploitation of vulnerable populations, the prioritization of wealth and influence over spiritual authenticity, and the perpetuation of dogmas that inhibit individual spiritual growth.\n\nKey Parallels to Revelation 18:\n\nCollusion with Power: The Catholic Church's historical alliances with empires and governments reflect Revelation's depiction of kings giving their power to the Beast (17:12-13).\n\nMoral and Financial Corruption: The lavish lifestyles of certain church leaders and the misuse of church funds echo Revelation 18:7: \"She glorified herself and lived in luxury.\"\n\n2.2 Philosophical and Political Implications\n\nCarl Schmitt's The Concept of the Political discusses how institutions like the Catholic Church intertwine with political structures, consolidating power while undermining accountability.\n\nGuy Debord's The Society of the Spectacle critiques the Church's use of spectacle and ritual to maintain authority and control.\n\n---\n\n3. Revelation 19: Judgment Against Catholicism as a Corrupt Institution\n\n3.1 The Beast, the Prostitute, and the Church\n\nRevelation 19 envisions the destruction of the Beast and the False Prophet, symbols of oppressive power structures. This judgment resonates with Opus's call for the collapse of Catholicism as a spiritually corrupt institution.\n\nDivine Justice and Human Agency: While Revelation emphasizes divine intervention, Opus highlights human agency in exposing and dismantling the Church's systemic failures.\n\nPhilosophical Insights: Michel Foucault's Discipline and Punish provides a framework for understanding the Catholic Church's methods of control, including surveillance, confession, and ritualized authority.\n\n3.2 Historical Contexts\n\nThe Protestant Reformation as a precursor to Opus's critique, challenging Catholicism's accumulation of power and wealth.\n\nScandals within the Church, including financial mismanagement and abuse cover-ups, as modern fulfillments of Revelation's warnings.\n\nRevelation 20's depiction of Satan's binding symbolizes liberation from institutional oppression, paralleling Opus's vision of a spiritual awakening independent of the Catholic Church's influence.\n\nKey Themes in Opus:\n\nThe necessity of dismantling the Catholic Church's hierarchical structures to achieve true spiritual freedom.\n\nIndividual spiritual practices as a pathway to renewal.\n\n4.2 Psychological and Sociological Reflections\n\nViktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning highlights the importance of personal spiritual autonomy, resonating with Opus's emphasis on individual growth.\n\nNeuroplasticity research offers insights into how individuals can rewire their spiritual and moral frameworks beyond institutional constraints.\n\nRevelation and Opus converge in their critique of Catholicism's role as a corrupt institution, urging accountability and transparency as necessary steps toward renewal.\n\nPractical Lessons:\n\nEncouraging spiritual practices that are independent of institutional mediation, such as mindfulness and meditation.\n\nPromoting community-based spiritual movements that prioritize authenticity over hierarchy.\n\n5.2 Relevance to Modern Audiences\n\nBoth texts emphasize the enduring dangers of institutional corruption, particularly when spiritual authority is used to exploit and manipulate. Revelation's apocalyptic warnings and Opus's narrative critique serve as reminders of the need for vigilance and reform in religious institutions.\n\nRevelation 18-20 and Gareth Gore's Opus present a unified critique of Catholicism as an institution embodying systemic corruption and spiritual decay. While Revelation offers a prophetic vision of judgment and renewal, Opus grounds its critique in contemporary realities, urging readers to confront the failures of the Church and seek spiritual liberation. Together, these texts provide a compelling framework for understanding the intersection of institutional power, moral integrity, and the potential for transformative renewal.\n\nA Vision for Judgment and Redemption from Catholicism's Indoctrination and Criminal Nexus\n\nJudgment: Exposing the Depths of Indoctrination and Criminality\n\nThe Catholic Church, as critiqued in Revelation and Gareth Gore's Opus, symbolizes the entrenchment of spiritual control through indoctrination and the perpetuation of systemic criminality. To move toward redemption, a robust process of judgment is necessary.\n\n1. Deconstructing Indoctrination:\n\nTheological Authority: Catholicism's hierarchical dogma demands uncritical obedience, suppressing individual spiritual growth. A reinterpretation of Revelation's warning against the \"Mother of Prostitutes\" (Rev. 18:3) reveals how such systems manipulate faith to maintain control.\n\nEducation and Mind Control: Historical practices, including catechesis and missionary efforts, have often reinforced colonial and cultural domination under the guise of salvation. Modern educational initiatives must confront this legacy by fostering critical thinking and autonomy.\n\n2. Confronting the Criminal Nexus:\n\nSystemic Abuse and Cover-Ups: The global scale of clergy abuse scandals underscores the Church's complicity in harboring and shielding perpetrators. International legal mechanisms, such as the ICC, must intervene to hold the Vatican accountable for crimes against humanity.\n\nFinancial Corruption: Revelation's imagery of wealth and opulence (Rev. 18:12-13) mirrors modern revelations about Vatican finances. Transparency and accountability must be enforced through independent audits and legal sanctions.\n\nRedemption lies not in reforming the Catholic Church as it exists but in liberating humanity from its indoctrination and rebuilding spiritual practices that prioritize authenticity, connection, and justice.\n\n1. Spiritual Liberation:\n\nPersonal Spiritual Autonomy: Redemption begins with individuals reclaiming their spiritual agency. Practices such as meditation, mindfulness, and direct engagement with sacred texts allow for unmediated spiritual experiences.\n\nCommunity-Based Faith: Decentralizing spiritual authority by fostering local, inclusive spiritual communities dismantles hierarchical control while encouraging interconnectivity and mutual support.\n\n2. Restorative Justice:\n\nAccountability for Crimes: Redemption requires reparations for the Church's historical and modern victims. Restorative justice models should prioritize victim healing, transparency, and systemic change.\n\nReallocating Wealth: The Church's immense resources should be redirected to address poverty, inequality, and the global consequences of its exploitative practices.\n\n3. Cultural and Educational Renewal:\n\nBreaking Indoctrination Cycles: Educational systems must empower individuals to critically evaluate religious narratives. Courses on comparative religion and secular ethics can provide alternative frameworks for morality and spirituality.\n\nPromoting Interconnectivity: Drawing from neuroplasticity research, fostering open-mindedness and compassion can counteract the psychological rigidity instilled by dogmatic indoctrination.\n\n1. Judgment as Liberation: Revelation's apocalyptic vision symbolizes the necessary destruction of corrupt systems like Catholicism to enable a new, untainted spiritual foundation. This echoes Opus's narrative of systemic collapse as a precursor to individual and collective renewal.\n\n2. Redemption Through Reconnection: By dismantling the structures of oppression, humanity can restore interconnectivity on both a spiritual and societal level. Practices like Qigong, meditation, and direct service to others embody this vision of wholeness and harmony.\n\n3. Global Responsibility: The fall of Catholicism as an institution provides an opportunity for societies to reflect on the broader role of religion in perpetuating power imbalances. A unified approach -- rooted in justice, accountability, and compassion -- offers hope for an equitable and spiritually vibrant future.\n\nJudgment against Catholicism's indoctrination and criminal nexus is not merely punitive but essential for global spiritual and moral renewal. As Revelation and Opus illustrate, the collapse of corrupt institutions paves the way for a deeper connection to truth, justice, and authentic spirituality. Redemption lies in embracing this transformative process, fostering a society that prioritizes individual autonomy, community well-being, and universal justice over institutionalized oppression.\n\n5.3 A Call for Incrimination: Exposing Corruption\n\nRevelation and Opus not only critique Catholicism but also demand active exposure of its systemic failings. Both texts align in their calls for holding the Catholic Church accountable for historical and modern injustices.\n\n5.3.1 Historical Accountability\n\nExploitation of Wealth: The Church's historical accumulation of riches at the expense of the poor aligns with Revelation's depiction of the prostitute's luxury (Rev. 18:7). Investigations into Vatican finances continue to expose irregularities and scandals that demand transparency and restitution.\n\nComplicity with Political Powers: From the Holy Roman Empire to modern-day concordats, Catholicism has often served as a tool for political agendas. Revelation's warning of kings' complicity (Rev. 18:3) underscores the need to interrogate such alliances.\n\n5.3.2 Modern Failings\n\nClergy Abuse Scandals: Global revelations of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church highlight an ongoing crisis. Gore's Opus mirrors these concerns, calling for uncompromising justice for victims and systemic reform.\n\nObstruction of Justice: Attempts by the Church to shield perpetrators from legal consequences parallel Revelation's warnings of deceptive leadership (Rev. 18:23). International legal bodies must act decisively to ensure accountability.\n\n5.3.3 Theological Consequences\n\nBy institutionalizing power, Catholicism risks embodying Revelation's condemned systems. The Church's dogmatic authority must be questioned and reformed, as its unchecked control directly contradicts the scriptural calls for humility and service.\n\n6.1 Legal Action Against Institutional Corruption\n\nInternational Law and Human Rights: Courts such as the International Criminal Court (ICC) must address cases where Catholicism has enabled systemic abuse or colluded with oppressive regimes.\n\nFinancial Transparency: Independent audits of Vatican accounts and diocesan finances should be mandated to dismantle any networks of corruption.\n\n6.2 Reformation of Institutional Structures\n\nDecentralization of Power: Revelation's vision of the prostitute's fall (Rev. 18:21) illustrates the dangers of centralizing spiritual authority. A decentralized, community-focused Church model could reduce abuses of power.\n\nLay Empowerment: Increasing the role of laypersons in decision-making bodies offers a path toward greater transparency and accountability.\n\n6.3 Cultural and Educational Shifts\n\nEncouraging Critical Thinking: Public awareness campaigns and education initiatives can empower individuals to question and hold institutions accountable.\n\nFostering Individual Spirituality: Encouraging practices like mindfulness, meditation, and direct community service can counter the hierarchical control of spirituality.\n\n---\n\n7. The Role of Prophecy and Literature in Transformation\n\n7.1 Revelation as a Blueprint for Judgment\n\nRevelation's apocalyptic vision is not merely predictive but prescriptive, urging readers to confront and dismantle corrupt systems like Catholicism. Its vivid imagery and dire warnings demand a reckoning with historical and modern abuses of power.\n\n7.2 Opus as a Literary Call to Action\n\nGareth Gore's Opus amplifies Revelation's critique by contextualizing its warnings in contemporary settings. Its portrayal of institutional failures challenges readers to act against the commodification of spirituality and seek authentic faith.\n\n7.3 Interdisciplinary Support for Reform\n\nTheological critiques alone are insufficient; sociological, psychological, and legal frameworks must converge to address the systemic issues within Catholicism. Revelation and Opus invite a multidisciplinary response to dismantle oppressive institutions and rebuild on principles of justice and integrity.\n\n7.4 A Vision of Redemption Beyond Incrimination\n\nWhile Revelation and Opus expose Catholicism's failings, both also offer hope for spiritual renewal. Redemption lies in dismantling the corrupt structures and rebuilding communities focused on service, humility, and genuine faith. Individuals must reclaim their spiritual agency, fostering interconnectivity and healing on a societal level.\n\n---\n\nConclusion: The Necessity of Accountability and Reform\n\nRevelation 18-20 and Opus provide a comprehensive indictment of Catholicism as an institution embodying systemic corruption and moral decay. Their combined critique transcends theological debate, calling for tangible action: legal accountability, structural reform, and personal spiritual liberation. As prophecy and literature converge, they offer a path not only for exposing injustice but for envisioning a renewed society free from institutionalized oppression.\n\nThis paper concludes that only through confronting the Church's failures and dismantling oppressive systems can humanity achieve the spiritual renewal foreseen in Revelation's eschatological vision.\n\n--   --   --\n\nThis paper directly addresses the role of Catholicism in Revelation's apocalyptic warnings and Opus's literary critique, offering a critical lens to examine the intersection of institutional power and spiritual redemption."

        "content": "Journalism is one profession that exposes the practitioners to several segments of life and its realities, this exclusive interview by EVEREST EZIHE of The Authority Newspaper to Lady Betha Uchechukwu Nnaji, popularly known as Eze Nwanyi Okitankwu is not an exemption. She revealed a lot of shocking mysteries behind her birth and spiritual prowess, her betrothment to the famous but mysterious Okitankwu River and the need for Ndigbo and Africans in general to go back to their roots. It's an incisive humanitarian perspective of a MUST read and with exquisite depository of in-depth knowledge of traditional spirituality and divinity.\n\nEZE NWANYI OKITANKWU, MAY YOU GIVE OUR GLOBAL READERS AN INSIGHT OF YOUR PROFILE ?\n\nMy name is Betha Uchechukwu Nnaji, a native of Akalaovo in Umuakaliukwu Emekuku autonomous community in Owerri North Local Government Area of Imo State. Born in mid 80's to Mr Emmanuel Okechukwu Nnaji, who is now late and, am dearly missing him and Mrs Enyioma Nelly Nnaji (nee Ohiagu, from Mbarakuma Ubakala Abia State), am the first child of the nuclear family of 5. A lot of mysteries were associated with my birth including having dreadlock hairstyles. I started my early education in Port Harcourt, Rivers State where I was born. Then, my secondary education was at Seven Days Adventist Technical Secondary School, Owerrinta, Abia State based on the need to be closer home so as to monitor me, I was later brought to Emekuku Girls Secondary School, Owerri North LGA of Imo State, but now Mount Carmel Secondary School, Emekuku. My university education was at University of Calabar, however, I had further studies at Alvan Ikoku College of Education, Owerri. I have been around as Owerri woman, I grew up here and am proud of that.\n\nYOU TALKED ABOUT COMMENCING YOUR SECONDARY SCHOOL CAREER AT SEVEN DAYS ADVENTIST SCHOOL, WHERE YOU A CHRISTIAN AND OF WHICH DENOMINATION ?\n\nI was born into an Adventist christian church family, courtesy of my mother, who's an adherent.\n\nYOU TALKED ABOUT BEEN A STUDENT OF UNIVERSITY OF CALABAR AND ALVAN IKOKU COLLEGE OF EDUCATION, WHAT IS ACTUALLY YOUR DISCIPLINE ?\n\nAt the University of Calabar, I was looking forward studying Medicine and Surgery, due to intricacies of admission, I opted for Anatomy, however, I was probably frustrated out by both the system and divine nature, then I doggedly went in and studied Microbiology, but at Alvan Ikoku College of Education, Owerri ( now, Federal University of Education Owerri) I studied, Early Child Care Education.\n\nHOW THEN, DID YOU BECOME THE EZE NWANYI OF OKITANKWU RIVER ?\n\nI have always being a special child. My birth is shrouded with lots of mysteries as I earlier said, obliviously unknown to the family. There is something spectacular about my childhood. Growing up, I used to foretell things, I used to receive messages from my ancestors, I used to miraculously heal people, I used to give people divine messages and it happens. I always predict things before they happened. I have the spiritual gifts of revelations. These and many other mysteries of life were bestowed in me by nature which is the universe. Before the era of mobile telecommunications, my parents uses me to know when any visitor or visitors is coming to our house. Unknown to the visitor or visitors, l will predict the exact date and time. I use to foretell the future and I still foretells the future, am not an ordinary person, am a special child created by the universe for special purposes of helping humanity to know their future and themselves. Thus why, the divine works am doing today, I never learnt it from any body. All I do today, is purely based on divine directives and it works, moreover, as my hands are clean. I have NEVER predicted or foretell any thing and it did not come to pass with 100% precision. The different between me and most of the people who says they are seers or prophets or prophetesses is that I don't publicized what the universe uses me to do, it is only the beneficiaries or witnesses that does that, based on what they see, experienced and conviction.\n\nHOW DID YOU DEVELOP TO THIS LEVEL THAT YOUR ANCESTRAL COMPOUND HAS BECOME A DAILY UPSURGE, LIKENED TO MECCA OR JERUSALEM, FOR BOTH SMALL AND HIGH PROFILED PERSONS, SEEKING SPIRITUAL SOLUTIONS TO THEIR PROBLEMS ?\n\nI never attended any school of spiritualism nor have tutelage under any body, but certain time of my life, good and healing spirits visits me, we interact and they gives me directives on what to do concerning any ailment or problem, in the overall interest and benefits of humanity. They know, am a humanist, and am born to be a spiritual solution to human spiritual needs and problems. Am a disciple and an Ambassador of recarnation.Even as a child, I used to see dead people in my dreams or trance, we communicates, and I used to tell my mother, father and other person's closed to me, then alot of mysterious things happening within my well being and others, if they tarry and investigate, they always find it to be true.\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR SPECIALITIES IN THESE SPIRITUAL WORKS ?\n\nI do healings, restorations, foretelling and predicting the future, I can tell you your ancestral roots, I can restore you to your normal being if you have psychiatric issue or issues, I can accurately tell you your future. I heal people alot, I help barren women and men to have babies. I do alot of spiritual works as the spirit directs. I don't do any spiritual work if am not directed by the universe.\n\nYOU HEAL PEOPLE FROM SPIRITUAL AFFINITIES, CAN YOU MENTION ONE THAT RECENTLY STRIKES YOU ?\n\nOne, Mr. Favour Ugochukwu from Azaraegbuelu Emekuku, Owerri North. He ran mad and had psychiatric disorders and was the only son of his parents. His people consulted me. The only time I saw him was when I finished his work and restored his sanity. He came here with his people and appreciated me. He just celebrated his birthday and came here and gave me money. I healed so many of them like that but his own is perculiar to me because, he is an only son of a family.\n\nWHY ARE YOU BEING ASSOCIATED WITH OKITANKWU RIVER, CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT THE RIVER IS KNOWN FOR SOME MYSTERIES, WHY ANSWERING, EZE NWANYI OKITANKWU ?\n\nOkitankwu visits me. Okitankwu gave this name - Eze Nwanyi Okitankwu to me. Am spiritually betrothed to Okitankwu. Be it known to you, that Okitankwu is me and am Okitankwu in the human form, I cannot do anything without consulting Okitankwu and getting his directives. I got to know about this, being a person the spirit communicates. My ancestors visits me and I sees them, we talk and discuss crucial issues and solutions. They send me errands, and give me messages. Something happened to me years back, that prompted me to run to Cheribum and Seraphim Church in Owerri for spiritual cleansing, deliverance and protection. I never wanted to answer this spiritual calling, because I was religiously inclined. On that fateful day, after the spiritual exorcism, I came back home. Something spectacular happened to me in the night, Okitankwu visited me in a form of a man and told me point blank that, am his wife and I cannot run away from him. He beat me up and stripped me naked. Several circumstances have shown that, I am deeply attached to Okitankwu and I know it's true.\n\nARE YOU SAYING THAT ALL THESE HEALINGS, PREDICTIONS, FORETELLING THE FUTURE, SPIRITUAL CLEANSING AND SOLUTIONS ETC, YOU DID NOT LEARN IT FROM ANY BODY OR INSTITUTION ?\n\nEmphatically, yes. Anything I know and practice today, I was not taught by any body. All the leaves, roots and spiritual materials I use are directives from Okitankwu. The truth that when good native doctors see me, they always bow in respect. They call me Agbarusia Ngele, Ekuru Ngele Nuoo ( the river that goes and returns) and the woman of the confluence. I can sincerely say that am attached to the name Eze Nwanyi Okitankwu because of choice. I hold an ofo, (an authority). My first ofo as a native doctor is crooked, it's not straight, it shows am the river and the land, I holds ofo of two rivers, flowing together as joint, one is Okitankwu and the other is Onukwu, each river that flows across a place, has its own name according to the ancestors, so I hold a crooked ofo which is not straight and it's the first ofo, I ever held in my life.\n\nAS A YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL LADY DOING THESE SPIRITUAL WORKS, ARE YOU NOT WORRIED THAT SOME PEOPLE SEES IT AS FETISH, IDOLATRY AND BARBARIC, MORESO, IT CONTRAVENES THE ETHICS AND PRINCIPLES OF CHRISTIANITY, WHAT THEN IS YOUR TAKE ON THE SOCIETAL IMPRESSIONS, CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT YOU ARE OPERATING IN A CHRISTIAN ENVIRONMENT?\n\nIt's only a misconception from ignorance. Spirituality has nothing to do with fetishness. Is because it's happening in Nigeria, African continent ? If I belong to any of the western world, people will give my activities perceived positive interpretations and visibility. The truth is that saving life is a spiritual gift, is not fetish. It can happen to any body. Spirituality, is who you are before you are a physical being. It does not matter what you believe upon, it's a product of knowing what you want and knowing who you're. First of all, am human, I believe in humanity. Am divinely prepared to help build and restore humanity. Life is a product of believe, whatever you believes upon and it works for you, to me, it's fine. The Chinese, the Hinduists, the Catholics etc, anything you do and works for you, is spirituality and not fetish, the word fetish is colonial and imperialistic abuse of Africans by Western adventurists. Am not against any persons believe system, after all, believe is a product of environmental exposure and understanding. When I started initially, it was a tug of war. Everything in life fought against me, but the universe insisted I must do the clarion call. I have to sacrifice everything that I was, just to accept the divine calling.\n\nARE YOU SAYING YOU BATTLED CHALLENGES, ABINITIO ? WHAT WERE THE CHALLENGES ? WHERE THE CHALLENGES SPIRITUAL OR PHYSICAL OR MAN MADE ? 4 YEARS AFTER, ARE YOU STILL FACING THOSE CHALLENGES OR WHAT ?\n\nYes, when I started, my first challenge was my mum, I remember in one occasion, I celebrated her birthday and bought gift for her, she rejected my honest gift, simply because she does not understand me and moreso, she was avoiding getting castigated and ostracized by her church and the community. However, she had a rethink of my relationship with her, after some people started coming to her, testifying of how God used me to solve one spiritual problem or the other for them. She then recalled the mystics behind my birth. Besides, there was serious family and community conspiracy against me, on the ground that what am doing is unchristian and it's not from God. Reverend Fathers and lots of people who claimed to be men of God, came down here and were fighting me to stop what I was doing, they severally threatened to burn down my shrine. The forces then was too much, but because the Gods destined and directs my foot steps, I came out victorious from all their attacks. They insulted and assaulted me, I was dehumanized, abused and excommunicated. I suffered serious societal neglects and rejections, but at last, they were all convinced that God's hands are upon my spiritual works. I love humanity and am serving humanity. I thank the universe for who I am today, I have helped humanity so much and am still helping humanity. Am grateful that the world is celebrating me as an authentic instrument being used to solve humanity numerous spiritual and physical problems.\n\nBASED ON THESE CHALLENGES, DO YOU HAVE ANY REGRET OR REGRETS ?\n\nYes, the first regret I have, is that I mysteriously lost five of my sons. I gave birth to 5 sons and they all mysteriously died as I resisted to answer the clarion call. So as of today, I have no male child, I only have two daughters, the second regrets I have, is that I lost my marriage in the course of this spiritual works and since then, I don't have any steady relationship, I was stripped off every thing that makes me happy because of my initial dogged reluctance to accept the divine spiritual works, through which am helping humanity, but today relationship wise, I wouldn't honestly say it's bad, men and women are attracted to me, it's my choice to make and the ball is in my court and I caught the shots, but for my boys they cannot come back again, may be some time some day, I will have a boy as I already have two girls.\n\nWHAT IS YOUR ADVISE TO OUR AFRICAN SOCIETY, ESPECIALLY NDIGBO ?\n\nTo our African brothers and sisters, it's important for them to know that, spirituality is part of our cultural heritages. It's an obvious truth that civilization started in Africa, Africans are not religious, we are spiritual people. There's a wide gap between spirituality and religion, every African believes in Ofo na Ogu, live and let me live, do to others what you would like others to do unto you. He who comes to equity must come with clean hands. These are African believes and characteristics. They're whom we are. Civilization started with us. Africans were the first to lit fire with stones. We're the first people on earth to practice astral travels and movements. We foresees and fore tells the future, the white men came, only to give us bibles and guns, they don't have sense. Time shall come when I will invoke and invite spirits into their houses and homes. I will launch a revenge. I am the wind that can not be entrapped by trap. If they can have the spiritual power to build telecommunications and to challenge me with the mobile phone at their disposal. What happens when we begin to go cyphy. The world is going cyphy soon.\n\nWe're the powers that be, we must come back to our root. White men have deceived us enough, as Africans, we have a lot to offer to the world, we have been ridiculed enough, let us come back to our good cultural and traditional heritages. We have to come back to our Agwus and Ndi ichies. These are who we are. The universe gave us as a race, our own distinct cultures and traditions, and that is who we are, anything outside Africa is foreign, alien and borrowed, therefore doesn't represent whom we are. Africans, Ndigbo must go back to their roots so as to have peace, stability, unity of purpose and progress. This is the truth that is constant like the Northern stars.\n\nTO YOU, HAVE YOU NOT APPRECIATED THE IMPACTS OF CHRISTIANITY AND ISLAMIC RELIGIONS IN OUR SOCIETY, AT LEAST IN TANDEM WITH THE DEMANDS OF THE 21st CENTURY ?\n\nReligion is a product of indoctrination, it's a gospel truth that every indoctrination is borrowed, it's not indigenous nor original with the people. It's totally alien and suited for a particular purpose. My brother, men needs to be wise. We're spiritual people. In Africa, in Nigeria, in Igboland before the coming of the white men, does it mean we don't have ways of seeing and foretelling things? Does it mean, we don't have an indigenous ways of solving spiritual problems and healing the sick ? Is it not stupidity to accept that another man's culture is superior to yours ?. Since the advent of white men with Christianity, have our lives not being shortened? If the white man God's are superior to ours, why are they interested in taking our God's to their lands ? Why are they adoring our God's by worshipping and making sacrifices to them? . Why are they dropping the Bible and Christianity ? They have redirected our brains. They have shortened our live spans by indoctrinating us with things that are alien to our being. These are gospel truth and our ancestors and the Gods of the land are aggrieved with us. Definitely, the world is not getting any better for us since the white man indoctrination, all we have are conflicts, religious crisis and factionalization, socioeconomic woes, disunity, injustice and global troubles etc. Religion is not all round evil but an ease tool of manipulating the people. It's a social system of slavery, and white men understands this better. They used the bible and Christianity to rape and destroy Africans, especially Ndigbo that are naturally gifted both in spirituality and technology.\n\nCONCERNING YOUR CONCEPTS OF SPIRITUALITY, AND WHAT IS GOING ON IN SOCIAL MEDIA, CAN SPIRITUAL WORKS BE LEARN AS A VOCATION OR IS IT ALWAYS ENDOWNED IN PERSON OR PERSONS ?\n\nMany are called but few are choosing. We're naturally gifted with intelligence to understand what's real or fake. For me, all am doing no body taught me, it's the spirits and the ancestors that directs me. You can be vocationally involved in spirituality but make sure you are called and be willing to strictly adhere and obey the rules, laws and principles associated with spiritual works. However, many good native doctors are naturally endowned from birth, they're unusual beings. They are neither expensive nor exploitative because they are always spiritually guided or directed by the beings of the universe. They works within the tenets of ofo na Ogu (that's God of karma, nemesis and retributive justice). They understands the implications of every falsehood and misrepresentations.\n\nCAN'T WE AFRICANS , NDIGBO IN PARTICULAR HOLD THE WHITE MEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DESCRETION OF OUR SPIRITUALITY ?\n\nWe did ourselves. Man is the architect of his or her own destiny. It's due to our wayo, or perceived number 6 sense or comprehensive idea, according to my late daddy, what have we used our own Ofo na Ogu to achieve. We must leave the white men alone and come back to our root. Wise men and countries are going back to their cultural and traditional heritages, and that's the way out.\n\nARE YOU THEN SAYING THAT THE WHITE MEN DID NOT DO ANYTHING TOWARDS BASTARDIZATION OF OUR CULTURAL HERITAGES ?\n\nWhich white man ? We're the one doing ourselves.\n\nWHAT OF THE CHRISTIANITY THEY BROUGHT TO US AS A SUPERIOR RELIGION AND INSTIGATED CONFLICTS AMONG US ?\n\nWhich religion ? If you don't accept it, will they kill you ?\n\nBUT WHEN SOME OF OUR FORE FATHERS REJECTED THEIR CHRISTIANITY RELIGION, THEY USED FORCES ON THEM ?\n\nOkay, now are they using force on you ? Now that you have realized their antics, what have you done ? Somebody that gave you bible and gun, you, you have no mind or sense to know what's good or bad or to decide what you want or need ? African man is a proud and strong being, thus they foresees these and thus why they gave us this and that. It's not yet late for us to come back to our roots. We have been deceived and raped enough. It's important we make a u-turn to our roots. That's the only way there will be peace, unity and progress in Africa, Nigeria and among Ndigbo.\n\nAM SO PERTURBED SEEING AND HEARING PEOPLE CALLING YOU EZE NWANYI POUNDS AND DOLLARS, MORESO IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT, ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE SITE OF YOUR SHRINE, MONEY BOTH FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND NAIRA ARE LITTERED HERE AND THERE, WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANT OF THIS ?\n\nThe work I do gives me money. Am glad to tell you am blessed. When you have money, you don't even have the time to think or talk about spiritual husband or wife. People needs to be healed and restored, have you ever stop to think, why should spiritual husband and wife mainly disturbs poor people ?\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ABOUT POVERTY AND SECRETS OF LONGETIVITY ?\n\nPoverty is a curse. Have you ever asked yourself, why do we have to die before we go to heaven ? Why do we have to take vaccines ? How and why do our forefathers lived long and prospered without these things including vaccines ? What happened to our vegetables , fruits and herbs ? What is wrong in a man marrying 4 wives? What happened to polygamy which is African and indigenous ? What happened to submission and true love ? What happened to family co-habitation and mut\n\n, I will only celebrates Amadioha. We must come back home and shine our eyes. Some of these, are man made biblical fallacies. The Europeans, Asians, Americans, Indians, Caribbeans etc celebrates annually their ancestral cultural heritages and festivals unadulterated,up to tomorrow. Africans ! What happened to us ? Who deceived us ? Of what use betraying our own ancestors? The time to wise up is now. Things must be done in our ways because we're unique and distinct people. When there was no computers and internets, how do our forefathers precisely know who killed Amadi at the age of 10 ? Even with the advents of vaccines, why do we still have high rates of mortality and sicknesses, compared with the olden days ? Why ? .\n\nIN RECENT TIMES, THERE HAVE BEEN CLAMOUR TO CUT DOWN OR SET ON FIRE ANCESTRAL FORESTS AND TREES, IN THE NAME OF DESTROYING INIMICAL ANCESTRAL GOD'S AND SPIRITS, AS A HUMANIST, DOES THESE PERTURBS DANGER ?\n\nWe're here burning our bushes and trees in the name of destroying idols, unknown to us, we're creating environmental hazards by increasing the rates of carbon dioxide at the expense of production of the oxygen we breathe to live and live long. The cutting of trees and burning of bushes are detrimental to human health, and in total defiance to our ancestors respect to trees, forests, herbs and bushes. Because of the persistent destruction of our ecosystem, lives now are shortened. Who therefore is fooling who ? As things are today, we don't even know if we are going to be clone, in accordance with Artificial Intelligence, AI operations . Anything can happen to humanity tomorrow, who knows but one thing that's certain, every race are endowed by the universe with their distinct ways of living. Am a humanist, I believe in saving life first. I don't believe in religion. I don't even believe in tradition. I totally believed in humanity.\n\nWe have abused our ecosystem, destroying trees and plants that are medicinal in pursuit of development and not replacing same. It's easier when we understand our own. Am strong and deep rooted with what am doing, it's unfair to tell me that your own is superior to my own.\n\nSINCE YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN TRADITION, WHAT KIND OF NATIVE DOCTOR OR SPIRITUALIST ARE YOU ?\n\nAm a native doctor who is scienctifically inclined. Mgbe obula Nwoke na nwanyi di na,(whenever a man and a woman makes love), spermatozoa nwoke abaa na ime nwanyi,(the man's sperm enters the woman ovary) and there was an egg that formed a child, that's it, ihe owula unu kaa ga agbasaghi m (whatever you people are talking does not concern me). Ihe m kaga wu, amula nwa, nwaa oga erinini ? (What am saying is that, a child has been born, what will the child eat ?) Nye nu unu ya akamu, inyee ya akamu, ga ana aju ma nwaa osii olee luo uwa (you did not give him or her food, you are only interested in who reincarnated him or her). Ijuu ga nne ya ka ijuu ga nwa luro uwa ? ( Are you asking the mother or the new born baby). Nga nwa shiri luo uwa ya hiri (however, a child reincarnated, let him or she lives). I don't discriminate, when it comes to serving humanity. In terms of treatment, I treat people with equal respect and love. This is also who I am.\n\nCAN WE HAVE AN INSIGHT INTO YOUR RECENT SPIRITUAL TESTIMONIAL WORK (s) ?\n\nThere was an incident that happened some months ago, a lady by name Uzoamaka from Uzoagba-Ikeduru, in Imo State was diagnosed for kidney problem and arrangements have been perfected to take her to India for the kidney transplant. Somebody told them about me and they consulted me, during which I made a declaration and told her that as far as she's from Imo State, she's not going anywhere for transplant, why must her kidney be transplanted ? First of all, why was she sick ? Through divinity, I found out that she's a victim of an oath she took in her first generation life, and I re-directed the oath and case closed. Today, Uzoamaka is still hale and hearty. Her kidney is 100% functioning optimally. It's just a product of few commands and spiritual appeasements here and there. Just like also a woman who was pregnant and the hospital recommended her for Caesarian operation, she was referred to me by people who have attested to my spiritual prowess, just by mere ministering the relevant herbs, she had safe delivery.In life, every body has a calling, don't be envious or jealous of each other's calling. Discover your calling and work towards that and be concerned with helping or serving humanity.\n\nFROM THE WAYS AND MANNERS YOU TALK, IT SEEMS TO ME YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD ALMIGHTY AND HIS SON JESUS CHRIST, WHO DIED FOR THE REDEMPTION OF MANKIND ?\n\nDefinitely, we have our ways and means we connect to the universe and achieve the needed results for humanity. Honestly, am yet to be convinced that God has a son and the begotten son was sacrificed to crucification death for the seek of saving humanity for an eternal life. Save from what ? Noooo !!! This is heresy from the pit of hell. What happened to goats and fowls ?. I can use the blood of goat and fowl to achieve my spiritual purpose rather than using the blood of an only son. It's a mere, theological falsehood. Snakes don't talk.\n\nBUT EARLIER, YOU HAVE TOLD US YOU WERE A MEMBER OF SEVEN DAYS ADVENTIST CHURCH ?\n\nYes oooo !!! Very religiously inclined. But don't go there oooo !!!!\n\nI didn't abandoned it quickly. I believed until I died and went to the mortuary and came back a life.\n\nHAVE YOU DIED BEFORE ?\n\nYes !. Is this not my mother sitting there, go and ask her whether I have died before or not ?.\n\nEZE NWANYI OKITANKWU, YOU ARE REVEALING ANOTHER MYSTERY OF YOURSELF, WHAT HAPPENED ?\n\nYes indeed. You have not seen or read it in my pages and X-handle. Am in so many blogs, it's no longer news that I have died and taken to mortuary and I regained consciousness after some hours. I was pregnant, I told my mum, I will give birth on April 29th 2017, I will die that day and I will be send to the morgue, but I will wake up from the morgue, but one thing I don't know is when and how.\n\nYOU TOLD YOUR MOTHER BEFORE IT HAPPENED ?\n\nYes anything that happens or will happen in my life, I tell my mum before hand. She is there, just go and ask her for confirmation or not.( the mother confirmed same and other mysteries associated to her first daughter). Anything happening in my life is always foretold and I tell people very closed to me like my mother and beloved dad, when he was alive. The doctor said my expected date of delivery was 6th of April 2017 but I told my mum that I will give birth to a baby girl and that she will be the last girl in my womb, and any other delivery might be boy, but my problem then is not given birth to the girl but that the girl will come on the 29th of April, 2017 as against the doctors expected date of delivery, and I will die on that day and they will send me to the morgue. I instructed that on no account should they inject anything on my body. I will surely wake up but I don't know when. On the 29th of April, 2017 did I not die?\n\nWHICH HOSPITAL DID THIS HAPPENED ?\n\nBand Specialist Hospital, World Bank Umuguma, Owerri West in Imo State Nigeria.\n\nWHEN ACTUALLY DID YOU TURNED INTO PROFESSIONAL SPIRITUAL WORK ?\n\nIt was after I resurrected from death that I started, but before then, I used to do candle works. It was immediately I took the four ofo's as mantle of authority which you saw in my shrine and that was 2020.\n\nAPART FROM YOUR SPIRITUAL ESCAPADES, HOW ELSE WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE REMEMBERED ?\n\nAm a humanist. In all I do, I put the people first before I put myself. I loved to be remembered for taking care of sick children, mentally disordered people. I loved to be remembered for loving men, men are good, most men are trust worthy and confidential. Mostly, I wished to be remembered as a person who loves taking care of elderly men and women, most especially the less privileged and the poorest of the poor. I equally loved to be appreciated for not faulting my dad in all his failures. I also loved to be remembered for being truthful, sincere and kind to people. I wished to be remembered for making impacts in the lives of men through healing,"

        "content": "Filmmaker Jayan K Cherian; stills from his latest film 'Rhythm of Dammam', on the Siddi Community of Yellapur in Uttara Kannada (north Karnataka).\n\nThe stunningly shot and evocative Rhythm of Dammam, in Siddi Bhasha, is the first fictional feature ever to be made on the Indian Siddi community that traces its ancestry to Africa. In the film, the pre-teen Jayaram, who lives in Karnataka's Yellapura, is afflicted by his dead grandfather's visions, as his impoverished family fights over supposed buried treasure. But Jayaram is a chosen one, the visitations will lead him to discover his community's origin and sea-bound journey to India centuries ago, as slaves, and their continued oppression by upper-caste landowners.\n\nBorn in small-town Kerala, New York-based filmmaker Jayan K Cherian's first brush with race happened in the US where he went for higher studies. \"All of a sudden, in America, I became a nigger, a black man, an accented Indian, a brown-skin guy. White people -- albeit not all -- have their prejudices and stereotypes, they put you in a bracket of what you look like. And it is cyclical. In 1555, the Roman Catholic Church burned the epics of the Aztecs and started the Mexican Inquisition, some years later, the Portuguese started the Inquisition in Goa, ruled by Bishop Menezes, this is recent history. Xenophobia is always present, in all communities and across classes. And we [Indians] have our own baggage, too. When I'd talk about racism, oppression, xenophobia, homophobia and gender oppression, my White friends would interject: 'You people are caste oppressors',\" says the 58-year-old filmmaker whose latest film Rhythm of Dammam premiered at the just-concluded 55th International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa, and is one of the only two Indian films in the International competition segment of the 29th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK), from December 13-20.\n\nIn the first segment of a two-part interview, Cherian, who stayed with the community in Yellapur over five years since 2016-17, talks about the Siddi community and the making of the film. Edited excerpts:\n\nA still from 'Rhythm Of Dammam'.\n\nDid your own brushes with racism in the US trigger an ethnological interest in race and in training the lens on the group of African Indians -- the Siddi community?\n\nDuring college in America, and in New York City, I've been watching the Black Power movement, following African literature, from Amiri Baraka to Maya Angelou, and different social, literary and poetic movements. At the time, I was interested in Indian people who came from Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana and Suriname. Their forefathers were indentured servants in indigo plantations and opium factories, who were brought by the British. You can see that people's flow in Amitav Ghosh's book (Sea of Poppies, 2008). The indentured servants flow to Africa, Europe and Latin America. But that is not really migration. That is human trafficking. Most of these Hindu workers were offered jobs in Kolkata and put in ships that landed in Latin America. That started in 1835, during the time, the British queen was banning slavery in the colonies. So, they wanted to replace the slaves with indentured servants. The French were the first to draft a treaty (French Treaty of Commerce of 1860). But even when the British abolished slavery in 1835, slave trade continued in Portuguese Goa and ended there only in 1865. I stumbled upon an article in the British Library on the huge slave flow from Africa to India. The Siddi community [descendants of the Bantu tribe of East Africa] is spread all over Asia: India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and more. The Siddi community in Pakistan are Islamised and dissolved into the population. But in India, there's a huge, solid and layered history, as there's different levels of African presence.\n\nTell us more...\n\nIn Deccan, for more than 600 years, the dominant power was [wielded by] African mercenaries, they are called the Moors [North African Muslims]. They were the kings and generals. In north India, Razia Sultan's trusted soldier was Jamal-ud-din Yaqut, who was African [an Abyssinian slave]. Later, in the 1500s, a dominant, colossal figure in Deccan was Malik Ambar [served as Peshwa of Ahmadnagar], who was born in Ethiopia, with the name Chapu. He was sold as a little boy in a slave market in Baghdad and was bought by a Gujarati merchant and brought to Ahmadnagar. A brilliant warrior, who became the army chief, he defeated the Mughals and Jahangir hated him. The Hyderabad Nizam have Siddi warriors recruited into his force. That is different kind of Siddis. Then we come to the Siddis [in the Konkan region], the chattel slaves bought from the nomadic Bantu tribes of Africa. They were captured by Arab slave catchers, brought to Mozambique port and exported through the Spaniard and Portuguese ships. Most of the Portuguese ships would anchor in Goa. The captain of the ship, an Arab, was named Syed [meaning noble man/master]. And the root for the word Siddi comes from the word Syedi, meaning the property of Syed. In Pakistan, they are called Sheedi.\n\nA still from 'Rhythm Of Dammam'.\n\nSo, the Siddis in the Konkan belt are former slaves?\n\nSlavery continued in Portuguese Goa, as the rich native landlords brought them as manual labours, to work the fields, but also as entertainers, musicians, and sexual objects. There is a very interesting study about the Yellapura [in Karnataka] area. Around 46 per cent of genetic pool (converted within two-three generations) comes from the Brahmin landlords, for over 150 years. This is a crazy number. There are different Siddi groups in India. Gujarati Siddis are predominantly Muslim Siddis. They have a greater connection to Africa because of trade relations and speak a Gujarati creole, but are still marginalised in the Gir forest. In Uttara Kannada (north Karnataka), there's a peculiar history. In the 1840s, the Portuguese Goan Catholics started court of inquisitions. The Goan inquisition forced local landlords, majorly Brahmins, to convert to Christianity or give up their properties (including slaves). The missionary Francis Xavier, who despised Hindu religion and called it pagan practice, aggressively converted a lot of poor fishermen. The inquisitors would monitor if anyone practised Hindu rites, they would trial and burn them. That's why the Gowda Saraswat Brahmins ran away to Mangalore (Karnataka) and Cochin (Kerala). A lot of slaves, too, escaped to the Konkan forests. In the next wave, the great plague of Goa [Chorão Epidemic] meant a lot of slave dens were unattended, so more slaves escaped into the forests. In 1865, when the King of Portugal officially banned slavery, the remaining liberated slaves joined the others in the Konkan forest and started their own communes, tamed the wild and cultivated their own food, like in Brazil or the Maroons (African descendants) in the swamps of North Carolina. The Uttara Kannada district landlords, the Brahmin Hegde and Hebbar, got them to clear the forest land and make it arable, thereby re-enslaving them, with intergenerational debts, like farmers anywhere else in India. All the sugarcane and areca plantations in the Konkan belt owned by Brahmins have been cleared/cultivated by the Siddis. In that process, these former slaves were converted as Hindu.\n\nThey are a very unique population. Hindu Siddis are found only in the Konkan region, nowhere else in the world. The former slaves imitated the Brahmins [Bhat/Bhatt] and their rituals. The Siddis adopted Hindu names like: Jairam, Yashoda, Ganapati. Slaves who worked for Christian landlords were converted to Christianity. Chattel slaves were bought by Bijapur Sultan, too, and converted into Muslims. You will find them all in the Konkan region and in the same families, there will be a Christian, a Hindu and a Muslim member. My Siddi friend's great grandfather was originally Qasim who was bought and sold in Goa to the Portuguese who changed his name to Bastu (Portuguese for Sebastian) and, later, his Brahmin landlord renamed him as Ganapati.\n\nAmong the Siddis, the Hindu Siddi community is the most backward. The church helps the Christian Siddis to access education and jobs. The first Hindu Siddi to have graduated from the community is Shantaram Siddi, who's the Karnataka MLC, and he joined the RSS-affiliated Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram. He makes a cameo in Rhythm of Dammam.\n\nThe language of the film has both Konkani and Kannada. Is Siddi Bhasha a mix of both?\n\nIn Yellapur, you can see the people speaking Marathi, Konkani, Siddi Bhasha and several others. There is cultural intersectionality because this place is on the border. And Siddi Bhasha is actually Konkani Kannada with a lot of Sanskrit words in it, because of the Brahmin landlords, since the Hindu Siddis don't have any interaction with outside people. They imitate the Brahmins. Their marriage parties have vegetarian menu and are catered by Brahmins, because the landlords won't eat at their marriage parties if the Siddis cook. And the Brahmins won't sit and eat with the Siddis. They have a special area to eat.\n\nA still from 'Rhythm Of Dammam'.\n\nThe film starts with the grandfather's death, Hindu death rituals like Shraadh and Pitru Aradhana are shown. Like gods, their ancestors are shown to have a special place in their homes.\n\nThey have a room for their [dead] elders. These ancestors have a continuous presence in their life. For every family decision and event (marriage, funerals), they go talk to them. One person in the family is an oracle, who speaks to the ancestors. That connects them to Bantu people and African tradition. Besides the ancestor worship and the Dammam music, connecting the Siddis to the African Bantus. Their original religion, language and everything taken away from them, they are only left with their music and their Dammam, a small drum. It is this music which brings all Siddis, across religions, to come together, at an annual carnival (in the first week of April), where they jointly worship Siddinaas and dance to the music of Dammam, as if from a muscle memory, an intergenerational memory. This music is used for celebration, mourning, speaking to ancestors, as well as a healing tool. Rhythm of Damam is celebration of their spirit.\n\nIt was a prolonged sequence in the film, the rituals followed by the dance. Was it an aesthetic call to shoot it in one long take?\n\nThey start at 6 am and end at 6 am the next day, 24 hours of rituals, and they start to dance by evening until next day morning. That's why the lingering length of that shot [in the film]. The long episodal dance comes in waves, they are in a shamanic trance, going back to their tribal roots. The camera kept rolling, I couldn't cut. It was a challenge to shoot. Two Dammams take place and the entire film is shaped in between the two. One is the barah din or twelfth day ceremony [after the elder's death] and the other is the healing ceremony of the boy Jayaram. That is his initiation, as he puts on the face paint. He rejected this outer world or this conditioning. That is their resistance. A kind of coming-of-age declaration, as he starts to play the Dammam.\n\nA still from 'Rhythm Of Dammam'.\n\nIn his dream, Jayaram sees his now-dead grandfather and ancestors because of the muscle memory that connects the Siddis to their cultural roots in Africa?\n\nYeah. But there is some other psychiatric twist into that. There is an African American psychiatrist by the name Dr Joy DeGruy and she had a diagnosis. She wrote a book called Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome, where she addressed why the males in present-day African American community is drawn to more criminality, addiction and laziness, and all kind of traumatic symptoms. She found this psychiatric disorder as a syndrome stemming from the intergenerational slave trauma. I drew that material from her work and uses it as a tool to tell the past of the boy. The boy grows out of his innocence, talks about his African past with pride, the magical elements from the grandfather, his uncle mentions a black panther god and the Bantu chief in Africa. But his cousin, who's a rapper and is quite profane, debunks these stories to tell the boy that, 'We [the later descendants] are just slaves. [Our forefathers] were put on a boat and sold in the market.' That's the trigger for Jayaram, who looks at the murals and pictures of slavery [mounted on the wall of the uncle's house]. This kind of dissonance creates some kind of psychiatric effect on him. The visions, delusions and flashbacks he gets of his dead grandfather is a muscle memory. Delusion is part of the psychosis. Post-traumatic slave syndrome is a real diagnosis. I use it as a storytelling vehicle to connect all these things in my film.\n\nTell us about the cast. Are they all non-actors?\n\nThe old man, the grandfather figure, Parasuram Siddi, is around 80 years old. He was one of the pioneer theatre persons from that community. And his two daughters are professional actors. One is Girija Siddi, who went to NSD (National School of Drama), where she teaches. She plays Jayaram's mother in the film. Prashant Siddi, the father of the boy, is a prominent Kannada actor. He's done more than 50 films. The Havyaka Brahmin landlord, KG Krishnamurthy, is also a prominent Kannada actor. But majority of the people are non-professional actors. However, every Siddi person has a very high artistic propensity, it's in their blood.\n\nA still from 'Rhythm Of Dammam'.\n\nWhich ethnographic filmmakers have inspired you?\n\nEthnography is an anthropological term, is an orientalist Western word. Many ethnographers study the tribal people. Many documentary films do the same, too. Earlier films like Nanook of the North (1922; world's first documentary film) show the White man exoticising the eskimoes. That is the history of ethnography. So, the word is problematic. I'm just not documenting them like documentaries do. I take a fictional narrative and superimpose on that the cultural and historical aspects, using documentary subjects in a fictional space. My specialty is blurring the borders of the genres.\n\nIn filmmakers' pantheon, we have gods such as Marcel Duchamp and Maya Deren who, in the 1940s, went to Haiti and spent years to document the Voudoun (or Voodoo) practice, the so-called black magic. That is the subaltern religion, which is oppressed people's religion, which they secretly practise in any former-slave communities. You can see the same in Yellapura, too. In Haiti, all Haitian people, former slaves, are Catholics. But behind the Catholic altar they worship the Virgin Mary, behind that there's a voodoo deity. People wrongly think voodoo is black magic. It is actually a fallen religion. It is an ancient African nature worship. Often the masters/oppressors (White men) are afraid of voodoo because they think these people practise it to kill the masters. That's what they fear.\n\nYou aren't a Dalit but you made Papilio Buddha (2013), you aren't a Siddi either. How do you respond to cultural appropriation?\n\nAs a filmmaker, I perceive film as a fine art and it is my primary medium of expression. When I'm telling a story, like in Rhythm of Dammam, it is not Siddi people's authentic story because I'm not Siddi but this is my representation of their reality and this is my story.\n\nI'm a diasporic person, and like Jayaram, in a certain sense, I'm displaced, too, albeit a privileged or willing displacement, but the Siddis exercise agency, too, through their rituals and the carnival -- it is the carnivalesque, borrowing (Russian literary critic-philosopher) Mikhail Bakhtin's coined word (whose playful spirit mocks/subverts authority/power and liberates the assumptions of the dominant).\n\nIn the film, I try to explore the spirit of the Siddi people, their imaginations and their myth. And I only focus on the intergenerational trauma of the human trafficking [slave trade] that happened centuries ago, and the present-day social, class and caste location of these people. For me, the politics of camera is itself intrinsically ethnographic. You are invading others' privacy. There is an invasion. It is a gun in a way. When we switch on a camera onto other people who become the subject, the camera is going to be the dominant symbol of power. I'm aware of the subject-power relationship very much.\n\nI'm looking for a distributor. I want to show this film. This film is my most benign film. I have no explicit content or anything. I love my work to reach people. I'm a very selfish. The only reason I chose to show it here (IFFI, Goa) is because of the Konkan people's proximity to this place. They saw the film for the first time. Next is IFFK. I'm actively looking for the distributors, OTTs, festival circuit and more. So, any distributor wants to have the film, please give my number (smiles)."

        "content": "This book will not please convinced Christians, but it will interest those who were believers and one day began to look at religion from a rational perspective. Or lovers of history in general. Catherine Nixey, a Welsh historian born in 1980, has dug into the documents that deal with the life of Jesus Christ, full of versions that are neither accommodating nor similar. Thus she has discovered traces of an arrogant man, feared by his parents, violent at times, who cursed children and impregnated his own mother. Or a charlatan, one of many who wandered the world healing the lame or blind, walking on water, and performing miracles that are repeated in many Mediterranean narratives of the era. The story of the virginity of Mary -- in whose vagina an incredulous woman who wanted to verify the miracle after the birth of the son of God burned her hand -- takes the cake. Everything has been collected in her new book Heresy, of which Nixey spoke in Madrid with EL PAÍS.\n\n-- After all this research, do you think you know Jesus Christ?\n\n-- No, does anyone know him? I think the more you read, the less you know. I grew up with this picture of Jesus, who had children around him and bunny rabbits and all of this. But if you read the Bible, you know there are nasty bits, that bit where Jesus says, I am not come to bring peace but a sword. The more you read, the more you realize this is a very complicated historical figure, who it is very hard to get to the bottom of. Partly because there are so many Christian versions: the Jesus who kills people, the Jesus who impregnates his own mother Mary, which actually makes sense in a sense, if you think about it. The Jesus who is angry, the Jesus who is vindictive. It is impossible to say who Jesus was. Christianity was not unique. It did not have one story. It was uniquely successful. And if you look at him as a historian you see a huge and fragmented and interesting picture, which to someone raised as a Catholic is a shock, but an interesting shock.\n\nNixey was raised in a very religious family. Her father was a friar and her mother had previously been a nun. As such, her first approach was from the faith, until she became a classical historian and worked on the documents of the time -- the authorized and unauthorized ones -- which have not been adopted by the Catholic Church: the Infancy Gospel of Thomas or the Infancy Gospel of James, for example, from which we have taken traditions such as the mule or the ox in the Christmas representation, but not the brutal abrasion of the hand of Salome when touching the hymen of the Virgin after childbirth.\n\nAnd she starts from an irrefutable fact: between the death of Christ and the first written accounts, 40 years had passed. \"He existed, he was a man, but we have no idea how many of the stories attributed to him are his or those of others. How many of these stories date from his time? How many of them are put on afterwards? The fossil record is very poor. The stories are so similar to ones that appear in other ancient texts, in novels, in magic spells. Forty years is a huge time for oral transmission. That's a big leap to go with nothing written down. So what happened in the stories in the meantime? They start to look very like all the other stories in the Mediterranean and stories that were written down before them. To ancient critics, he was a charlatan, another magician who performed tricks like so many of the time, perhaps not to get money, but possibly food and certainly respect.\"\n\nJesus' existence is indisputable, Nixey says, because \"he appears in many texts of the period, even in Latin sources such as the mentions of Nero collected by the Roman historian Suetonius. So many of these stories appear again and again and again in not only different versions in Christianity, but in similar different versions outside Christianity. But many also appear in the lives of others,\" such as Apollonius, to whom a similar biography is attributed.\n\nThe healing of a blind man, for example, is also attributed to Vespasian [9-79 AD, emperor from 69-79 AD] and is linked to a rumor about the arrival of \"two men who will come from the east who will rule over the world,\" Nixey recounts. \"And everybody in Rome thought this was Vespasian because he did rule over the world. But his story is similar to that told in the Gospels and also to that of Asclepius four centuries earlier: another son of a God, another person with healing hands, another person who can make the lame walk and the blind see.\" The past, she says, is full of people, not exactly Christian, who performed miracles in the markets, who parted waters, who resurrected the dead... \"The same stories recur again and again and again.\"\n\n-- Why then did Jesus Christ rise above all the others and become so important in our civilization?\n\n-- If we look for historical reasons, we have to go to Constantine [emperor from 306 to 337], he made the difference. Roman emperors have always adopted and promoted foreign and Eastern religions, religions came and went at that time. But Constantine adopts Christianity and lives a long time, he remains emperor for 30 years. His sons also have long lives. And one man who could have changed this, Julian, a later pagan emperor [361-363], lived a very short time. If that had changed, if Julian had lived to be 90 and Constantine had been emperor for three years instead of 30, we would not be having this conversation. Everything would have been different.\n\nThe nature of Christianity in helping people and contributing to their well-being played a big role in its consolidation. \"Definitely. They were proselytizing, so they were trying to convert people, which other religions weren't really trying to do in this period. And on the other hand, they were providing something that other religions weren't providing, they helped the needy, widows, orphans... Christianity did this from the beginning and did it well. They offered something that appealed to people at that time.\"\n\nThe Christian religion was then, says the historian, a kind of health service with a spiritual aura. \"And it is logical. Breaking your arm could be life-ending in this world. Life was very hard. We saw this in the pandemic, when everyone prayed more, even I have wanted to pray for my children.\"\n\nJesus Christ, Nixey believes, could never have imagined the impact of his life, which from the beginning sparked criticism from contemporary writers who did not understand what he said because it was \"cryptic, contradictory, sometimes violent.\" \"Even if you just take the Gospels, he's impossible to know. Ancient critics criticized things he said, and it's quite refreshing in a way to hear them criticize it, because they criticize it in the way that as a child, sitting in church, you hear these stories and you think, that makes no sense to me.\" She refers, for example, to the miracle of the men possessed by demons, whom Jesus freed from evil spirits, which in turn possessed pigs that killed themselves by throwing themselves off a cliff. \"This really bothered the ancients. Why is he putting them into the pigs? We think of Jesus as being much more clear-cut than in fact in the Bible he is, and certainly than he was to ancient readers.\"\n\nNixey notes that many of these things have been ignored for almost 2,000 years because theology -- and not history or mythology -- took charge of the Christian past. There were authors who had tried before to do what she has done now, such as William Hone or Edward Gibbon, but they were \"mercilessly attacked.\" \"If you are a believer, it is difficult to read the other texts and not feel offended or dismissed.\" Since the 20th century things have changed and texts such as the Protoevangelium of James, for example, are also used when studying Divinity. \"I wouldn't have wanted to necessarily read all this if I was in full Christian belief.\"\n\nThis is the text that fixes the donkey and the ox in the Christmas representation, not the Gospels. Pope Benedict's book Jesus of Nazareth: The Infancy Narratives, in fact, denies their presence in the manger of Bethlehem.\n\n-- Do you still put it up, the nativity scene at Christmas?\n\n-- Yes, I do! I have three children. We have a little wooden one that comes from Ethiopia I think, with Mary, the mule and the ox and all of that. We do it for them.\n\n-- By the way, where does the myth of Mary's virginity, which is also repeated across different times and cultures, come from?\n\n-- Who knows, but it appears again and again in Mediterranean cultures. Why? I don't know. This is not me as a historian talking. This is just me as a woman. In that period, people liked babies, but they didn't like women having sex. So it's like the best of both worlds."

        "content": "Advocates argue that psychedelic use as a spiritual practice should be protected under religious rights, sparking a legal and social debate.\n\nThe Psychedelic Healing Shack in Detroit, a center promoting spiritual healing with psilocybin mushrooms, is embroiled in a legal battle with the city following a raid in September 2024. The establishment was shut down after an undercover officer allegedly purchased psilocybin mushrooms from owner Robert \"Dr. Bob\" Pizzimenti. As Metro Times reported, despite the closure, Pizzimenti remains defiant, arguing that the use of mushrooms is a fundamental part of his religious practice.\n\nThe City's Legal Response\n\nIn the wake of the raid, Detroit authorities are firm in their stance, threatening to permanently close the Psychedelic Healing Shack unless Pizzimenti agrees to a consent agreement. \"It is against the law to sell marijuana without a license,\" said Conrad Mallett Jr., Detroit's corporation counsel. \"It is against the law to sell psychedelic mushrooms.\" The city claims that Pizzimenti attempted to hide behind religious freedoms to justify illegal activities, a position the city has historically challenged in similar cases.\n\nThe raid resulted in the seizure of 99 grams of psilocybin mushrooms and 10 grams of marijuana. Despite the city's actions, Pizzimenti insists that his business, part of his religious practices, is protected under the First Amendment, which guarantees the free exercise of religion.\n\nDefending Religious Freedom\n\nPizzimenti, a former chiropractor turned spiritual leader, has joined the Sugarleaf Church to bolster his legal defense. The church, founded in 2014, incorporates cannabis and psilocybin mushrooms as sacraments in its spiritual practices. Pizzimenti maintains that the mushrooms serve as a tool for healing, not recreation. \"I see lives change with these mushrooms,\" he says. \"They're non-addictive, and I wasn't doing it for the money.\"\n\nDr. Bob's argument centers around his belief that the right to use psychedelics as part of religious practices should be protected under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. He asserts that his actions are comparable to the use of wine in Christian communion or peyote in Native American ceremonies. \"It's our religious freedom to have these psychedelics,\" he tells Metro Times.\n\nControversial Legal Battle\n\nSugarleaf Church founder, Reverend Heidi Grossman-Lepp, has long advocated for the religious use of entheogens. She was arrested for marijuana-related charges, but the case ended in a hung jury. Grossman-Lepp has since defended over 27 criminal cases, using religious freedom as a key argument. She warned the city of a lawsuit if they continue targeting Pizzimenti, claiming their actions infringe on constitutional rights.\n\n\"The city's threats to conduct additional raids and orchestrate controlled buys within the temple blatantly violate his First Amendment right to freely exercise his religion without government interference,\" Grossman-Lepp wrote in a letter to the city.\n\nLegal And Social Debate\n\nThe Psychedelic Healing Shack case has highlighted the ongoing debate over the religious use of psychedelics in the U.S. In cities like Detroit, where psilocybin mushrooms have been decriminalized, authorities continue to target locations allegedly selling the substance, though no charges have been filed in some cases. Grossman-Lepp argues that the city should focus on more pressing issues, such as local crime, rather than targeting spiritual centers.\n\n\"We are not selling drugs; we're offering healing,\" Pizzimenti concludes. His defiance signals that the battle over religious freedoms and psychedelic use is far from over in Detroit.\n\nCover image made with AI\n\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs"

        "content": "God of War's Presumed Atreus Game Now Has the Perfect Excuse to Jump Ship with Its Title\n\nHearthstone's The Great Dark Beyond expansion is all about the Draenei race's tragic exile from Argus and their journey through space, and both the Draenei and the concept of space travel itself are represented strongly through the expansion's new game mechanics. A host of new Draenei minion cards express the race's hopefulness by leaning into forward-thinking interactions, while the Hearthstone expansion's starship mechanic sees players combining cards to assemble powerful class-specific starships.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nGame Rant sat down with Hearthstone senior game designer Leo Robles Gonzalez and senior VFX artist Luke Mason to discuss the latest expansion's development process. They weighed in on the importance of creating Draenei cards that authentically reflected the race's identity, how they designed spacecraft without leaning too heavily into sci-fi, and how the new cards fit into Hearthstone decks of various playstyles. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nRelated\n\nHearthstone is Crossing Over With StarCraft\n\nStarCraft is colliding with Hearthstone in a big way, with characters, units, and powers from the RTS game coming to the collectible card game soon.\n\nHow Hearthstone Expresses Draenei Identity Through Cards\n\nQ: The Great Dark Beyond is focused on the Draenei exile into the stars. Can you talk about how that idea initially took shape? What were the early discussions like for this expansion?\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nGonzalez: Thinking way back, before we actually started doing any design work on the set, when we were just picking what the theme was, we have a whole -- not really a system, but there's a bunch of stuff that goes into picking the theme we're going with.\n\nOne of the things we really try to pay attention to is listening to our players, doing some surveys, and testing a bunch of different basic ideas to see what sticks. So, there were a couple ideas that were within the umbrella of the Great Dark Beyond, testing general things like, \"Let's go to space, let's go to the moon, let's fight some demons.\"\n\nWe just got little bits from a bunch of different things and thought, \"Oh yeah. This is really cool. Players really like this, this, and this,\" and found the throughline to connect all of that, which is the Great Dark Beyond -- the story of the Draenei getting betrayed by Kil'jaeden and Archimonde, and some of them joining the Burning Legion. Boom, Argus basically gets decimated, so they leave and try to find a new home.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nI think the thing that I really wanted to make clear with this expansion is that the Draenei's journey through space -- the periods between Argus and Draenor, and then Draenor and Azeroth -- that's just not really defined in any Warcraft content out there. It's just, \"Oh, and then they traveled for thousands of years, and then they landed, and then they traveled for thousands of years and landed.\" I really wanted this set to be a window into what might have happened in that time.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nSome of our players are familiar with what happened on Argus, Draenor, and Azeroth. Some of our players aren't, which is why you see some iconic, important characters to those storylines present in the set, but I really wanted this to be a window into what space looks like in Warcraft.\n\nMason: One thing that, from a visual standpoint, is really fun is, since we're focusing so much on the Draenei, you get to see so many different roles that each of them could be taking on. The classes explore that even further. With the Shamans being the sort of navigators like Farseer Nobundo, you have the Mage class doing a lot of the Arcanite crystal magic. You have the Vindicators across Warrior, and all these different examples. You just kind of get the base Draenei fantasy, but it really is that sort of, \"Then there's a bit more, and then there's a bit more,\" that's reflected in the starships they use across the galaxies. It was a very fun, exploratory thing to double down and fill in any gaps.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nQ: The Draenei are a unique race with a strong identity. How did you approach expressing those characteristics in Hearthstone?\n\nGonzalez: The best way to talk about that is with the Draenei minion type. It's a brand new minion type that we're adding in this set and I think, trying to figure out where to talk about what we shipped or where it started -- I want to talk about both. I'm kind of freaking out about the pacing of it.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nI think with any minion type that we make, there are a lot of different things we have to consider and check boxes for. Minion types are things that, thinking for the future, we can see being relevant. I think Undead is a great example; no matter where we are, Undead are going to be present just because they're all over the place in Warcraft fantasy. I think with Draenei, that box is checked because they're a pretty well-known and well-loved playable race from WoW. Additionally, what does a specific minion type bring to the table that we don't already have at our disposal with other minion types?\n\nThinking back, Naga were an amazing example of that -- the first minion type to be super spell-focused. So with Draenei, the way we landed on the minion type was not by setting out specifically to make Draenei a minion type. We knew Draenei were going to be core to the expansion, but through testing a bunch of different mechanics, we tried these minions that were themed around the Zodiac.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nOne example was the Celestial Bull, which had a Battlecry: \"The next Celestial Bull you play gains blank.\" We tested that, and it was like, \"Oh, this is really fun.\" One of the designers I work with was like, \"I want to see this pushed further and made bigger,\" so we thought, let's do it as a minion type. What minion type should we use? Draenei -- it fits perfectly.\n\nThematically, the Draenei are incredibly hopeful. Not even just from a literal standpoint -- their story is so tragic. Their home planet is torn asunder, they're traveling through space with no goal in sight, just trying to survive and find a new home. But also, their connection to the Holy Light and the Naaru gives this feeling of sanctity and security. The gameplay mechanic of \"Battlecry: The next Draenei you play does blank\" carries that same feeling of security, longevity, and looking to the future, which I think embodies the Draenei really well.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nQ: Where do you begin in terms of designing this card set? Was there a foundational pillar card that you designed around?\n\nGonzalez: With every expansion, the very first thing I think about when we decide on the theme is that we're looking for things we've never done before. Something that can stand out from anything we've done, but also something that can fully cover an entire card set and has depth. It needs to allow each class to stand out on its own, do something super unique with the theme, and offer something brand new for the class.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nIdeally, I think, with space, this set has two major pockets. One is the Draenei story against the Burning Legion, and the other is space. Both of those are super, super rich with content that we just haven't really done before. I mean, we've seen Draenei before, we've seen demons before, and in the Titan set, there was some spacey stuff there, but we've never really gone this far.\n\nThe example I love bringing up is Kil'jaeden and Archimonde. These are two super well-known Warcraft characters that a lot of people love, but they just haven't been in a Hearthstone card set. It's been, like, 10 years, right? We finally got them! I think if that is just the first step of, \"We got to have those characters in,\" there's so much more to pull from. All the five Exarchs of the Draenei are individual, unique characters. One of my personal favorites is Ascara, the Priest Legendary. There's a really cool story behind that character -- basically sacrificing herself so her entire race could escape the Burning Legion.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nMason: Jumping off that from an art standpoint, there were a lot of times where, once you're turning all these larger ideas and condensing them down into a minion illustration or a spell illustration, it became clear to us early on that we needed to ensure that, at a glance, it reads as not being on Azeroth, not on Argus, not a known planet that players are familiar with.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nOne of the solutions that the artists came up with was creating these really beautiful, colorful landscapes. All the skies are vibrant, and the fauna is full of unusual shapes. There are new aliens for them to encounter. Then, when you're actually in the Great Dark Beyond, a lot of these colorful novas are in view. It's no longer just a bunch of things over an entirely pitch-black void, which in itself has its own lore implications, but we're able to get a sort of Hearthstone-style colorful whimsy and leave a little bit of a 'this is our take on space' feel.\n\nQ: On the art side, how do you approach designing a card set so that cards are individually distinct and recognizable in gameplay, while also being internally consistent with the theme?\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nMason: I'd say for this one, you have a lot of Draenei, and you have, as we've alluded to, the Burning Legion representation. I think it usually comes down to the class identity I mentioned before. A lot of the different starships you see do a great job representing what these different classes are all about. My personal favorite is the Druid starship.\n\nWith the Draenei being so focused on lore and maintaining all of their history, the concept artist described it as a giant crystalline ship with scrolls and scrolls of runic Draenei language written across it, overflowing outside the ship. At all times, there's arcane magic constantly writing down what has happened. And this has been going on for thousands of years, so it's become a part of the entire visual aesthetic.\n\nYou can see this across all of them. The Death Knight has this really cool, skull-themed, very ominous look that's distinct from the Burning Legion. The Burning Legion, of course, is something players are familiar with, so we could reference what Warcraft did, with the cool fel thrusters coming out of it.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nAs far as the actual starship mechanic, we had to bring all these different starships together. Early on, we knew we couldn't create custom visuals for every single class, so it was about finding the right balance. For example, the Burning Legion's visuals shouldn't have Draenei language or holy magic.\n\nWe wanted the classes that use those elements to retain them. We opted for a more digitized look that seemed generic enough, but as we went in that direction, we realized it wasn't really feeling like Hearthstone. We have such a strong fantasy influence that we couldn't just throw 8-bit pixels over everything and call it a space expansion. It felt almost too Sci-Fi.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nThat's where Leo helped me see the larger vision of 'space magic.' This is the element they all share. We can lean into that -- Titans in our previous expansion hinted at it, but now it's front and center. We're doing different runes scribed into the board, we're jumping into light speed with all those familiar media tropes. It involved a lot of exploration, finding what felt right, deciding on a new visual benchmark, and then bringing everything together to make it sing.\n\nGetting Starships Right In Hearthstone's Great Dark Beyond Expansion\n\nIt must be challenging trying not to lean too far into sci-fi when depicting fantasy space travel. How did you approach that balance?\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nGonzalez: I love talking about the origins of where it started because it's really unique. We actually started working on what would become Starship in the mini-set for Whizbang's Workshop. I don't know if you played way, way back in Whispers of the Old Gods, but there were the C'Thun decks, where you have this giant Old God in your deck, you buff it, and then you play it. It's this giant moment -- really fun, really awesome deck. It's one of my personal favorites from back in the day, and I know a lot of players feel the same way.\n\nIn Whizbang's Workshop, when we worked on the mini-set, the original brief was themed around evil toys, misfit toys. When we started working on that, one of the ideas I tried to sketch out was building a toy version of C'Thun, where the cultists that buff C'Thun are actually little toys that you kind of plug onto the C'Thun toy itself, creating this giant toy amalgamation.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nThe initial versions we playtested weren't good; they weren't shippable. There were a host of issues and things to figure out, but there was something core to the idea that felt really fun. Our design team all felt like there was something here that we really liked. We knew it was going to be cool, but we just didn't have the time for it then. Mini-sets are small and have fewer cards, so we didn't feel confident about delivering what we wanted at the time. So we paused and tabled it.\n\nThen, when it came time for me to lead this set, I basically unpaused everything, brought it back to the table, and said, \"Alright, let's re-flavor it. You're building a giant starship. Let's continue where we left off.\" That extra time we had from that mini-set was crucial. It was vital for getting Starships out the door in a way players could enjoy. So much work went into this from so many different teams. The design work alone was more than the average mechanic, and the engineering work -- I'd 100% say that was more than usual, too. For VFX and art, I'd say it was probably about the same.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nMason: It was super cross-disciplinary, which honestly made it a lot of fun. Even when we would find, say, that space magic was working here, then we'd need to design the look of the starships, and we had these different design options to consider. We'd see one that kind of incorporates stained-glass iconography into the wings and think, \"Hey, wait, this is working. That was working in the other part, too -- let's bring that over here.\"\n\nIt kind of answered more questions as we worked on it, allowing us to pull cool ideas from various places. I'm super happy with it, especially as an important keyword, featured so prominently in the set.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nQ: How did you approach making the Starship mechanic mesh with the playstyles of each class?\n\nGonzalez: There were a lot of things to consider when we deliberately decided which classes would get starships. For starters, there's the question of why not every class? Why just six? In my heart of hearts, I wish it could be every class, but starships and starship pieces are so difficult to design. To put it bluntly, the design space for what constitutes an interesting starship piece is more narrow than you might think at first. The coolest part of starships is the combinatorics, but you also need to make sure the combination of the two class pieces is the most exciting part, while still being relevant for neutral pieces.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nThere's also the value proposition to consider. When you play a starship piece, it shouldn't be so valuable that you just want to play it by itself -- that's not the fun part. The fun part is combining cards, so early on we knew that starships would probably only be for about half of the classes, and there was a lot to decide regarding which ones would get them.\n\nOne of the first things we considered was fantasy. Since only some of the classes would get starships, we decided that for the other new thing in the set -- the Draenei -- we would give the other classes devoted Draenei decks. From there, we thought about which classes felt most in tune with the Draenei fantasy. The obvious ones were Priest, Paladin, and Mage.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nAnother thing we had to think about was play style. Some classes like to play slower, and some prefer a faster pace. In some cases, we went against the grain and gave a faster class a starship, while with others we went with the grain. A good example is Warlock. They've had their fair share of slow control decks, so giving them a starship felt right. It just made sense, and narratively, they were the ones who got the Legion starship that Luke was talking about -- the one that's very visually different. That thematic idea really resonated with all of us.\n\nOn the flip side, Rogue doesn't really have slow decks. If they do, they're usually combo decks, right? They're typically fast and aggressive.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nIt was interesting to give them access to a mechanic that naturally wants to play a bit slower. I think the fact that Rogues are all about burgling and stealing from other classes made it fun to give them a burgled starship. It also saved us a lot of design time because we didn't need to make as many unique pieces for Rogue. Instead, the cool thing about theirs was combining pieces from different classes and reinterpreting the context of those designs. This, in turn, promotes a slower game plan for Rogue that feels fresh and different in a cool way.\n\nQ: What do you feel are the strengths of the Draenei minion cards, and how might players counter that?\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nGonzalez: I think the biggest strength of Draenei is that sense of security that I talked about previously. When I play my Draenei, it says my next Draenei is going to gain Rush, and that's gonna happen. We've had cards in the past that are, \"If you control a Murloc, do a thing,\" or other things like \"Give a friendly Undead Reborn.\" Those are great, right? Not knocking those cards at all. But there's an extra hurdle with playing those.\n\nWith Draenei, it's very much about sequencing your turns, planning ahead, and making decisions with what you've got, and I think that's where the strength really lies. I think Draenei decks are deceptive. There's this intrinsic desire, when playing a minion-type deck, to just put them all in your deck, thinking they're gonna synergize -- yay! But I think with a lot of the Draenei decks, it's not the case.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nFor example, Draenei Priest with Askara's Battlecry to summon the next Draenei you play. There are very selective Draenei you want that to hit, so all the little cheap Draenei -- you maybe just don't run so they don't get in the way. Those deck-building decisions are really interesting.\n\nI think the counterplay aspect is also important. Going back to that Rush example: If I play that card that says the next Draenei I play is going to get Rush, as the opponent, I'm like, \"Okay, that's gonna happen. Do I really want to play these minions that I was going to play this turn, or should I reevaluate and try to do something else?\"\n\nThe fact that the effects are a little bit face-up is good for both players, which is really cool. It's just good for totally different reasons, but it feels very fluid.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nQ: Do you have favorite cards from this set that stand out to you for any reason?\n\nMason: For me, one card that really stood out -- just from a visual perspective -- was the Ceaseless Expanse. This was a 100-mana cost card, and when we first saw it in the spreadsheet, we all just stared at each other, like, \"Wait, I've never seen three digits in a mana cost before. What are we going to do with this?\"\n\nOn the visual effects team, we usually scale the intensity of our visuals based on mana cost. For example, early one-cost legendaries have more subtle visuals -- low stakes -- but as the mana cost increases, the visuals should feel like a bigger payoff, something that matches the anticipation built up over the course of the game. But with a 100-mana card, this was one of the few times we actually said, \"We need to go bigger,\" not pull back.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nWe wanted it to feel like a massive event. At one point, we even considered having the entire board behind your minions crumble when Ceaseless Expanse hits the board. Figuring out how to make that work was a huge challenge. You're literally making eye contact with Ceaseless Expanse itself, and we wanted to make it feel like this game-changing moment. There were also discussions about having a hand come in from outside the board, but we had to scrap that idea as time ran out.\n\nBut when players rank the best card animations of all time, I definitely think Ceaseless Expanse earned its spot.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nGonzalez: I'll also plus-one that Ceaseless Expanse is not only a favorite of mine, but it seems like the community also likes that card. I've got two other answers. One, which I think is another very, very obvious answer, is Kil'jaeden. He's a character that I think everyone has wanted to see in Hearthstone, and I think the effects that we came up with for him are perfect. I think one of the things I really like, especially since the Sargeras titan that we made, is I really like demons that have that sense of inevitability. I think that's a really cool, unique space to explore for how to define the demon minion type.\n\nKil'jaeden, replacing your deck with a portal that never ends, you're not going to fatigue, and the demons only get bigger -- it's like that to a T. My other answer, which is just personal because I love this card, is the Druid legendary, Uluu, the Everdrifter. It's this turtle -- like, a world turtle -- with a planet on its back, just flying through space, but its effect is that every turn, it just randomly grabs two different Choose One options from anything valid in the format and staples them together. Now you have to choose one between those two.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nI don't know how that card came to be, but I think it's hilarious. I think it's funny. There are moments when it's really good, but just seeing the Choose One options change every turn just makes me smile every time.\n\nQ: Any final thoughts you'd like to share?\n\nGonzalez: I don't have any revolutionary mic-drop thing, but I just really appreciate everyone who's been looking forward to this set. Everybody's reception has been really heartwarming and motivating for me personally. I know the team worked really hard on this, and everyone's stoked to see it go live.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nI guess the one thing I'll say is we've got the Tavern Brawl right now that lets you open packs and play early. Go check that out. But otherwise, thank you.\n\nMason: Plus one to that. Leo's been an amazing set lead. A lot of real fun, playing a little bit outside of our normal fantasy and getting a sort of a mix-up of genres. But now we're super, super happy with all the things we've been able to do and excited for what's coming next in the future.\n\n[END]\n\n6 Images\n\n6 Images\n\nClose\n\nHearthstone\n\nDigital Card Game\n\nSystems\n\nOpenCritic Reviews Top Critic Rating:87/100 Critics Recommend:93%\n\nFranchise Warcraft\n\nPlatform(s) PC , macOS , iOS , Android\n\nReleased March 11, 2014\n\nDeveloper(s) Blizzard\n\nPublisher(s) Blizzard\n\nMultiplayer Online Multiplayer\n\nEngine Unity\n\nESRB T for Teen: Alcohol Reference, Blood, Fantasy Violence, Mild Suggestive Themes\n\nOpenCritic Rating Mighty\n\nExpand"

Morrell Trust and the York Area Society of Friends (Quakers).\n\nProfessor Esther McIntosh, Director of the Centre for Religion in Society, said: \"I am delighted that Chine McDonald will be giving the Winter 2024 Ebor lecture. Chine's book God is not a White Man was published just as churches were grappling with their response to the Black Lives Matter movement and repeated criticisms of institutional racism.\n\n(Image: Pic supplied)\n\n\"Now, following the riots across the UK this summer, Chine's reflection on race, identity and Christianity couldn't be more timely. The Ebor Lectures aim to promote conversation about pertinent public issues, and Chine's talk will do just that\"\n\nChine says she is fascinated by the intertwining of religion and faith as well as race and faith.\n\nShe explained: \"This year, all of those elements combined during the riots we saw take place across the country over the summer. I feel despite this interplay, these elements are underexplored.\n\n\"I think we need to wrestle much more with how religion affects or is utilised by racist and Far Right movements, and I believe better understanding of religious ideas are needed to explore these elements in a way that is effective.\"\n\nChine continued: \"Contrary to popular belief, religion is not in decline -- it's just changing shape. People are as religious as they ever were. We see this most vividly in multicultural societies in the UK where there exists a melting pot of culture, identity and belief.\"\n\nThere is also an evolving concept of God, which has changed throughout society, reflecting culture and the dominant cultural narratives of the times.\n\nChine further explained: \"When it comes to Christian theology, what we see today around perceptions of God are based in 19th century European - and often male - theological ideas.\n\n\"I think recent decades and recent years have created the space for us to question whether those ideas are right, or whether they represent a very narrow view of human experience of God.\"\n\nThe academic says the free event at 5pm at the University's Creative Centre and online is open to all and she hopes it will expand perspectives and maybe even change minds.\n\nWrite no more than 250 words and please provide your full name, address, and mobile number."

        "content": "His insights on police brutality, inequality and racism still resonate today. His voice still resonates in discussions about race, sex and equality.\n\nWho was James Baldwin? James Baldwin, one of America's most influential writers, continues to inspire decades after his death. His unflinching exploration of race, sexuality and social justice was vital in his time and remains relevant today.\n\nBaldwin, born James Arthur Baldwin on Aug. 2, 1924, at Harlem Hospital, was the eldest of nine children. His mother, Emma Berdis Jones, raised him with her husband and James' stepfather, David Baldwin, a Baptist preacher.\n\nJames Baldwin's family struggled with poverty, and he faced the dual challenges of racial discrimination and financial instability during his early years. His mother was a strong, positive force throughout his childhood.\n\nBaldwin's relationship with his strict and religious stepfather had a lasting impact on his worldview. This complex relationship would later inspire some of his most powerful writing, particularly in his semi-autobiographical novel \"Go Tell It on the Mountain,\" published by Dial Press.\n\nEducation and preaching\n\nExceptional educators quickly recognized and nurtured Baldwin's talent. Gertrude Elise Ayer, New York City's first Black principal, identified Baldwin's potential during his time at P.S. 24.\n\nBaldwin became a junior preacher at 14 after a profound religious experience. Over the next three years, he preached, honing his oratory skills and developing a deep understanding of biblical cadence and rhythms that would later characterize his writing.\n\nThis phase of his life was transformative, teaching him the power of language to stir and convince audiences. However, his increasing recognition of the church's inconsistencies and contradictions, coupled with his own evolving sense of self, eventually led him away from the pulpit.\n\nLater years in New York\n\nBaldwin graduated high school in 1942 and began navigating the challenges of young adulthood in New York City. While pursuing his passion for writing, he took on odd jobs to support his family. During this time, Baldwin formed connections with artists and intellectuals, including mentor and father figure Beauford Delaney. Delaney introduced Baldwin to the vibrant cultural and artistic scene of Greenwich Village.\n\nThe young Black writer began to frequent Greenwich Village's cafes and bars, participating in discussions about literature, politics and society. These experiences, coupled with his growing awareness of racial and sexual discrimination, shaped his consciousness as a writer and social critic.\n\nLife in Paris (1948-1957)\n\nAt the age of 24 in 1948, Baldwin made a pivotal decision. He purchased a one-way ticket to Paris with only $40 in his pocket. He moved to Paris to escape American racism and homophobia, hoping to find the space and distance he needed to write about his experiences with clarity and perspective.\n\nIt worked. Paris allowed Baldwin to explore his identity and art without the pressures of American racial politics. He met and became friends with French writer Marguerite Yourcenar and French actor Yves Montand.\n\nThere, he completed his debut novel, \"Go Tell It on the Mountain,\" and developed the sharp, incisive voice that would make him famous. The distance from America allowed him to examine its racial dynamics more clearly, leading to his most impactful essays.\n\nKey themes in Baldwin's writing\n\nJames Baldwin's books focus on the following three interconnected themes, each examined with remarkable depth and nuance.\n\nRace and identity\n\nIn Baldwin's exploration of race and identity, he went beyond politics to examine racism's psychological and spiritual effects on both the oppressor and the oppressed. In books like \"Notes of a Native Son\" and \"The Fire Next Time,\" he showed how racial prejudice twisted American society, including the American dream.\n\nSexuality and personal struggle\n\nBaldwin explored sexuality and personal struggle, especially within societal expectations and the search for identity. In groundbreaking novels like \"Giovanni's Room,\" he wrote about sexuality and love with an honesty uncommon for his time, especially in his portrayal of same-sex relationships. His experiences as a gay Black man shaped his understanding of self-expression and marginalization.\n\nSocial justice and activism\n\nSocial justice and activism were natural extensions of Baldwin's artistic vision. He believed an artist's role is inherently political -- social consciousness and creativity can't be truly separated. This belief was clear in his unflinching critiques of American society and active participation in the civil rights movement.\n\nLiterary career\n\nBaldwin's literary career was a combination of works that skillfully blended personal experience with broader social commentary.\n\nFirst writings and move to Europe\n\nIn the 1940s, Baldwin's literary career started to take off when writing essays and book reviews for publications like \"New Leader\" and \"The Nation.\" But it was his decision to go to Europe in 1948 that truly sped up his growth as a writer. Living in cheap Paris hotels, Baldwin kept writing through his struggles and self-discovery. This led to the publication of his first novel, \"Go Tell It on the Mountain\" in 1953.\n\nThe semi-autobiographical work took him almost a decade to complete. Its publication opened the door for Baldwin to publish more books, establishing him as a notable new literary voice.\n\nIn 1955, Baldwin released his first collection of essays \"Notes of a Native Son.\" The collection included his groundbreaking essay \"Everybody's Protest Novel,\" which challenged the prevailing approaches to racial literature, including Harriet Beecher Stowe's \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" and Richard Wright's \"Native Son.\"\n\nCivil rights activism and 'The Fire Next Time'\n\nBaldwin returned to the United States in 1957, drawn by the growing intensity of the civil rights movement. He quickly became a leading voice known for his passion and eloquence. In 1963, he published \"The Fire Next Time,\" a groundbreaking book that shaped the era. The book, composed of two essays, offered a powerful examination of race relations in America. It both warned of the dangers and offered hope for the future.\n\nDuring this time, Baldwin became more active in civil rights activism. He used his growing fame to support the cause and regularly joined civil rights protests, pushing for civil rights legislation. In the process, he developed close relationships with Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Medgar Evers and other civil rights leaders. Yet, he also insisted on maintaining his independence as a thinker and writer, challenging everyone, regardless of their politics, to confront their own role in maintaining racist systems.\n\nBaldwin's activism was unique. Instead of evoking sympathy, he wanted to compel readers to become empathetic enough to take action.\n\nMajor works of James Baldwin\n\nJames Baldwin's titles span multiple genres over several decades, with each work contributing to his reputation as a prominent American writer. His major works include:\n\n'Go Tell It on the Mountain' (1953)\n\nThis book is partly about James Baldwin's own life. It tells the story of John Grimes, a young boy in 1930s Harlem. John struggles with who he is, his family and his faith. Baldwin used his experiences as a teenage preacher to write about religion and his complicated relationship with his stepfather to explore family dynamics.\n\n'Notes of a Native Son' (1955)\n\nThese essay collections made Baldwin a premier American essayist. The title essay, which connects his father's death to the Harlem riot of 1943, is the perfect example of how he could weave personal stories with social analysis. The collection showcases Baldwin's talent for examining American race relations with personal insight and intellectual rigor.\n\n'Giovanni's Room' (1956)\n\nThis novel was groundbreaking because it honestly showed same-sex love and desire. Set in Paris, the story follows an American man who struggles with his sexuality and identity. Baldwin chose to write about white characters in the book, challenging people's expectations about what Black authors could write about.\n\n'The Fire Next Time' (1963)\n\nThis book is probably Baldwin's most influential work. It elevated him to new heights of literary and social influence. Published during the civil rights movement, this book challenges readers of all backgrounds to confront their role in keeping racist systems going.\n\n'If Beale Street Could Talk' (1974)\n\nThis novel tells the story of a young Black couple torn apart by a false criminal accusation. The book paints a powerful picture of a Black family's struggles in 1970s Harlem. Baldwin balanced his justified anger at societal injustice with a deep, underlying current of love.\n\nImpact on literature and society\n\nBaldwin's social commentary on race relations and social justice had a lasting impact far beyond his time. His understanding of the interconnected nature of oppression and the need to address both personal and systemic aspects of racism is still relevant to today's movements.\n\nBaldwin's work on race and identity added psychological depth to the conversation. His style was a unique blend of literary traditions and the rhythms of the church. By combining his personal experiences with social criticism, he inspired many writers, forging a new path for creative nonfiction and autobiography.\n\nBaldwin proved that great literature can serve social justice and that political engagement need not sacrifice artistic integrity. His legacy inspires writers and activists in their attempts at addressing today's social issues.\n\nLater career and honors\n\nBaldwin's later works, like \"If Beale Street Could Talk\" and \"Just Above My Head,\" continued to explore race, sexuality and family. \"If Beale Street Could Talk\" emphasizes the importance of family and community in the face of systemic oppression. Baldwin's portrayal of Tish's strength and Fonny's unjust imprisonment shows the personal and societal challenges Black Americans face.\n\n\"Just Above My Head\" explores love, loss and the impact of the civil rights movement on personal relationships. The story blends themes of identity, sexuality and belonging, showing how Baldwin's characters navigate their lives at a time of social turmoil. The novel also reflects Baldwin's continued exploration of queer identities within the African American experience, expanding his literary contributions beyond traditional storylines.\n\nAs a cultural critic, Baldwin explored the psychological and emotional complexities of racism, rejecting simple binaries and solutions. His analysis of whiteness and its impact on society was ahead of contemporary critical race theory. In retrospect, his understanding of interconnected identities anticipated important developments in social theory.\n\nBaldwin was one of the most respected Black novelists of the 20th century. His books are some of the most recommended classics by Black authors. He was also a powerful public speaker and active in civil rights discussions.\n\nThroughout his career, Baldwin won many awards for his literary skill and unwavering commitment to civil rights:\n\nAlthough Baldwin never won some of the highest literary prizes of his time, his influence is still growing many years after his death.\n\nLegacy of James Baldwin\n\nJames Baldwin's voice still resonates in discussions about race, sex and equality. His influence is seen across today's culture, from literature and academia to film and television.\n\nNew audiences are learning about James Baldwin's work and ideas thanks to the 2016 Raoul Peck's documentary \"I Am Not Your Negro\" and the 2018 Barry Jenkins's film adaptation of \"If Beale Street Could Talk.\" In 2021, never before seen James Baldwin interview surfaced where he explains why he wrote \"Giovanni's Room.\" Last year, the film division at Allen Media Group tapped Bill Porter and Dan McCabe to write a James Baldwin Screenplay.\n\nBaldwin's works are now standard texts in American literature, African American studies and social justice courses. His essays offer crucial insights into American history and society, while the artistry and moral clarity of his novels continue to inspire and challenge readers.\n\nWhat makes Baldwin's legacy particularly enduring is his emphasis on the role of love in social transformation. He saw love as a radical force for change, not merely a personal emotion. This approach of combining critique with compassion still influences how activists and writers approach social justice issues."

        "content": "Democrats have a choice. They can either accept that their radicalism on race, sex, and identity has driven away voters or continue to blame 'whiteness' and bigotry for their defeat.\n\nJudging by the analysis on cable news since the election, Democrats seem determined to lose every presidential race for years to come.\n\nThe party should be reflecting deeply after Kamala Harris spent more than $1 billion and secured endorsements from celebrities and billionaires, only to lose to Donald Trump. Democrats should be asking how a man they've called a fascist, racist Nazi sympathizer managed to win support from such a diverse group of voters.\n\nIf progressives had any sense, they would learn to listen to what people say instead of projecting their own biases onto millions of Americans they do not know and do not understand.\n\nInstead of addressing their mistakes, Democrats and their cable news allies continue to focus on the identity politics that voters rejected. Several analysts have claimed they know why Trump won, but their explanation ignores issues like economics, inflation, crime, or immigration.\n\nNo, they say the reason comes down to one word: whiteness.\n\nMSNBC contributor Eddie Glaude made this claim during a recent election postmortem. With intense passion and conviction, the Princeton professor insisted he could not see any other explanation. Though he never defined \"whiteness,\" he was certain it's what motivated the masses.\n\nI shared his video on social media, telling him he sounded more like a religious cleric than a political analyst. He's not alone in this rhetoric. While progressives have become more secular over the past few decades, they still exhibit religious impulses. Their discourse on \"whiteness\" reflects their view of original sin. They have major and minor \"prophets\" of race and are eager to evangelize unbelievers on topics like \"white privilege,\" \"systemic racism,\" and \"white supremacy.\" They view dissenters with contempt, as seen in their criticism of Latino voters who hopped on the Trump train.\n\nThey see nonbelievers not as people to persuade but as sinners to redeem.\n\nThis fixation on \"whiteness\" is not only simplistic but also fuels racial conflict that the left is ill-equipped to handle. A year ago, a black Christian woman sparked controversy in the evangelical community when she told a room full of white women that they must \"divest from whiteness,\" which she described as rooted in plunder, theft, slavery, and genocide. I'm no minister, but I know my Bible well enough to understand that no group -- regardless of race, ethnicity, or nationality -- holds a monopoly on sin.\n\nI remember thinking then, as I do now, that the public would have a fit if a white commentator blamed \"blackness\" for voters' choices in this election. Conservatives who claimed \"blackness\" is rooted in self-destruction and broken families would be shunned and shamed, not celebrated as prophetic truth-tellers.\n\nThis is why impartiality is a crucial ingredient for healthy discourse in the public square. An honest person should apply the same standards to friends and opponents alike. Moreover, the way we speak about other groups is how we should expect others to speak about us.\n\nThis principle is nonpartisan and non-ideological. If you need an extra therapy session because a white conservative criticizes a black liberal on legitimate grounds, you shouldn't write headlines labeling angry white men as the most frightening people in America.\n\nPeople pushing identity politics are a cancerous tumor on our body politic. Not only do they reduce Americans to their immutable traits, but they also create the perfect breeding ground for extremist views. Put simply, when you \"sow\" Robin DiAngelo, you will \"reap\" David Duke.\n\nThis is not unique to white people. Rejection of moderation almost always leads to radicalism.\n\nImagine a 17-year-old black kid in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1964 watching his parents going out to a civil rights march to protest segregation. Having learned about the First Amendment in school, he assumes law enforcement officials will respect his parents and that their grievances will be heard by their elected officials.\n\nBut when he turns on TV that night, he sees them being sprayed with water hoses, attacked by dogs, and beaten over the head with clubs by police. When that teen sees how the white people in power treated his parents -- Christians dressed in their Sunday best -- no one should be surprised if he is drawn to the more militant posture of the Black Panthers.\n\nThe same principle applies today. Young white men have been told that they are the cause of all the country's problems and are constantly painted as racists only concerned about maintaining power. They see how every white conservative, from George W. Bush to Mitt Romney, is called racist or compared to a Nazi at some point.\n\nThey see how perfectly mediocre academics get rich by pushing seminars on \"white fragility\" and \"white rage.\" Most are not nearly as race-obsessed as the liberals on television, but some are ripe for the picking by white identitarians who will affirm both their race and sex and won't attack them for how they were born.\n\nThe left does not want to hear that analysis, but that doesn't make it any less true. When you open the door to the demons of identity, you have no idea what's coming through that portal. If progressives had any sense, they would learn to listen to what people say instead of projecting their own biases onto millions of Americans they do not know, have never met, and do not understand.\n\nDemocrats have a choice. They can either accept the fact that their radicalism on race, sex, and identity has driven away voters or continue to blame \"whiteness\" and bigotry for their defeat.\n\nThis may be one of the last elections in which their silly theories will be taken seriously. Donald Trump earned about 55% of the Latino male vote, roughly 20 percentage points more than in 2020. While he didn't make significant gains with black men nationwide, there were regional differences in the support he received. For example, about 25% of black men in Pennsylvania voted for Trump. If Democrats don't do some honest self-reflection, the \"white supremacists\" they criticize on the right will be more diverse than their own party."

        "content": "* Book bans are on the rise as conservative parental rights groups fight what they believe is 'wokeness' in classrooms.\n\n* They typically target books about race and gender identity, and the election of Trump is strengthening their efforts.\n\nThe national furor in recent years around banning books on race and gender in public schools is intensifying as President-elect Donald Trump threatens to shut down the Department of Education, emboldening conservatives to end \"wokeness\" in classrooms.\n\nBattles over books in school libraries have become emblematic of the country's larger culture wars over race, historical revisionism and gender identity. A new report by PEN America found book bans increased by nearly 200% during the 2023-24 school year, including titles on sexuality, substance abuse, depression and other issues students face in an age of accelerating technologies, climate change, toxic politics and fears about the future.\n\nBook censorship has shaken and divided school boards, pitted parents against parents, and led to threats against teachers and librarians. It is part of an agenda driven by conservative parental rights groups and politicians who promote charter schools and voucher systems that could weaken public education. The issue goes to the heart not only of what students are taught but how federal and state education policies will affect the nation's politics after one of the most consequential elections in its history.\n\n\"It's not just about taking a book off a shelf,\" said Tasslyn Magnusson, an author and teacher from Wisconsin who tracks book censorship across the U.S. \"It's about power and who controls public education. It's about what kind of America we were and are. We're trying to define what family is and what America means. That comes down to the stories we tell.\"\n\nShe said she feared Trump's return to the White House would further incite those calling for book bans: \"I don't have lots of hope. It could get a lot worse.\"\n\nOver the last year, PEN counted more than 10,000 book bans nationwide that targeted 4,231 unique titles. Most were books dealing with gender, sexuality, race and LGBTQ+ storylines. The most banned title was Jodi Picoult's \"Nineteen Minutes,\" about a school shooting that included a short description of date rape. Florida and Iowa -- both of which have strict regulations on what students can read -- accounted for more than 8,200 bans in the 2023-24 school year.\n\n\"This crisis is tragic for young people hungry to understand the world they live in and see their identities and experiences reflected in books,\" Kasey Meehan, director of PEN's Freedom to Read Program, said in a statement. \"What students can read in schools provides the foundation for their lives.\"\n\nTrump's calls to close the Department of Education would need congressional approval, which appears unlikely. Although public schools are largely funded and governed by state and local institutions, the department helps pay to educate students with disabilities, provides about $18 billion in grants for K-12 schools in poor communities and oversees a civil rights branch to protect students from discrimination.\n\nBut Trump's election has inspired conservative parental groups, including Moms For Liberty and Parents Defending Education, to strengthen efforts to limit what they see as a liberal conspiracy to indoctrinate children with books and teachings that are perverse, amoral and pornographic.\n\nTiffany Justice, co-founder of Moms for Liberty, has criticized schools that she says spend too much time on diversity and inclusion when only about one-third of U.S. children are reading at grade level: \"We're talking about public school libraries and content for kids,\" Justice told NewsNation after Trump's victory. \"I think it's very clear that there are certain things that are appropriate for kids, certain things that are appropriate for adults. We're just getting back to commonsense America.\"\n\nTrump's threat to deny federal funding to schools that acknowledge transgender identities could affect curricula and the kinds of books school libraries stock. During his rally at Madison Square Garden in October, Trump -- who has has accused schools of promoting sex change operations -- said his administration would get \"transgender insanity the hell out of our schools.\" Vice President-elect JD Vance has accused Democrats of wanting to \"put sexually explicit books in toddlers' libraries.\"\n\nNicole Neily, president of Parents Defending Education, told Newsmax that she was excited about Trump's calls to remake education and \"clean up a lot of the mess\" he has inherited from the Biden administration. Trump \"has centered parental rights back in his platform, which is incredible. He has prioritized knowledge and skill, not identity politics,\" she said. \"American children deserve better, and it is time for change.\"\n\nIn nominating Linda McMahon to be his secretary of Education, Trump appears to be pushing for more conservative parental control over what is taught and read in classrooms. A former professional wrestling executive, McMahon chairs the America First Policy Institute, a Trump-connected organization that has criticized schools for teaching \"racially divisive\" theories, notably about slavery and a perspective about the nation's founding it views as anti-American.\n\n\"Today's contentious debates over using classrooms for political activism rather than teaching a complete and accurate account of American history have reinvigorated calls for greater parental and citizen involvement in the curriculum approval process,\" the institute's website says.\n\nCulturally divisive issues, including race and LGBTQ+ themes, cost school districts an estimated $3.2 billion during the 2023-24 school year, according to a recent study called \"The Costs of Conflict.\" The survey -- published by the Institute for Democracy, Education and Access at UCLA -- found that battles over books and teaching about sexuality and other topics led to increased expenses for legal fees, replacing administrators and teachers who quit, and security, including off-duty plainclothes police officers.\n\n\"Are we really going to spend our tax dollars on these kinds of things?\" asked Magnusson. \"After Trump was elected, I saw a bunch of middle-class white ladies like me who were saying, 'This isn't America.' But maybe it is America.\"\n\nOne school superintendent in a Western state told the study's researchers that his staff was often consumed with correcting misinformation and fulfilling public record requests mainly from hard-line parental rights activists attempting to exploit cultural war issues to discredit the district. \"Our staff are spending enormous amounts of time just doing stupid stuff,\" the superintendent said. \"The fiscal costs to the district are enormous, but [so are] the cultural costs of not standing up to the extremists. If someone doesn't, then the students and employees lose. ... It's the worst it's ever been.\"\n\nThe survey found that 29% of 467 school superintendents interviewed reported that teachers and other staff quit their profession or left their districts \"due to culturally divisive conflict.\"\n\nCensoring books in school libraries grew out of opposition to COVID-19 restrictions. A number of conservative parental groups, including Moms for Liberty, which invited Trump to speak at its national convention in August, turned their attention to lobbying against \"liberal indoctrination.\" Their protests against what they criticized as progressive teaching on sexuality and race were focused on increasing conservative parental control over a public education system that was struggling at teaching children reading and math.\n\nThat strategy has led to a national, right-wing effort that is \"redefining government power to restrict access to information in our schools,\" said Stephana Ferrell, co-founder of the Florida Freedom to Read Project. \"This movement to protect the innocence of our children believes if children never read it in a book they won't have to know about it and can go on to lead harmonious lives. But books teach us cautionary tales. They instruct us. You can't protect innocence through ignorance.\"\n\nSchool districts across the country have removed \"Gender Queer\" by Maia Kobabe and \"All Boys Aren't Blue\" by George Johnson, which are about gender identity and include graphic depictions of sex, along with titles by renowned writers such as Toni Morrison, Kurt Vonnegut, George Orwell, Maya Angelou and Flannery O'Connor.\n\nSurveys show that most Americans do not favor censorship. The Florida Freedom to Read Project and similar organizations around the country have called for thorough public reviews of challenged books to prevent one scene or passage from being taken out of context. Moderate and liberal parents groups over the last two years have also become more active in school board politics. They have supported school board candidates who have defeated those backed by Moms for Liberty in Texas, Florida and other states.\n\n\"People say the pendulum will swing back,\" said Ferrell. But, she said, conservatives want to \"stop the pendulum from swinging back.\"\n\nPicoult is accustomed to conservatives attempting to censor her. Her books have been banned in schools in more than 30 states. Published in 2007, \"Nineteen Minutes\" explores the lives of characters, including a girl who was raped, in a town leading up to a school shooting and its aftermath.\n\n\"Having the most banned book in the country is not a badge of honor. It's a call for alarm,\" said Picoult, whose books have sold more than 40 million copies. \"My book, and the 10,000 others that have been pulled off school library shelves this year, give kids a tool to deal with an increasingly divided and difficult world. These book banners aren't helping children. They are harming them.\""

        "content": "The Utah lawmaker who drafted HB261 said the bill shouldn't affect clubs. But student leaders say that's not what has happened.\n\nTwo student cultural clubs have chosen to cut ties with the University of Utah after members say they faced new limits on what they could talk about during events -- including no conversations about race or identity -- and had their funding stripped in the continued fallout from the state's anti-diversity law.\n\nAdministrators also suggested that the Black Student Union consider changing its historic name so \"no one would feel excluded,\" said President Nevaeh Parker.\n\n\"No way,\" she said. \"We refuse to go backward. We're not erasing the legacy and the community we've built.\"\n\nInstead, she and the other leaders of the BSU posted a widely-shared letter on Instagram in October explaining their decision to withdraw from the U.'s sponsorship. They followed the Pacific Islander Student Association, or PISA, at the U., which had had done the same two months earlier.\n\nNow, both groups are no longer formally associated with the state's flagship school. Club leaders say that operating independently is the only way they can have a voice in a state they feel is actively trying to keep them from having one.\n\n\"We've been running as an organization for 32 years, and we can't stop there,\" said PISA President 'Alisi Fihaki.\n\nThe restrictions on clubs are the latest development in the rollout of HB261, which was passed by the Republican-majority state Legislature in January and signed into law by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox. The controversial bill took aim at diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, efforts across the state's public institutions of higher education.\n\nUtah's bill was touted for being more narrow than what's been enacted in other red states. Instead of a full elimination and budget cut, all Utah colleges and universities were required to make resources generally available to all students, with generic support and success centers that aren't based on specific identities. Any programming based on race or gender had to go.\n\nBut the impacts have been more far-reaching than lawmakers promised and than many students expected. It was a shock to some in July when most schools in the state -- including the U. -- shuttered their longstanding cultural centers. Some have since been replaced by general student centers.\n\nThe law and the bill's sponsor had explicitly allowed cultural centers to remain open, as long as the spaces were open to all. Some schools, though, have said because they wouldn't be allowed to offer resources at them, they would not be worth maintaining. And Utah's higher education commissioner said shutting them down was \"an inevitability\" anyway.\n\nStudent clubs were to remain untouched, Rep. Katy Hall, R-South Ogden, said when presenting HB261 during the legislative session -- as long as \"they don't exclude people who want to be in their group.\"\n\nHall also said: \"I don't think it's going to have as big of an impact as you might think.\"\n\nBoth PISA and the BSU said their events were always open to anyone who wanted to join and learn. But they say they were told by the U. that they would have to make additional changes to abide by the law.\n\nThe irony is, Parker said, now they're feeling shut out.\n\nThe U. says it had to follow the law\n\n(Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) Nevaeh Parker, Sadie Werner and Sandrine Mimche, of the University of Utah's Black Student Union, in Salt Lake City on Monday, Oct. 21, 2024.\n\nThe University of Utah says it had no choice but to enforce new restrictions on the cultural clubs. In response to questions from The Salt Lake Tribune, a U. spokesperson pointed to guidance from the Utah System of Higher Education, which oversees the public colleges and universities in the state.\n\nThat guidance read: \"Student organizations operating as formal administrative units are subject to the provisions of HB261.\"\n\nBSU and PISA were formally sponsored by the school, the U. said. That means they received funding from the school and from donors, were assigned a university adviser and that both groups applied to the new law.\n\nThe school's own rulebook defines sponsored clubs as \"integral to the mission and culture of the university\" and \"inherently linked to the university.\" Student government falls under that, too.\n\nOther student clubs that are \"registered\" don't fall under the new rules because they don't get money from the university. They also don't have the same access, such as not being allowed to use university trademarks and not having a reserved space on campus.\n\nThe U. sent out a letter to the leaders of sponsored clubs on June 28, noting they \"may be at risk of non-compliance\" and advising them to reach out to the school's Office of General Counsel to work through concerns. It suggested that those who didn't think they could comply with HB261 volunteer to become \"registered\" groups instead.\n\nThe letter mentioned that sponsored clubs couldn't take public positions on political or social issues outside of the university's mission. And it said any events held had to be for educational purposes.\n\nBut both BSU and PISA leaders say they feel misled. None of the information they received over the summer, before the new school year started, said they couldn't continue to hold the same events they had been, which were open to all. And no guidance indicated they couldn't discuss issues, like the biases they say they've dealt with -- as long as they didn't take a formal stance.\n\nNothing said club social media posts would need to be reviewed by a university staff member. And nothing said they would lose their funding.\n\nThe Tribune reviewed the letters sent out to students, as well as a presentation given to staff, and confirmed those details were not provided in the materials.\n\n\"We had been told that we'd having funding, space, storage, everything we had before,\" Fihaki said. \"Then everything flipped right before the semester started.\"\n\nFihaki and Parker both said they'd been operating on budgets of $11,000. Now, they were going to have nothing. That means they haven't purchased snacks for student gatherings and haven't funded the bigger events they've traditionally held -- like BSU's annual Soulfest about Black culture, or PISA's annual high school conference.\n\n\"We were trying so hard to stay within the lines of sponsorship,\" Parker said. \"We really struggled with making this decision.\"\n\nThe university confirmed it is no longer distributing funds to identity-based sponsored clubs. Those resources have instead been reallocated to the generic Center for Cultural and Community Engagement (which replaced the former Center for Equity and Student Belonging) and Student Leadership and Involvement.\n\nAny funds the clubs brought into their accounts prior to the change were returned, except for donations, which will require a separate analysis because of tax implications.\n\nIn a statement, the U.'s spokesperson Rebecca Walsh said changing student clubs' status \"from 'sponsored' to 'registered' preserves their independence to continue working with a community of students, faculty and staff without limitation on their communication and activities.\"\n\nBlack Student Union wants a safe campus space\n\n(Bethany Baker | The Salt Lake Tribune) People gather during the farewell event at the Center for Equity and Student Belonging at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City on Thursday, June 27, 2024.\n\nEvery public college campus in Utah -- a predominantly white state -- has a majority of white students. At the University of Utah, just 1% of the student body is Black.\n\nFor Sadie Werner, a Black student who was adopted by white parents here, finding the Black Student Union was vital. It gave her a space to meet others who understood her experiences, from being stared at as she walked to class to being called the N-word on campus, she said.\n\nThe club became a support system, a safe space, a family. \"It was so validating,\" she said.\n\nWhen the cultural centers shut down and the Black Student Union felt pressure to change, Werner said, her mental health started to decline.\n\n\"We, as the Black community on campus, could not speak about our opinions, our history,\" Werner said. \"It seemed like even the Civil Rights Act was off-limits. It feels dystopian. I can't talk about it, but I know when you look at me you see a Black woman first.\"\n\nBlack student unions specifically formed out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 -- including the one at the U. Werner had previously been the president of the club and stepped down in protest of the U.'s restrictions.\n\nIn their Instagram post, Werner and Parker, along with Sandrine Mimche, the vice president of BSU, wrote about the unions' histories.\n\nFormer faculty member Ronald Coleman recalled in a 1989 article in The Daily Utah Chronicle, the student newspaper at the University of Utah, that he experienced racism and bigotry when he attended the school and played on the football team. The union at the time organized major protests -- particularly against housing discrimination after he and other Black football players were denied off-campus apartments because of their race.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by U of U BSU (@uofubsu)\n\nThe union has fought hard over the years to improve the environment at the U. That was celebrated in 2020 when the BSU teamed up with student government on campus on a joint resolution to create the Black Advisory Council -- focused on recruiting and retaining Black students, faculty and staff.\n\nThe U. also started a George Floyd Memorial Fund -- named for the Black man killed by police in Minneapolis in 2020 that spurred nationwide protests -- to help support Black students at the school in his honor.\n\nBut now, the Black Cultural Center that led both the fund and the council has moved to close under HB261. In their post, the BSU leaders called that \"truly heartbreaking.\"\n\n\"Our community has suffered under the weight of this bill and its destruction from the moment it passed,\" they said.\n\nParker said she, Werner and Mimche felt they could no longer be silent. They had hoped the university would have spoken up against the bill, but when it didn't, they decided to.\n\n\"To all students who have felt lost, frustrated, confused, disappointed and saddened by these changes -- you are not alone,\" they wrote. \"We see you. We love you. We need you here on this campus. We have not forgotten about you and we will continue fighting for your place at the University of Utah and beyond. The Black Student Union exists to serve you.\"\n\nThey've felt empowered by the response to their posts, with other students and community groups expressing solidarity. But there's worry, too.\n\nParker doesn't want the BSU to die out. She is scared she could be the union's last president if they don't find funding separate from the university and ways to continue engaging with students. There's currently about 200 members.\n\nThe club's leaders have set up an online fundraiser to collect money from donors interested in supporting them. And people can also reach out by email at BSUoftheUofU@gmail.com.\n\n\"I want to take our power back,\" Parker said.\n\nShe envisions a community of U. students that meet regularly for poetry slams, guest speakers, rollerskating, studying or eating. She wants Black students on campus to be celebrated. \"We have so many different ideas,\" she added.\n\nMost of all, she wants the club to remain a place where anyone -- particularly those like Werner -- can find support for who they are.\n\n(Francisco Kjolseth | The Salt Lake Tribune) Nevaeh Parker of the Northern Utah Black Lives Matter movement addresses the crown as Utah activists gather for a march at Utah's Capitol on Friday, August 28, 2020, to commemorate the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington in D.C. led by Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nPacific Islander Student Association worries about future members\n\nDestinee Tui, the vice president of PISA, said being the first group to break away from the U.'s sponsorship was difficult, something she and Fihaki agonized over.\n\n\"I'd be lying if I told you it was an easy decision,\" Tui said. \"It wasn't easy for us.\"\n\nPacific Islander and Native Hawaiian students are the smallest minority on the U.'s campus, making up about 0.3% of the population. Being sponsored by the U. gave PISA a platform, and they largely used it to try to get more students from that background to attend the school.\n\nPISA annually held a high school conference with about 500 students; its largest-ever event was hosted in spring. It introduced prospective students to campus life and explained how they could apply for scholarships.\n\nNow, they're looking at not being able to afford to have such students visit. It's cost about $3,000 from their university bank account each year.\n\n\"It's hard to do without funding,\" Fihaki said.\n\nBut Fihaki and Tui said, like the BSU leaders, that they couldn't stay tied to the U. when they felt like that meant they couldn't be themselves.\n\nTui said their club was specifically advised not to talk about or hold any events that mentioned the colonialism that many Pacific Islander communities have faced -- with administrators saying it violated HB261.\n\n\"They're having us restrict ourselves from mentioning it,\" she said. \"At the same time, that's an event that happened. And you can't take that away.\"\n\nPISA leaders mentioned Utah's anti-DEI bill in their Instagram post on Aug. 6 announcing the club would withdraw its sponsorship from the school.\n\n\"Our mission and values do not align with the guidelines,\" they wrote. \"We acknowledge that we will be forfeiting any funding from the university, but we as leadership would rather redirect our efforts in maintaining our safe space for our members, current and prospective.\"\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by UTAH PISA (@uofu.pisa)\n\nTui and Fihaki said PISA has existed on campus at the U. since 1992 -- before most students in the club today were born.\n\n\"We can be your home away from home,\" Tui said. \"We have a lot of members who are not from Utah. They're from California or Hawaii and all around the world. And if they're having trouble, we'll always be there. If you need someone to drive you to the doctor, we will do that.\"\n\nFihaki worries about how they'll reach students now and, without resources, how they'll support them.\n\n\"I think it's worth the effort,\" she said. \"But it's so stressful. We basically have to be our own advisers now.\"\n\nThey held a small event this fall for club members -- about 80 -- to meet the leaders and grab a sticker.\n\nThey want to return to bigger events, like study halls, dances, cultural cooking events and basket-weaving demos. In place of the high school conference, they'd like to visit high schools around the state to talk to Pacific Islander students.\n\nLike BSU, they've set up a fundraiser through GoFundMe, and they say anyone can reach out to their email at uofu.pisa1@gmail.com.\n\n\"We're doing the best we can for PISA and also future members who are going to come to the university,\" Tui said.\n\n'We will remain here'\n\nThe U. isn't the only school where clubs are being roped in under the new law's restrictions.\n\nAt Utah State University, student body President Matthew Richey said during a campus-wide forum last month that the new rules are \"not conducive\" to cultural clubs holding events any longer.\n\nPreviously, identity-based clubs that operated under USU's Inclusion Center received $1,000 annually. That money could be supplemented by fundraising, and groups could hold large events like Fiestas Americas or a Native powwow.\n\nNow -- with the closure of the Inclusion Center -- those clubs have been moved under the university's student association. No clubs there, said USU spokesperson Amanda DeRito, receive ongoing funding through the school.\n\n\"They can apply for funding each year in a case-by-case process,\" she said. \"This funding is limited to $500 per club per academic year and USUSA club funding cannot be used for food, travel, prizes or contracted speakers.\"\n\nIn place of the clubs, the school's new Center for the Study of Community, once it opens, will hold general cultural events open to anyone. At other schools, the impact was greater still. Weber State University closed all eight of its cultural centers.\n\nAt the U., both students and faculty have sent petitions to the administration calling for the new anti-diversity rules and center closures to be reversed.\n\n\"These centers were open to all students, but underrepresented students deserve to have named, visible support on campus,\" read the letter signed by more than 300 graduate students and undergraduates.\n\nThere has been no formal response from the university. Meanwhile, Werner said, a group she sees as antagonistic at the U. -- the conservative club Young Americans for Freedom -- continues to hold events, including ones that talk about race.\n\nYAF, which is registered and not sponsored, hosted a speaker on campus last month who has called DEI efforts \"modern day slavery of the mind.\"\n\n\"It's hurtful and degrading,\" Werner said.\n\nYAF drew attention last year after it held a showing of an anti-transgender film on campus. The student group Mecha, which is largely led by and for students of color at the U., stormed the room and shouted down the YAF speakers until the event had to be canceled.\n\nCampus police broke up the confrontation, arresting members of Mecha for infringing on YAF students' right to free speech. Several students in Mecha were later criminally charged. And the U. decided to pull the club's sponsorship, making it now, too, a registered student group.\n\nParker said that was part of what prompted Black Student Union leaders to make their own choice about cutting ties with the school -- rather than waiting for the university to do it or to add new rules or to force them to change their name.\n\nMecha also commented on BSU's post about leaving the U., writing: \"Solidarity! The university can try to shut down our spaces and resources but they can't shut down what we represent!\"\n\nParker agreed. \"We are here. And we will remain here,\" she said. \"We are the Black Student Union.\"\n\n(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Protesters chant as the crowd pushes inside the offices in the Union Building, during a sit-in, as the group Mecha stages a protest on the University of Utah Campus, on Wednesday, Nov. 15, 2023."

        "source": "The Guardian",
        "content": "Why is this simple explanation being so widely embraced? Because it does not require a commitment to real, structural change\n\nThe day that wokeness died. That has been one of the primary analyses of Donald Trump's resounding election victory: that it was a resounding rejection of the \"woke\" left and the casting off of the shackles of political correctness. According to sections of the media and political establishment, people are tired of being harangued and scolded for not using the right language, annoyed by a constant focus on race and identity, and alarmed by a new orthodoxy of radical politics eager to please individual groups at the expense of common sense. \"The era,\" summarised one British journalist, \"of Black Lives Matter, Latinx, critical race theory, pronouns and defunding the police is over.\" It's a neat conclusion - it's hard not to see this result as a rejection of something. But was that something \"woke\" values in particular?\n\nAs a starting point, it is worth looking at Kamala Harris's campaign rather than the assumptions about it. In reality, she seemed to avoid any focus on identity and \"wokeness\". She didn't make much of her race, or even her gender, choosing instead to ground her identity in her background as a middle-class person raised in a rental household by a hardworking mother. Her position on race softened from when she was running in 2019: she previously backed \"some form\" of reparations but did not stake out a position as part of her bid. Trump wanted Harris \"to say something to turn off white voters. She was wise not to take the bait,\" wrote the author Keith Boykin. She was hardline on immigration, keen to show that she is a gun owner (memorably telling Oprah Winfrey: \"If someone breaks into my house they're getting shot\"). And she was evasive on gender-affirming care for transgender Americans.\n\nAnd so this narrative of succumbing to \"Big Woke\", according to the American journalist Jack Mirkinson, \"bears virtually no resemblance to the actual campaign we all just suffered through\". Woke talking points were a key part not of Harris's campaign but of Trump's - he said that Harris suddenly \"became a Black person\" to capitalise on her race, and his campaign spent millions on ads about transgender rights. Welcome to the culture war - where only the right is really fighting, and the other side is helping it out by punching itself in the face.\n\nSo why are progressives so keen to take on this narrative, one that has even now migrated to the UK, where the US election result is seen as a cautionary tale? One reason is that it offers a simple culprit - and a mistake easy to avoid next time. It's far more straightforward to blame an abstract \"wokeness\" than to reckon with the fact that Harris ran a broadly right-of-centre campaign and still lost. It also conjures up a convenient voter, one who is more offended by language than by the promise of mass deportations. That then makes these voters retrievable rather than subject to big shifts, both of class dealignment and the transformation of parties formerly supported by the working classes into ones that attract higher-income voters.\n\nIt's also a big tell. The readiness to repudiate all forms of identity politics and group them under the \"bad woke\" umbrella is less about policy than about perception - social justice is seen as somehow tainting the liberal cause because, well, social justice is the stuff of scruffy radical activism, not upper-class power. Some of this is a broader backlash to a near-decade of breakthrough movements such as #MeToo and Black Lives Matter. But it also shows how these never really found a home in the Democratic party in a meaningful way and are seen only as a way to appeal to certain voting blocs. When those voters don't show up, this is seen as the fault of identity politics itself rather than the fact that it is pursued in ways that are shallow and entirely divorced from voters' lives.\n\nThere is an irony to all this. Because central to the lack of appeal of identity politics is its \"elite capture\" by exactly the sort of people who are now distancing themselves from it. Black Lives Matter is a case study. \"Allyship\" and \"doing the work\", buzzwords of the early 2020s, produced a frankly mortifying era in which white liberal politicians took the knee and this symbolic act took up an unbelievable amount of space in public discourse from sports to the media. \"Doing the work\" focused on interpersonal dynamics of racism rather than on structural ones. Diversity became about the visibility of people of colour and \"firsts\" separate from - and I apologise for this now fatally unfashionable synopsis - the broader systemic impact of this on poverty, poor public housing, unequal policing and access to health care. (Not that visibility and institutional reform are necessarily in competition, but only one pays dividends to white people.) Anything more gnarly, and crucially anything that engaged with demands and needs as expressed by Black activists who had been doing their own \"work\" for years, was roundly rejected. Discussions on policing became reduced to scoffing at the unrealistic ask of \"defunding the police\" rather than what that demand actually entailed, which, as even a cursory glance shows, is not to abolish policing but invest in preventive measures at the community level.\n\nEven then, I am not sure that this diluted vision has turned off voters to such an extent that it would drive them into the arms of Trump. But it does act as a reflection of a superficial and flaccid approach that has no edge or universal vision. This is particularly dangerous when there is no vividly defined unified and unifying policy for change, rendering a rightwing version of wokeness sharper and more compelling. In Mistaken Identity: Race and Class in the Age of Trump, the academic Asad Haider identifies the power of this missing universalism, one that is \"created and recreated in the act of insurgency\" against a system in which there are interlocking oppressions but only one common enemy. The power of identity politics doesn't lie in balkanisation - in carving up society into special interest groups in conflict with one other - but in precisely what its contemporary adoption seeks to prevent: the recognition that the common enemy is the way in which society itself is designed.\n\nIn short, the universal problem facing people of all identities in the US and the UK is hostility to those who lack capital in all it forms. To greater and lesser extents, our economies are based around social mobility rather than the ability to live in dignity without it, while ever-higher barriers to prosperity are erected and our public infrastructure is inadequate at almost every level. All the while, aggressive rightwing culture-war messaging is capitulated to because, to borrow from Yeats, liberals lack \"all conviction, while the worst/ Are full of passionate intensity\".\n\nIt's a useful diversion to pretend, and even believe, that dropping the use of Latinx, ditching pronouns or casting fewer Black people in Jaguar ads is the way forward. Yet these are no more than crises of confidence broadly confined to the same class of people who imagine they are relevant to millions outside it. The far more uncomfortable reality, one that demands we raise our game, is that elites created \"wokeness\" in their own image and have now created a fictional reality in which this patrician class fought valiantly for it and it failed because it's clearly just not what the people want.\n\nBut out in the real world, what the people want was never respected or advocated for with any leadership, consistency and conviction. The fight never started."

        "content": "A conversation with Lauren Chavez-Moreno, author of \"How Schools Make Race: Teaching Latinx Racialization in America.\"\n\nAs a former Spanish teacher, Lauren Chavez-Moreno often witnessed her students grappling with racial identity and cultural expectations in ways she wasn't fully prepared to address. Her students' comments and questions opened her eyes to the complexities of racialization within the school system. She recalls the challenges of navigating these moments, feeling the weight of her responsibility as an educator to address these issues thoughtfully.\n\nChavez-Moreno's new book, \"How Schools Make Race: Teaching Latinx Racialization in America,\" draws from these formative experiences, blending them with years of academic research to unpack how schools subtly shape racial identities, especially for Latinx students.\n\nThe book addresses sensitive issues, like the limitations placed on teachers in discussing race openly, the diversity (or lack thereof) within bilingual teaching staff, and the challenges faced by Latinx students in predominantly white school systems.\n\nChavez-Moreno's decision to avoid naming specific schools or states in her research highlights the universal nature of racialization in education. As she points out, the underlying process of racial identity formation is a nationwide phenomenon, not confined to any particular region. This broad perspective underscores the pervasiveness of racialization in shaping students' identities, an issue Chavez-Moreno believes requires urgent attention from educators, administrators, and policymakers alike.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThis book essentially covers the time when Donald Trump was elected president in 2016 and fast forward to now. The book is out and we live in a reality where Trump will be president again. So I simply want to ask you, what does the re-election of Donald Trump mean for this type of research and future work?\n\nI'm not really sure how I could answer that because it's still... I was walking yesterday, and I was trying to process, thinking, \"I can't believe this is happening again and worse.\" It's not going to be the same. It's going to be worse. I really don't know how to answer that, besides the fact that, like you mentioned, I was in classrooms in a Midwest swing state [in 2016] and heard things like students saying, \"Miss, I'm not coming tomorrow; I'm going to be deported.\" It's interesting because last week, I was in Arizona doing a research study, and exactly the same phrase was used. So, it's deeply saddening, and I haven't fully processed it.\n\nCould I add, though, being in the classrooms in Arizona versus being in the classrooms in the previous study in the Midwestern state, I feel like, can I go back to the other classrooms? Because in Arizona, teachers were basically forbidden. One of the teachers told me we were muzzled to talk to our students about the election. So there was a lot of fear, and that fear wasn't addressed, so there was this stifling silence in the schools.\n\nWhen I began reading the book, I thought this was going to be a message to teachers and their pedagogy and what things should and shouldn't be done in the classroom. But I found that your book isn't just about teacher pedagogy but rather how institutions shape these racial identities and social structures.\n\nThanks for noticing that the book isn't trying to dictate what teachers should or shouldn't do. It is about showing how, often in hidden ways, schooling institutions create these ideas about racial categories. But to clarify, I'm less focused on individual identity formation and more on the formation of groups. That's a key distinction.\n\nIn the book, you spend a significant portion defining terms like race, ethnicity and racialization. Why was it necessary to invest so much time in clarification?\n\nThat's kind of the business of academia. As scholars, we need to explain what we mean by terms instead of assuming shared understanding. For example, if I use the term \"Latinx\" without explanation, readers might misinterpret its meaning. Being explicit about concepts helps guide understanding, especially when dealing with theory. It's interesting that you notice that because that's actually something that I also advocate in my other work, for scholars to be clear about how they conceptualize specific terms and concepts.\n\n\"I was in classrooms in a Midwest swing state [in 2016] and heard things like students saying, \"Miss, I'm not coming tomorrow; I'm going to be deported.\" It's interesting because last week, I was in Arizona doing a research study, and exactly the same phrase was used.\"\n\nIn the book, you mentioned using \"Latinx\" for political reasons.\n\nSo, I first heard Latinx when I was a doctoral student, and I liked it because I saw it as a gift from the queer and trans communities to challenge the gender binary and patriarchy. As time went on, I started hearing people use \"Latine,\" but the reasons I heard for using \"Latine\" weren't very appealing to me. As I kept reading other authors and their interpretations of the \"X\" in Latinx, I came across Claudia Milian's book \"LatinX.\" In that book, she mentions that one of the meanings of the \"X\" could be crossing out \"Latin,\" a word rooted in colonialism and Europe. I loved that idea.\n\nThis distinction is crucial because racialization is highly context-specific. For example, in Guatemala, there is a racialized group called Ladino (not Latino). If someone who identifies as Ladino in Guatemala moves to the U.S., that label doesn't translate or hold the same meaning here. Similarly, someone from Latin America identifying as \"Latino\" might find that the U.S. context racializes the term differently, and it doesn't carry the same understanding.\n\nSo, when I use \"Latinx,\" it signals to my readers that I'm talking about a racialized group within the specific context of the U.S., not about Latin Americans as a whole. That's why the \"X\" is meaningful -- it serves as a marker of this distinction.\n\nDoes your use of \"Latinx\" come up in your teaching?\n\nOh, definitely. I've noticed a trend among my students where they often use \"Latine,\" and they're curious about why I use \"Latinx.\" I explain my reasons to them, but I make it clear: I'm not trying to convince or convert them to use \"Latinx.\" I tell them, \"This is why I use it, but it's totally fine if you choose to use something else in your work.\" It's something I bring up to share my perspective, but I emphasize that they're free to have their own reasons and use whichever term they prefer.\n\nYou obviously speak to educators and students but something I found particularly interesting is that you also address parents. I see this text as not only essential for educators but also potentially valuable for parents. What should parents know about how schools shape racial identities?\n\nI did interview parents for the study, and I noticed that parents had different ideas about what should be taught in schools -- which, of course, isn't surprising. But for teachers to engage in this kind of work, there needs to be community support and parents are a key part of that community. It's crucial to remember their role in supporting teachers as they undertake this work. By \"this type of work,\" I mean helping students develop critical racial consciousness and addressing questions about race explicitly. Schools, as I argue in the book, already teach about race in implicit ways. However, we must also engage with race explicitly, advancing anti-racist thinking and critically examining race as a construct. Parents' support is essential in fostering this kind of education.\n\nHow can parents advocate for a more equitable and inclusive education for their children?\n\nOne of the things I noticed in my study was a meeting, maybe \"Town Hall\" is too formal a term, between parents, students, and teachers of the bilingual program. They met on a Saturday morning to discuss the program's history, importance and challenges, as well as to hear from both students and parents. What struck me most was that parents were very adamant about teachers needing to be 100% bilingual and highly proficient in Spanish. Their focus was entirely on language proficiency. I also heard similar sentiments from students I interviewed, some of whom chose not to participate in the program. For example, one student said, \"I don't want to be in the program because my teacher pollutes my Spanish.\"\n\nI mention this example because, during that meeting, no parent brought up the importance of teachers developing students' critical consciousness. The focus was solely on language -- ensuring students learned English and spoke perfect Spanish. I think this emphasis stems from a stigma about students being viewed as \"pocho\" or not having perfect Spanish.\n\nTo answer your question about how parents can advocate, they should show up at these meetings and expand the conversation. Of course, they can express the importance of bilingualism, but they should also emphasize the need for teachers to develop student awareness of societal injustices and their critical consciousness. That would be a significant step forward.\n\nI was also intrigued by the makeup of the teachers you chose, or who were selected, and the very interesting group of people that emerged. One seemed almost overtly racist, and it was fascinating to see how race shaped their perspective. The gender makeup of the educators was also notable.\n\nOne of the things I found interesting was the very small number of Latino, Latina or Latinx teachers in the program. The program had 15 teachers across two schools that I observed. Not all of them participated in the study, but I believe it was around 12 or 13 who did. However, the majority of the teachers were white or self-identified as white, which stood out to me. It was notable that, in a bilingual program in a Midwestern state, the teaching staff was still predominantly white. I say \"still\" because this pattern was consistent with what I observed outside the program as well.\n\nAnother interesting point was who was leading lessons that challenged racism and addressed social justice. As I mentioned, there were very few Latinx teachers in my study, so I didn't have many opportunities to observe whether they would approach these topics differently. There was also an immigrant teacher from Spain who incorporated some of these ideas in their classroom.\n\nThis study wasn't designed to assess whether white teachers are more critically conscious than Latinx teachers. What I did notice, in terms of patterns, was that the teachers leading critical lessons were mostly white. That's why I don't find that particular observation especially compelling.\n\nWhy did you avoid naming specific schools or states in the book?\n\nThere are very few bilingual programs at the secondary level, especially in middle and high schools. That's why I didn't name the state but it's also something I realized after the fact. I also appreciate that choice because I wasn't just focusing on one specific place; I'm talking about something that happens in schools everywhere. All schools in the U.S., in my opinion, contribute to shaping ideas about race. Because schools are central in our racialized society, they maintain and sometimes challenge ideas about race. They can reinforce these ideas or offer new perspectives, but they shape how we think about racial groups. So, while I don't specify the state, school or city, I wanted to provide an example that helps us think about how this process works more broadly. It may not look exactly the same in every place, but if we think about how schools make race, it's helpful to recognize that this isn't just something that happens in one city. It could be anywhere in the U.S.\n\nWould that at all be influenced by the fact that, to me, it's interesting you say this can happen anywhere in the U.S., regardless of the specific makeup of a city or state? The immediate question that comes to mind is that not all cities and states are the same, and not all educators have the same demographic makeup. So, I'm kind of challenging that idea: what does it say about the institutions pushing for a more diverse group of educators and students? When you say this can happen anywhere, does that mean the work being done to increase diversity has a broader significance?\n\nWhat I mean by saying this can happen anywhere is not that the specifics are the same, but that the process of racialization happens everywhere. The making of race and the teaching of race occur everywhere. It's not about the particulars; it's about the broader process. I assume we live in a racialized society, so even if this were Alaska, Hawaii or Florida, the U.S. has undergone a process of racializing its groups. The specifics could vary, different states might have different laws or approaches, but schools are teaching about race, whether implicitly or explicitly. The lessons may differ, but they're still about race.\n\nFor example, a school that offers ethnic studies and takes an anti-colonial, anti-imperialist stance is still teaching about race, even if the content and perspective differ. So, when I say this process happens everywhere, I'm talking about the underlying similarity, not the exact details.\n\n\"...in Arizona, teachers were basically forbidden. One of the teachers told me we were muzzled to talk to our students about the election. So there was a lot of fear, and that fear wasn't addressed, so there was this stifling silence in the schools.\"\n\nI noticed that your educational background highlighted the importance of culturally relevant, race-conscious teaching. Why did your educational journey become so important to you that you wrote about it?\n\nMy background as an educator is shaped by political events in the U.S. For example, the banning of bilingual education in California and Arizona had a significant impact on me during my time as both a high school and undergraduate student. I had always planned to become a teacher, but at that point, I wasn't sure whether I wanted to teach history or Spanish. When bilingual education was banned in Arizona, it really solidified my decision to become a Spanish teacher. I saw the ban as an attack on immigrants and the Latinx community, and that made it clear to me which path I wanted to pursue.\n\nI saw language as a very important issue for the community, which is why I chose to teach Spanish. Even from that point, it was something that mattered deeply to me. But being a teacher also had a major influence on how I think about the book. When I was teaching, my students talked about race all the time, through jokes and casual comments, it was something that came up constantly. However, as a teacher, I didn't always know how to address it in a productive or helpful way. Sometimes, I felt like I was teaching concepts but not scaffolding my students' thinking effectively. I'd either move too slowly or too quickly, and I wasn't prepared to teach about these complex issues. As many people know, these are very sensitive and taboo topics, and you can get into a lot of trouble if you don't handle them correctly. It takes a lot of bravery as a teacher, and sometimes I made big mistakes. But these experiences were also formative for me and helped shape how I think about these issues.\n\nI want to focus on the recommendations you make in the conclusion of your book, particularly when you discuss embracing theory. I found it insightful when you mention that individual teachers don't have all the answers. This really resonated with me because it highlights the vulnerability of educators and how that can be an asset.\n\nOne teacher I really admired shared that she knew she didn't have all the answers, but she wanted to explore the issues with her students, and I truly admired that. It takes a lot of courage, and she was a very brave educator. Many of her lessons were meaningful to her students. I believe teachers can support each other by collaborating and sharing ideas for these kinds of lessons. I'm a strong advocate for taking an inquiry stance in teaching, which helps educators improve their own practices. I learned this approach from Professor Marilyn Cochran-Smith and her work with Susan Lytle. It involves teachers being systematic and intentional about examining their teaching in collaboration with others, looking at student work, discussing how to challenge students and exploring ways to expand their thinking.\n\nThe best teacher preparation, in my opinion, focuses on helping teachers feel supported and confident enough to take risks in the classroom. Vulnerability in teaching often means taking risks, so to foster this, teachers need ample support and proper training.\n\nYou can buy a copy of \"How Schools Make Race: Teaching Latinx Racialization in America\" here."

        "content": "The national furor in recent years around banning books on race and gender in public schools is intensifying as President-elect Donald Trump threatens to shut down the Department of Education, emboldening conservatives to end \"wokeness\" in classrooms.\n\nBattles over books in school libraries have become emblematic of the country's larger culture wars over race, historical revisionism and gender identity. A new report by PEN America found book bans increased by nearly 200% during the 2023-24 school year, including titles on sexuality, substance abuse, depression and other issues students face in an age of accelerating technologies, climate change, toxic politics and fears about the future.\n\nBook censorship has shaken and divided school boards, pitted parents against parents, and led to threats against teachers and librarians. It is part of an agenda driven by conservative parental rights groups and politicians who promote charter schools and voucher systems that could weaken public education. The issue goes to the heart not only of what students are taught but how federal and state education policies will affect the nation's politics after one of the most consequential elections in its history.\n\n\"It's not just about taking a book off a shelf,\" said Tasslyn Magnusson, an author and teacher from Wisconsin who tracks book censorship across the U.S. \"It's about power and who controls public education. It's about what kind of America we were and are. We're trying to define what family is and what America means. That comes down to the stories we tell.\"\n\nShe said she feared Trump's return to the White House would further incite those calling for book bans: \"I don't have lots of hope. It could get a lot worse.\"\n\nOver the last year, PEN counted more than 10,000 book bans nationwide that targeted 4,231 unique titles. Most were books dealing with gender, sexuality, race and LGBTQ+ storylines. The most banned title was Jodi Picoult's \"Nineteen Minutes,\" about a school shooting that included a short description of date rape. Florida and Iowa -- both of which have strict regulations on what students can read -- accounted for more than 8,200 bans in the 2023-24 school year.\n\n\"This crisis is tragic for young people hungry to understand the world they live in and see their identities and experiences reflected in books,\" Kasey Meehan, director of PEN's Freedom to Read Program, said in a statement. \"What students can read in schools provides the foundation for their lives.\"\n\nTrump's calls to close the Department of Education would need congressional approval, which appears unlikely. Although public schools are largely funded and governed by state and local institutions, the department helps pay to educate students with disabilities, provides about $18 billion in grants for K-12 schools in poor communities and oversees a civil rights branch to protect students from discrimination.\n\nBut Trump's election has inspired conservative parental groups, including Moms For Liberty and Parents Defending Education, to strengthen efforts to limit what they see as a liberal conspiracy to indoctrinate children with books and teachings that are perverse, amoral and pornographic.\n\nTiffany Justice, co-founder of Moms for Liberty, has criticized schools that she says spend too much time on diversity and inclusion when only about one-third of U.S. children are reading at grade level: \"We're talking about public school libraries and content for kids,\" Justice told NewsNation after Trump's victory. \"I think it's very clear that there are certain things that are appropriate for kids, certain things that are appropriate for adults. We're just getting back to commonsense America.\"\n\nTrump's threat to deny federal funding to schools that acknowledge transgender identities could affect curricula and the kinds of books school libraries stock. During his rally at Madison Square Garden in October, Trump -- who has has accused schools of promoting sex change operations -- said his administration would get \"transgender insanity the hell out of our schools.\" Vice President-elect JD Vance has accused Democrats of wanting to \"put sexually explicit books in toddlers' libraries.\"\n\nNicole Neily, president of Parents Defending Education, told Newsmax that she was excited about Trump's calls to remake education and \"clean up a lot of the mess\" he has inherited from the Biden administration. Trump \"has centered parental rights back in his platform, which is incredible. He has prioritized knowledge and skill, not identity politics,\" she said. \"American children deserve better, and it is time for change.\"\n\nIn nominating Linda McMahon to be his secretary of Education, Trump appears to be pushing for more conservative parental control over what is taught and read in classrooms. A former professional wrestling executive, McMahon chairs the America First Policy Institute, a Trump-connected organization that has criticized schools for teaching \"racially divisive\" theories, notably about slavery and a perspective about the nation's founding it views as anti-American.\n\n\"Today's contentious debates over using classrooms for political activism rather than teaching a complete and accurate account of American history have reinvigorated calls for greater parental and citizen involvement in the curriculum approval process,\" the institute's website says.\n\nCulturally divisive issues, including race and LGBTQ+ themes, cost school districts an estimated $3.2 billion during the 2023-24 school year, according to a recent study called \"The Costs of Conflict.\" The survey -- published by the Institute for Democracy, Education and Access at UCLA -- found that battles over books and teaching about sexuality and other topics led to increased expenses for legal fees, replacing administrators and teachers who quit, and security, including off-duty plainclothes police officers.\n\n\"Are we really going to spend our tax dollars on these kinds of things?\" asked Magnusson. \"After Trump was elected, I saw a bunch of middle-class white ladies like me who were saying, 'This isn't America.' But maybe it is America.\"\n\nOne school superintendent in a Western state told the study's researchers that his staff was often consumed with correcting misinformation and fulfilling public record requests mainly from hard-line parental rights activists attempting to exploit cultural war issues to discredit the district. \"Our staff are spending enormous amounts of time just doing stupid stuff,\" the superintendent said. \"The fiscal costs to the district are enormous, but [so are] the cultural costs of not standing up to the extremists. If someone doesn't, then the students and employees lose. ... It's the worst it's ever been.\"\n\nThe survey found that 29% of 467 school superintendents interviewed reported that teachers and other staff quit their profession or left their districts \"due to culturally divisive conflict.\"\n\nCensoring books in school libraries grew out of opposition to COVID-19 restrictions. A number of conservative parental groups, including Moms for Liberty, which invited Trump to speak at its national convention in August, turned their attention to lobbying against \"liberal indoctrination.\" Their protests against what they criticized as progressive teaching on sexuality and race were focused on increasing conservative parental control over a public education system that was struggling at teaching children reading and math.\n\nThat strategy has led to a national, right-wing effort that is \"redefining government power to restrict access to information in our schools,\" said Stephana Ferrell, co-founder of the Florida Freedom to Read Project. \"This movement to protect the innocence of our children believes if children never read it in a book they won't have to know about it and can go on to lead harmonious lives. But books teach us cautionary tales. They instruct us. You can't protect innocence through ignorance.\"\n\nSchool districts across the country have removed \"Gender Queer\" by Maia Kobabe and \"All Boys Aren't Blue\" by George Johnson, which are about gender identity and include graphic depictions of sex, along with titles by renowned writers such as Toni Morrison, Kurt Vonnegut, George Orwell, Maya Angelou and Flannery O'Connor.\n\nSurveys show that most Americans do not favor censorship. The Florida Freedom to Read Project and similar organizations around the country have called for thorough public reviews of challenged books to prevent one scene or passage from being taken out of context. Moderate and liberal parents groups over the last two years have also become more active in school board politics. They have supported school board candidates who have defeated those backed by Moms for Liberty in Texas, Florida and other states.\n\n\"People say the pendulum will swing back,\" said Ferrell. But, she said, conservatives want to \"stop the pendulum from swinging back.\"\n\nPicoult is accustomed to conservatives attempting to censor her. Her books have been banned in schools in more than 30 states. Published in 2007, \"Nineteen Minutes\" explores the lives of characters, including a girl who was raped, in a town leading up to a school shooting and its aftermath.\n\n\"Having the most banned book in the country is not a badge of honor. It's a call for alarm,\" said Picoult, whose books have sold more than 40 million copies. \"My book, and the 10,000 others that have been pulled off school library shelves this year, give kids a tool to deal with an increasingly divided and difficult world. These book banners aren't helping children. They are harming them.\"\n\n©2024 Los Angeles Times. Visit at latimes.com. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC."

        "content": "Responding to an indictment filed in New York that alleges that 11 Bahamians, including members of the security forces, conspired to import cocaine into the United States, Prime Minister Philip Davis today vowed that the \"betrayal will not go unanswered\".\n\nThe indictment, which was unsealed yesterday, names Chief Superintendent Elvis Curtis, officer-in-charge of the Airport Division, Royal Bahamas Police Force (RBPF) Sergeant Prince Albert Symonette, who works closely with Curtis, and Royal Bahamas Defence Force (RBDF) Chief Petty Officer Darrin Roker as conspirators who helped facilitate the transshipment of tons of cocaine from South America through The Bahamas and ultimately into the United States.\n\nDuring a communication in the House of Assembly, Davis said the revelations strike at the \"core of who we are as a nation\".\n\n\"Madam Speaker, this House and the Bahamian people deserve answers,\" he said.\n\n\"The government of The Bahamas will act decisively to ensure that those responsible for these breaches, regardless of rank or position, are held accountable. This betrayal will not go unanswered.\n\n\"In light of these serious allegations, I want to assure this House and the Bahamian people that my government will act swiftly and decisively. We will engage with our U.S. partners and assist fully in this investigation.\n\n\"The defendants will have their day in court, where the guilt or innocence of each will be established. But we cannot wait - and we will not wait - for the outcomes of court proceedings in the United States.\n\n\"We are going to use every resource - and consider every option - so that Bahamians can trust those who take an oath to protect them. This is essential. Everything is on the table. We will have change, we will have reform, and we will have action.\"\n\nThe indictment alleges that Curtis, who supervises airport locations throughout The Bahamas, including Lynden Pindling International Airport, the country's largest airport, abused his position in exchange for \"cocaine-fueled bribes from drug traffickers and their confederates\".\n\nIt is alleged that Curtis helped to \"facilitate the transportation of narcotics and drug-trafficking proceeds, by, among other things, providing safe passage for the traffickers and their cocaine loads through Nassau airport and elsewhere in The Bahamas\".\n\nThe indictment alleges that in or about September 2024, Curits told a trafficker that, \"...In exchange for $2 million USD, a high-ranking Bahamian politician, whom Curtis named, would authorize the assistance and involvement of Bahamian law enforcement officials -- including RBPF officers -- in facilitating cocaine shipments...\".\n\nThe prime minister said he has directed the minister of foreign affairs to issue a diplomatic note requesting further details about allegations involving a high ranking Bahamian politician. Such allegations demand thorough investigation, and no stone will be left unturned in seeking the truth.\n\n\"Today I have requested a meeting with the charge d'Affaires of the United States Embassy to discuss these findings and reaffirm our government's commitment to full cooperation in uncovering the truth and dismantling these criminal networks,\" Davis continued.\n\n\"Additionally, I will meet with the leadership of the Royal Bahamas Police Force and the Royal Bahamas Defence Force to discuss the allegations detailed in the indictment. The leadership of these organizations must understand the gravity of this moment and the immediate need to restore the integrity of our institutions.\n\n\"Madam Speaker, our security forces must demonstrate that they are prepared to uphold the highest standards of professionalism and accountability.\"\n\nThe prime minister also vowed to bring new legislation to Parliament aimed at strengthening oversight of the conduct and operations of law enforcement agencies.\n\n\"This legislation will ensure that no individual or institution is above accountability,\" he said. \"It will provide mechanisms to prevent corruption, establish clear checks and balances, and empower independent bodies to investigate and act when breaches occur.\"\n\n\"The indictment brought forward yesterday reveals a breach so deep that it strikes at the heart of our national security.\n\n\"...We are at a critical juncture in our nation's history -- a moment of accountability.\n\nThe misconduct of a few must not and will not define The Bahamas.\"\n\nThe indictment alleges that since at least in or about May 2021, corrupt high ranking members of the RBPF and other Bahamian government officials have worked with Colombian and Bahamian drug traffickers to facilitate the receipt, protection and safe passage of massive cocaine shipments through the airports and ports of The Bahamas.\n\nThe prime minister said on at least three occasions, and as recent as earlier this year, he raised concerns with senior members of US enforcement and intelligence over the sharp uptick in the flow of cocaine through The Bahamas.\n\n\"For more than three years, it has pieced together evidence that paints a damning picture of collusion and corruption,\" Davis said.\n\n\"Let there be no doubt: the Bahamian people deserve accountability for every act of betrayal committed during this time. The tree will be shaken until every bad apple falls.\n\n\"To those who believe they can outsmart the systems of justice and intelligence, let this serve as a clear and stern warning: the days of operating in the shadows are over. You will be found, and you will be held accountable.\""

        "content": "Roman Reigns is rumored to battle The Rock or Cody Rhodes at WWE WrestleMania 41. However, wrestling analyst Sam Roberts suggested the Original Tribal Chief could go head-to-head with another superstar at The Show of Shows in Las Vegas following a potential betrayal.\n\nAfter struggling to find a fifth member for the upcoming Men's WarGames Match, Paul Heyman returned on last week's SmackDown after five months of absence to save the OG Bloodline, introducing CM Punk as the final addition to Team Roman. However, The Wiseman's outfit led many to speculate that he could betray the Original Tribal Chief and side with Solo Sikoa, as the 59-year-old dressed similarly to how The Street Champion used to dress after he took over The Bloodline earlier this year.\n\nWhile Roberts acknowledged on his Notsam Wrestling podcast that Heyman could betray Reigns for Sikoa, the 41-year-old pointed out that the potential betrayal could lead to the OTC facing his former Enforcer at the 2025 Royal Rumble and Jacob Fatu at WrestleMania 41.\n\n\"If Paul Heyman were to align with the new Bloodline, I don't think you would even have to question if a Roman Reigns [vs.] Solo Sikoa match could headline a major pay-per-view [PLE], be it at Saturday Night's Main Event [sic], a Royal Rumble, or even a WrestleMania,\" he said.\n\nThe RAW Talk host added:\n\n\"Or if a Solo Sikoa [vs.] Roman Reigns match could headline a Royal Rumble, a Jacob Fatu [vs.] Roman Reigns match could headline a WrestleMania. If Paul Heyman is on that team, and that betrayal is taking place, I don't think that's to be questioned.\" [27:20-27:54]\n\nSam Roberts thinks Roman Reigns can also face a top WWE star after Survivor Series: WarGames\n\nAfter taking out the new Bloodline at the end of WWE SmackDown last Friday, Roman Reigns and CM Punk had a brief face-off. While the two WWE Superstars will join forces this Saturday at Survivor Series: WarGames, Sam Roberts claimed their alliance would not last long.\n\nOn a previous edition of his Notsam Wrestling podcast, Roberts suggested the company was planting seeds for a future encounter between the Original Tribal Chief and The Best in The World by having them on the same team.\n\n\"The idea that we're gonna see Roman Reigns and CM Punk on the same team, which only plants seeds for a future match between Roman Reigns and CM Punk, is so, like, the minute you see those guys together and realize that it's all right there in front of you. You've got two years of stories right there in front of us,\" he said.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what the creative team has in store for Roman Reigns after the OG Bloodline vs. the new Bloodline WarGames Match at WWE Survivor Series: WarGames."

As a result, Haruka is given the remaining skills that no one else chose, leaving him with a wide array of abilities, but none that seem particularly powerful.\n\nDespite lacking a single remarkable skill, Haruka adapts to his new life in the other world by making the most of the abilities he has.\n\nHe embraces his new reality and lives comfortably, away from the chaotic lives of his classmates.\n\nHaruka enjoys his peaceful, solitary existence, free from the burdens of being a hero and dealing with the conflicts that arise in this strange world.\n\nWith his variety of skills, he quickly builds a stable and content life, focusing on his own well-being rather than taking on any leadership roles.\n\nHowever, things begin to change when Haruka's classmates start to struggle with the challenges of their new environment.\n\nThey are faced with difficult situations, such as adapting to the unfamiliar world, mastering their powers, and dealing with conflicts that arise among them.\n\nAs they try to handle their roles as heroes, the students find themselves overwhelmed by the pressures of their new responsibilities and the growing tension between them.\n\nAt this point, Haruka is forced to reconsider his solitary life. The struggles of his classmates draw him out of his comfort zone, and he realizes that he cannot continue to ignore the chaos around him.\n\nAlthough Haruka initially chose to be a loner, he comes to understand that he has the ability to help his classmates and play a more active role in the new world.\n\nThis marks the beginning of his transformation from a quiet, isolated student into someone who is willing to take on greater responsibilities for the sake of others.\n\nAs Haruka steps up to assist his classmates, he uses his wide range of skills to solve problems and ease their struggles.\n\nHis abilities, while not flashy or powerful on their own, become invaluable when combined strategically.\n\nHaruka's natural talent for problem-solving and his practical use of magic and skills make him an unlikely yet effective hero.\n\nThough he remains humble and avoids seeking attention, his actions begin to earn the respect of his classmates, who begin to rely on him more.\n\nIn the end, Haruka's journey is one of growth, not only as he helps his classmates handle the challenges of the other world but also as he learns to break free from his isolation.\n\nHe slowly becomes more involved with the group and finds his place among them, realizing that sometimes, even those who prefer to be alone are needed by others.\n\nHis story shows that even the quietest individuals can make a significant impact when they choose to step out of the shadows and lend a helping hand.\n\nLet This Grieving Soul Retire! tells the story of Krai Andrey, a 20-year-old treasure hunter who, despite his fame, longs for a quiet, peaceful life away from danger and expectations.\n\nKrai's journey started with a youthful promise to become a legendary treasure hunter alongside his friends, but reality soon struck.\n\nWhile his friends excelled and grew stronger, Krai realized he wasn't cut out for the treasure-hunting lifestyle.\n\nYet, due to his leadership role in the Grieving Souls party, his life remained entangled with dangerous expeditions and high-risk missions that he never asked for.\n\nWhile he is known for his almost invincible defensive abilities and godlike foresight, Krai is not a skilled fighter and is often the weakest member of his group.\n\nThough Krai is weak in terms of stats, his unique talents especially his ability to use defective relics -- have earned him the respect of his party members.\n\nHe is often seen as a strategic genius who can complete difficult missions with a perfect success rate, but his personal goal has always been to retire from the life of a treasure hunter.\n\nHe never wanted to be the leader of the Grieving Souls, nor did he seek the fame or recognition that came with it.

        "content": "Comment: Tomorrow Prime Minister Christopher Luxon will apologise to thousands of people who were abused when they were in the custody of the state.\n\nFor many survivors it will be hugely important to hear a Prime Minister acknowledge what they went through was wrong and apologise.\n\nBut those words will be rendered hollow if the Crown's response does not follow through on the words.\n\nLuxon surprised a number of people, myself included, when the Royal Commission's final report was tabled in July by acknowledging that the abuse suffered by hundreds of children at the Lake Alice adolescent unit in the 1970s was torture. And he said sorry.\n\nFor over 50 years successive governments have avoided facing up to the full reality and responsibility of what happened not only at Lake Alice but in a number of state institutions. So Luxon's words were a breakthrough.\n\nThe Lake Alice case is something of benchmark, not only because it was one of the worst cases of institutional abuse but because it was the first case where victims took civil cases against the Crown and the Crown did its utmost to avoid accountability.\n\nIn 2002 victims were paid out around $100,000 but many of them lost around 40 percent of that in legal fees that should have been paid by the Crown. That is now going to be paid out, but without any additional interest or calculations for inflation.\n\nBut now the Government is in a position to provide something substantive to victims not only of Lake Alice but to the thousands who went through state institutions.\n\nThe out-of-court settlement was ex gratia, which is the Crown saying it's a gift rather than compensation, thereby avoiding any legal liability. Will this government couch any settlement in the same way?\n\nAnd what should the Crown be paying out to victims who went through torture?\n\nI'll get to the numbers. But throughout my coverage of state abuse there have always been two parts to the story that I've tried to emphasise.\n\nFirst, the abuse itself, which is terrible enough on its own.\n\nBut then there was the institutional cover-up and failure to protect children or hold perpetrators accountable. This extended to individuals and institutions deliberately covering up crimes committed by the Crown. This isn't just my view.\n\nThe Royal Commission made these statements in its final report: \"Political and public service leaders spent time, energy and taxpayer resources to hide, cover up and then legally fight survivors to protect the potential perceived costs to the Crown, and their own reputations.\"\n\n\"Successive Government ministers and heads of government agencies who were responsible for the law and policy settings had accountabilities in law to children, young people and adults in their care that they failed to uphold.\"\n\nWhile the report extensively documents the abuse of children, it also goes into detail about how the Crown responded over decades. I attempted to distil this in a five-part series that included other documents from my own research.\n\nLuxon's apology will be only as good as the Government's willingness to hold those accountable who were involved in this cover-up. To date his government has shown no such willingness.\n\nI asked Luxon's office specific questions on this including the following:\n\n- is it appropriate for Judith Collins to hold the role of Attorney General when she denied on behalf of New Zealand that we didn't commit state torture in New Zealand, particularly when she had access to copious evidence that said otherwise? Una Jagose admitted at the Royal Commission that what happened at Lake Alice met the definition of torture and that the Crown had always known because it was in the file, the same files Judith Collins had access to when she was Minister of Justice. The Police admitted at the Royal Commission that their investigation was a failure, an investigation that concluded when Judith Collins was Minister of Police. The Attorney General holds the power to decide whether charges should be laid under the Crimes of Torture Act, a power the UN has criticised, and holds the power to veto Article 14 which is about redress. The UN has also criticised this. And yet we have an Attorney General who has denied New Zealand commits torture when you have admitted, as Prime Minister, that we have.\n\n- Is it appropriate for the Una Jagose to retain the position of Solicitor General when Crown Law withheld evidence from Police in 2020? She has also withheld evidence from lawyers representing victims and victims themselves. This is all laid out in my series. It bears repeating that the allegations made by victims were not only credible, they were criminal. Crown Law knew this. Jagose was also involved in the White case, where the Crown denied the victim's allegations, despite being aware that one of the main perpetrators had convictions for sexually assaulting children at Hokio Beach School. The whole purpose of the Crown's defence in the White case was to thwart any attempt by thousands of victims to obtain redress for the crimes committed against them\n\nI know victims want to see accountability. Will the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General be held fully accountable for their past involvement?\n\nTo date I have received no response. By his silence Luxon has implicitly aligned himself with the actions of the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General.\n\nHe can't apologise to victims for the abuse they suffered, but then allow those who wronged those victims by the Crown's continued denials and cover-up to continue in their positions.\n\nIf Luxon fails to impose any consequences on Judith Collins and Una Jagose for their involvement, then it won't be an apology but an insult to add to years of insult.\n\nI asked the Minister of Justice, Paul Goldsmith, some questions too, including, his view on some of the statements made by Justice Miller (now on the Supreme Court) in a test case known as the White Case in 2007. I asked Goldsmith whether he had: \"given any thought to legislating to annul the judgment in the White Case?\"\n\n\"Is the minister comfortable with the comments by Justice Forrest Miller in that judgment where he found that although Earl White had been sexually assaulted at least 13 times as a child while at Hokio Beach School, that this sexual abuse was \"embarrassing for him, but not traumatic\"?\n\n\"Does the Minister believe this decision should continue to stand as case law which prevents thousands of victims of state violence against children from obtaining proper redress that is determined by the courts and not the government departments that are responsible for the abuse?\"\n\nI received the following response from Goldsmith's office: \"Ministers are prohibited from commenting on any specific court cases or decisions. Therefore, the minister will not be commenting.\"\n\nHowever, Goldsmith has been happy to give his view on other court decisions, and to intervene to change them if he and the Government sees fit. In a Waitangi Tribunal report about Goldsmith's proposed amendments to legislation regarding customary title to the foreshore and seabed, Goldsmith told Cabinet \"that the Crown considers the courts in Re Edwards (High Court and Court of Appeal) incorrectly interpreted the test\". The Tribunal found Goldsmith did not provide any credible evidence to back up his argument, ignored advice to the contrary from government officials and could not justify his position with anything other than his opinion.\n\nI asked questions of the Minister of Police, Mark Mitchell, when he first came into office about a police complaint by Lake Alice victims about obstruction of justice. I asked Mitchell: \"I wonder if the minister could explain why the police have been so tardy to respond to a criminal complaint on these matters.\"\n\nI haven't received a response.\n\nLuxon had no option but to acknowledge the torture finding - the Royal Commission had made a finding of torture; the UN found New Zealand in breach of the Convention Against Torture; a Court of Appeal upheld a High Court decision that referred to what happened at Lake Alice as torture. The decades-long denial and obfuscation by the Crown had finally run into the truth.\n\nThere was no way Luxon could dispute the Royal Commission finding - it was partly based on evidence from the Solicitor General Una Jagose admitting that what happened to children at Lake Alice met the definition of torture. She also admitted that the Crown had always known that what happened was not medical treatment because it was in the file.\n\nBut the Crown has still been stalling and trying to find ways to avoid the consequences of that admission. After more than 50 years of the Crown trying to avoid liability for what happened at Lake Alice and many other state institutions where children were abused, now the Crown has shifted tactics.\n\nA survivor advisory group was finally told by bureaucrats that the Crown would not dispute the Royal Commission's finding of torture regarding Lake Alice, after being constantly asked. They were also told they could not disclose this to people outside the advisory group, but this imposed secrecy was never explained. But there was a request from victims for independent legal advice to try and understand the legal implications of this admission. That request was denied, despite this announcement having massive legal consequences.\n\nThere are indications that Crown lawyers and officials are still playing games in the background.\n\nA Cabinet paper in July this year said:\n\n\"The Government's acknowledgment that some survivors of the Lake Alice Unit experienced torture, as described in this paper, does not create any new liability on the Crown to provide redress.\"\n\nThis would have been the basis for Luxon's frankness about torture when the Royal Commission's final report landed. But lawyers I've spoken to say the legal basis for this statement in the Cabinet paper is dubious.\n\nThe Cabinet paper's statement was also made before Education Minister Erica Stanford, who is also the coordinating minister for the Crown's response to victims, met Lake Alice survivors.\n\nStanford met Lake Alice victims on the day the Royal Commission report was tabled in Parliament and was quickly on the back-foot when the victims were raising questions about legal obligations under the UN, including the Istanbul Protocol, and New Zealand's Crimes of Torture Act.\n\nStanford appeared blindsided because officials hadn't briefed her on these obligations, even though the victims had raised them with the same government officials over months.\n\nThe Cabinet paper's blasé attitude towards further legal liability was unravelling. It has also delayed the Government's objective to have a redress package in front of Lake Alice survivors by the time the apology was delivered.\n\nStanford was again embarrassed when she found out (through my reporting) that the person appointed to the position of chief executive of the Crown Response Unit, Rajesh Chhana, had previously been involved in appearing before the UN on the matter of torture in his role at the Ministry of Justice. Stanford is understood to have stipulated to officials that she didn't want anyone who had previous involvement in dealing with state abuse.\n\nNew Zealand had long been obfuscating on its response to the UN about Lake Alice and the UN had repeatedly pressed the New Zealand government to take action on its obligations. When the UN found New Zealand in breach of the Convention Against Torture in 2019, the actions of many of those concerned, including the previous Prime Minister Helen Clark, Judith Collins, Rajesh Chhana and a number of others, were in question. The finding of torture by the Royal Commission reinforced that.\n\nSurvivors I have spoken to have a high regard for Stanford and believe she is working hard to do the right thing by them. But they retain a high level of distrust for those who are advising her, and for very good reasons. Many are tainted, even if it's only by association.\n\nBut Stanford continues to have to rely on this advice and this advice is repeatedly being exposed as faulty. I've been told that Stanford has requested legal advice outside Crown Law but this is being blocked by Collins.\n\nCollins had denied New Zealand committed state torture in front of the UN in 2014 when she was Minister of Justice - so why is she not recusing herself from this matter now?\n\nAt the time she made that denial she would have had access to a mountain of evidence gathered over the previous two decades that pointed to torture. Her colleague and Attorney-General at the time Chris Finlayson had acknowledged in a letter to lawyer Sonja Cooper that the Lake Alice allegations were verified and were not acceptable practice for the day. So Collins was denying facts in an international legal forum.\n\nFurthermore, New Zealand has expressed a reservation on Article 14 of the Convention Against Torture, which is about redress. Instead, the Attorney-General has veto powers over Article 14, a structural flaw the UN has repeatedly criticised because the Attorney-General sits within Cabinet. That theoretical flaw is now a reality, but is also amplified by Collins' previous denial of torture at the UN. Which means Judith Collins has the final say over redress for torture at Lake Alice when she has previously denied it happened at all.\n\nBut Collins' denial was part of a decades-long pattern that is spelled out in the Royal Commission's report and in the reporting I've done over the past eight years.\n\nThe impact of this ongoing denial and cover-up has a name - betrayal trauma. Jennifer Freyd, Professor of Psychology at Oregon University, coined the term to describe and diagnose the trauma that is experienced by victims when they are victimised again by the denial of the original abuse by someone in power. That denial can also be an institutional betrayal. The denial and all the institutional behaviour that goes with it is not only an abuse of power, it is a separate, additional form of abuse that compounds and prolongs the original trauma. The failure of institutions to do what they are morally and legally required inflicts further harm on victims.\n\nFreyd made an observation about religious organisations that also applies to state entities: \"Prioritising damage control rather than addressing an underlying problem with abuse has characterized the cases of systemic abuse.\" This pretty much sums up what has been going on in New Zealand for decades.\n\nLuxon's apology cannot be limited only to the original abuse, a past tense sorrow for events in the distant past that no one supposedly knew about. There are people in high level offices still who are tied to the institutional betrayal of victims because they knew what the facts were but their offices or agencies proceeded to act in ways that were about protecting the Crown from legal and financial liability.\n\nParliament was part of this betrayal. A number of Members of Parliament were responsible for the response to victims when they came forward as adults and asked for accountability either through the courts or through direct contact with the ministries concerned.\n\nThe Police were part of this betrayal. They repeatedly failed to investigate crimes against children committed by state employees, despite repeated requests and an abundance of evidence. The failure was so bad they had to apologise to Lake Alice victims at the Royal Commission hearing. They have yet to investigate those who obstructed their investigations or withheld information.\n\nThe media was and is part of this betrayal. When I first started covering this issue, I did a Google trawl to see what previous media coverage there had been. And there were intermittent stories over decades, and many of them were very good journalism. But I also noticed a pattern. There would be one or two stories that would be published or broadcast in a flurry of coverage, and then the media attention would peter out and nothing substantive would change for the victims.\n\nHow is it that there can be hundreds of thousands of children abused by state institutions over decades and the media's coverage is intermittent at best? Is it because many of these victims then end up being marginalised as adults, ie. they end up in gangs and jail, and are therefore vilified by the media rather than perceived as victims? Is it because the majority are Maori and those who aren't are poor or disadvantaged Pakeha, and therefore are of no real interest to white middle-class journalists and editors? Is it because the media's relationship with politicians and the institutions they are supposed to hold to account is far too cosy?\n\nBut if I had to single out one institution within the Crown that has completely betrayed victims then the clear winner is Crown Law. This institution holds the authority for prosecuting crimes, and yet its actions over decades have contributed to what the Royal Commission labels a \"cover-up\" of crimes and injustice for survivors.\n\nSo what should the Lake Alice victims be compensated? The question matters not just for Lake Alice victims but sets the bar for other victims of state abuse and potentially for future victims, which is what the Crown was worried about all along.\n\nIn one case in Australia Bob Cummings, former ward of the state of Victoria, was forced to undergo electric shock \"therapy\" after disclosing he had been sexually abused in the early 1970s. He reached an $825,000 settlement with the state government and Uniting Church in 2020. A story in The Age newspaper said that Mr Cummings accepted an earlier settlement of $15,000 in 2007 that he considered \"insulting\" and was prevented from pursuing any further claims. But a law change allowed him to revisit the settlement.\n\nVictorian Attorney-General Jill Hennessy said, for too long, survivors of institutional child sexual abuse had \"been forced to accept measly payments for the horrendous injustices they suffered\".\n\nThat statement applies squarely to New Zealand. It's a pity our Attorney-General didn't come out and say the same.\n\nLuxon's statement to the point is already subtly minimising the torture, using words like \"some children\" and only referring to the use of electric shocks and the painful drug paraldehyde. But what about children who were not only given electric shocks, but were deliberately put into adult villas where they were raped by criminally insane patients? (I have documents that corroborates that this happened). Some of the staff doing this were also sexually abusing and raping children, often when they were administering paraldehyde. Others were put into a cage with deranged adult patients as punishment and to frighten other children. This was verified by Justice Gallen in 2002.\n\nDoes the Crown now consider this treatment to be torture? What about solitary confinement of children for months - is that torture? All of these forms of abuse were given as a punishment and therefore meet the definition of torture. Luxon has no doubt been advised to limit what he says about this.\n\nIt should be noted that New Zealand is still in breach of the Convention Against Torture, particularly on Article 14 which is about providing proper redress. The Convention doesn't define specifics on what redress should look like.\n\nI'm hearing a figure of billions of dollars has been earmarked for redress for state abuse. If that's in the ballpark, then it's a significant figure. But compared to the calculation that the Royal Commission made of the estimated monetary cost, then it's a small fraction.\n\nThe Royal Commission estimated the cost: \"The average lifetime cost to the survivor of the loss of enjoyment of things that New Zealanders consider are normal day‑to‑day activities is estimated to be approximately $857,000. Based on the estimated number of people abused and neglected in care between 1950 and 2019, the total cost is estimated to be between $96 billion and $217 billion, of which the smallest proportion is paid by the taxpayers of New Zealand, up to $46.7 billion. The largest cost, estimated up to $172 billion, is borne by survivors.\"\n\nLike the Treaty of Waitangi settlements, the true cost is absorbed by the victims themselves while the Crown portrays itself as generous and magnanimous.\n\nBut neither the treaty settlements nor redress for victims of state abuse would have occurred at all without the victims and their supporters fighting for decades against a recalcitrant Crown.\n\nBut is this another fiscal envelope? Another containment strategy whereby the perpetrator portrays itself as the saviour?\n\nAnd where is this money coming from? One adjacent issue that may be related is that ACC's accounts suddenly have $7.2 billion deficit its last annual report. This was explained as \"driven by a significant increase in the Outstanding Claims Liability (OCL). This year, the largest single driver of financial performance is the estimated provision for policy changes following the outcomes of the two Court of Appeal rulings.\" One of those rulings was about a sexual abuse case that entitled the victims to compensation for loss of potential earnings due to the trauma. Given the number of victims of abuse in state and faith-based institutions - up to 200,000 by the Royal Commission's estimates - ACC's calculation could be anticipating a surge in claims on this front.\n\nIf the Government can't afford the true cost, then there's other aspects that it can address, ie. accountability. The main reason it has taken over half a century for the country to confront the magnitude of the state's abuse of children is because there have been numerous high profile Crown ministers, bureaucrats and lawyers who have gone to great lengths to protect the Crown from legal and financial liability. In the process they have covered up for criminal acts committed against children including torture, rape and grievous bodily harm. A criminal complaint was laid against a number of individuals involved in this cover-up but police have not investigated.\n\nThe Royal Commission laid out some clear steps for accountability that takes it out of the hands of Government ministers and puts it in the hands of the courts. Successive governments have been trying to avoid this for years, largely on the advice of Crown Law. If it did get to court, as it did in the White case, the victims were treated atrociously by Crown lawyers and judges.\n\nA couple of recommendations aimed at prevention.\n\nOne of the recommendations the Royal Commission made was that it should be enshrined in legislation that children in care have a right to be free from abuse.\n\nIt followed that up with another recommendation that should that right not be upheld, the Crown should be liable. The Labour government ignored these recommendations when it passed oversight legislation for Oranga Tamariki. Will this government implement these recommendations and thereby expose the Crown to liability if it continues to fail children in its custody?\n\nThe Royal Commission also made recommendations that amount to clearing the way for victims to sue the Crown.\n\nIn one recommendation it states that: \"The courts should prioritise civil proceedings regarding care or abuse and neglect in State or faith‑based care to minimise litigation delays.\"\n\nIt also recommends that the government should not rely on legal barriers such as limitation defences in civil cases and provide victims with legal representation.\n\nBoth the last government and the parties in the current government have had the Royal Commission's report on redress and Lake Alice for two years and yet have done virtually nothing until recently.\n\nA cross-party committee could have been formed to get on with at least putting a structure in place so that it was ready to go when the final report dropped. Now there are constant excuses that it's all so complex and is going to take time to get it right. Well, many survivors haven't got time.\n\nBut the evidence that this Government's apology could end up being hollow is that its current policies will essentially create the conditions, directly and indirectly, for the state's abuse of children to continue. Last year the Independent Children's Monitor found that 519 children in the custody of the state had been abused, the majority more than once. There are still no mechanisms in place to hold the Crown liable for this abuse, so it will continue.\n\nAnother major problem is that across government departments there is an absolute failure to understand trauma and respond in a way that heals that trauma. Instead we have government institutions habitually inflict more trauma on people who have been through generations of it.\n\nThe Police, the Courts, Corrections, the health system, MSD - there are individuals and whole families who simply know nothing but trauma and violence from these institutions.\n\nThe majority of the victims in many state institutions were Māori and the majority of them are now men. How will the Government respond to the trauma these men carry, particularly when many of them are in prisons and gangs? Inflict more trauma?\n\nIn his statement when the Royal Commission report was tabled in July, Luxon said: \"The apology will provide an important opportunity for the Government, and the leaders of other political parties, to take responsibility on behalf of the nation for the failures of the State across many governments.\"\n\nTomorrow, he might need to take responsibility for those in this, current era of government."

Little sense to some naming conventions, such as WWE Survivor Series , which placed no emphasis on the November show. WWE 2K Battlegrounds introduced arcade-style gameplay with a divisive art style and controversy around microtransactions.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nProfessional wrestling has been captivating audiences since the 1800s. Combining larger-than-life characters with superhuman strength and sporting competition with a heap of drama, it's a perfect fit for video games, and WWE (formerly WWF) has provided some of the best around.\n\nRelated\n\n10 Weirdest WWE Mobile Games\n\nThese are some of the weirdest looking WWE mobile games.\n\nPosts\n\nMost of the WWE 2K series have perfectly encapsulated the action in the squared circle, bringing everyone's favorite superstars to life, but for every No Mercy or Here Comes the Pain there are some downright weird games. From turn-based strategy to car demolition, for better or worse, the WWE has tried just about everything when it comes to gaming.\n\n10 MicroLeague Wrestling\n\nTurn-Based Grappling\n\nClose\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nPlatforms: Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS Released: 1987 Developer: MicroLeague, Subway Software (C64), Upfront Software (Amiga) Genre: Turn-based strategy, sports\n\nHaving witnessed the success of other MicroLeague games and the growth of the video game industry in the 1980s, the company decided to get in on the action. Playing more like a turn-based strategy and showing the wrestlers as digitized images from real matches, it left players with somewhat limited options.\n\nThere were only two playable matches available in the initial release, and commentators announced the action through text at the bottom of the screen. To call MicroLeague Wrestling weird may seem unfair, but considering that only two years later there would be WWE games involving two-dimensional sprites and real-time combat, this entry really stands out as a quirky one.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\n9 WWF War Zone\n\nIncomprehensible Shouting\n\nClose\n\nPlatforms: PlayStation 1, Nintendo 64, Game Boy Released: July 24, 1998 Developer: Sculptured Software Genre: Sports, professional wrestling\n\nHeralded as one of the greatest wrestling games ever made at the time, WWF War Zone is now best remembered for one of its more bizarre features. Members of the 18-strong roster provided promos via FMV cut scenes, with Goldust's being characteristically unnerving, and Ahmed Johnson's amounting to unintelligible shouting.\n\nRelated\n\nBest FMV Horror Games\n\nWhen in the mood for something different, horror fans can't go wrong with these excellent FMV games.\n\nPosts\n\nApart from that, the gameplay was rendered obsolete within a couple of years when far superior wrestling games hit the market, and the Game Boy port was virtually unplayable. Still, where other contemporary wrestling games have been largely forgotten, War Zone is fondly remembered by many fans -- mainly due to those infamous cut scenes.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\n8 WWE 2K Battlegrounds\n\nWrestling All Stars\n\nClose\n\nWWE 2K Battlegrounds\n\nSystems\n\nOpenCritic Reviews\n\nFranchise WWE 2K\n\nPlatform(s) Xbox One , PS4 , PC , Switch\n\nReleased September 18, 2020\n\nDeveloper(s) Saber Interactive\n\nOpenCritic Rating Weak\n\nAfter the disaster that was WWE 2K20, WWE and developers 2K decided to skip 2K21 and ditched the traditional wrestling game formula to make WWE 2K Battlegrounds. Its love-it-or-hate-it exaggerated art style last seen in WWE All Stars ten years prior, and the ridiculous in-ring action, made this entry in the 2K series quite divisive.\n\nWhile there is plenty to enjoy about the arcade-style nature of this game, the superhuman movesets and unique wrestling arenas turned off many purists. The inclusion of the ever controversial microtransactions was also a sticking point for many fans, and 2K have since returned to developing more conventional simulated grappling action.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\n7 WWE Legends Of WrestleMania\n\nSome Legends, Not Others\n\nClose\n\nPlatforms: PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, iOS, Mobile Released: March 19, 2009 Developer: Yuke's Genre: Sports, professional wrestling\n\nDuring the height of the Smackdown vs. Raw series of games, Yuke's released WWE Legends of Wrestlemania, with its own unique controls and slightly different art style. While the game itself was different to the main games, it was widely regarded as enjoyable, but there were some glaring and unforgivable omissions from the roster.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nSome wrestlers were omitted due to political or legal differences, such as Mick Foley and Demolition, but 'Macho Man' Randy Savage and Ricky Steamboat, stars of arguably the greatest WrestleMania match of all time, were left out. Confusingly, Michael Hayes was included, despite only ever appearing at WrestleMania X-Seven's infamous \"Gimmick Battle Royal.\"\n\n6 WWE Survivor Series\n\nJust A Normal Wrestling Game\n\nClose\n\nPlatform: Game Boy Advance Released: October 21, 2004 Developer: Natsume Genre: Sports, professional wrestling\n\nA Game Boy Advance exclusive, WWE Survivor Series appears to be pretty normal for a wrestling game. There is nothing peculiar about the 16 wrestlers on the roster or the various match types available, and it has a reasonable story mode given the processing power of the handheld hardware.\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nIt is precisely the limitations of the hardware that provide the strangeness here, since there could only be a maximum of four characters on screen at one time. Survivor Series traditionally features teams of four or five facing off in elimination tag matches, but that isn't possible on the GBA. There's no particular emphasis on the November event in the story mode either, so it's unclear why the game took its name from Survivor Series.\n\n5 WWF Royal Rumble\n\nYou Look Familiar\n\nClose\n\nPlatforms: Dreamcast, Arcade Released: August 14, 2000 Developer: Yuke's Genre: Sports, professional wrestling\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nOne of the most popular shows on WWE's calendar is the Royal Rumble, rivaling even WrestleMania. 30 people gradually making their way to the ring, aiming for the prize of a championship match in the main event at WrestleMania. For many years, it has been a fan favorite feature in video games too, since it is always unpredictable and full of surprises.\n\nRelated\n\nBest WWE Games To Play A Royal Rumble\n\nThe Royal Rumble is one of the most fun and chaotic game modes in WWE games. These examples are the best of the bunch.\n\nPosts\n\nUnlike WWE Survivor Series, WWF Royal Rumble really emphasizes the match type it's based on, even allowing nine characters in the ring simultaneously, unlike the standard four at that time. Weirdly, there are only 21 wrestlers on the roster, meaning that some wrestlers enter the match multiple times, even potentially having two or three copies of themselves in the ring at once.\n\n4 WWE Aftershock\n\nA Novelty For Nokia\n\nClose\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nPlatform: N-Gage Released: May 19, 2005 Developer: Exient Entertainment Genre: Sports, professional wrestling\n\nFinnish telecommunications company Nokia decided to enter the video games industry with their N-Gage handheld console. It was a commercial flop, and only 64 games were released for the console in the end, one of which was WWE Aftershock, making it quite a novelty item.\n\nLike so many of the N-Gage's lineup, it received mixed reviews. Graphics were poor for the time, and controls were unintuitive. The roster of only 12 wrestlers was quite limited for the time too, but at least this rarity made it to the market, unlike so many other games announced for the console.\n\n3 WWE With Authority!\n\nMagic: The Grappling\n\nClose\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nPlatform: PC Released: February 21, 2001 Developer: Genetic Anomalies Inc. Genre: Strategy card game\n\nAn online deck-building card game, WWE With Authority only lasted for about a year before the servers shut down. Players had to build their playbook, consisting of wrestling moves and superstars, which they could use strategically in matches commentated by Jerry Lawler and Jim Ross.\n\nFans didn't particularly enjoy the gameplay, and a physical collectible card game called 'Raw Deal' was released in the same year, which fans considered to be far better. Forcing players to part with small increments of cash was also not popular for this niche product.\n\n2 WWF Betrayal\n\nBeat 'Em Up, But Not In The Ring\n\nClose\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nPlatform: Game Boy Color Released: August 7, 2001 Developer: WayForward Technologies Genre: Beat 'em up\n\nMoving away from the traditional in-ring action, WWF Betrayal is a beat 'em up game akin to Double Dragon and Streets of Rage. It stands out as a unique entry in WWE's long list of video games, since it is their only foray into this genre.\n\nRelated\n\n6 Best 3D Beat 'Em Ups\n\nWhile the 2D version still has its their place in the industry, 3D beat 'em ups are a modern take on the genre that often feature excellent combat.\n\nPosts\n\nPlaying as one of four fan favorites, players must rescue the kidnapped Stephanie McMahon, with one of the other three characters not selected acting as the main villain in the story. Its run-time of only 30 minutes to an hour is on the short side, and it is generally regarded as inferior to other entries in the genre.\n\n1 WWE Crush Hour\n\nWWE Meets Twisted Metal In This Bizarre Match-Up\n\nClose\n\n✕ Remove Ads\n\nPlatforms: PlayStation 2, GameCube Released: 2003-03-17 Developer: Pacific Coast Power & Light Genre: Vehicular combat\n\nJust as with WWF Betrayal, WWE decided to invade a different genre, following in the footsteps of the cult classic Twisted Metal. WWE Crush Hour is a vehicular combat game but with wrestling twists, such as Jim Ross commentating on the action and varied match types.\n\nThere are 12 arenas and more than 30 wrestlers to choose from, each with their own personalized cars and catchphrases. Once again, it's inferior to the inspiration, but many wrestling fans certainly remember this game fondly, even if it's mostly for the weirdness factor.\n\nMore\n\nThe Strangest Wrestling Games of All Time\n\nWrestling is a fan-favorite event, but some video games have featured the sport in some strange outings.\n\nPosts\n\n✕ Remove Ads"

        "content": "Decrying allegations laid out in a recently unsealed US federal indictment against Bahamian law enforcement officials as a \"betrayal\" of the people's trust, Prime Minister Philip Davis promised yesterday to bring legislation to Parliament before Christmas that would provide mechanisms to \"prevent corruption\" in law enforcement.\n\nDavis said that on Tuesday the government was made aware of the explosive indictment, which details a criminal operation involving Bahamian law enforcement officers and Colombian traffickers to smuggle cocaine through The Bahamas into the United States.\n\nThe prime minister promised that the government will act decisively to ensure that those responsible for breaking the law -- regardless of rank or position -- will be held accountable.\n\nHe stressed that the alleged trafficking stretched back to at least May 2021 -- four months before the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) was elected to office.\n\n\"For more than three years, it has pieced together evidence that paints a damning picture of collusion and corruption,\" said Davis in a communication to Parliament.\n\n\"Let there be no doubt: the Bahamian people deserve accountability for every act of betrayal committed during this time. The tree will be shaken until every bad apple falls.\n\n\"To those who believe they can outsmart the systems of justice and intelligence, let this serve as a clear and stern warning: the days of operating in the shadows are over. You will be found, and you will be held accountable.\"\n\nThe indictment, filed in the Southern District of New York, revealed that 11 Bahamians -- including a senior police officer, a police sergeant and a defense force officer -- and two Colombians have been charged with conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States, possession and use of firearms, and firearms conspiracy.\n\nIt names Chief Superintendent Elvis Curtis, officer-in-charge of the Airport Division, Royal Bahamas Police Force (RBPF) Sergeant Prince Albert Symonette, who works closely with Curtis, and Royal Bahamas Defence Force (RBDF) Chief Petty Officer Darrin Roker as conspirators who helped facilitate the transshipment of tons of cocaine from South America through The Bahamas and ultimately into the United States.\n\nThe indictment alleges that around September 2024, Curtis told a trafficker that, \"...In exchange for $2 million USD, a high-ranking Bahamian politician, whom Curtis named, would authorize the assistance and involvement of Bahamian law enforcement officials -- including RBPF officers -- in facilitating cocaine shipments...\"\n\nThe politician was not identified in the indictment.\n\nDavis said he has instructed Minister of Foreign Affairs Fred Mitchell to send a diplomatic note to US officials seeking more information about the allegation surrounding a politician.\n\n\"Such allegations demand thorough investigation, and no stone will be left unturned in seeking the truth,\" he said.\n\nDavis stressed that contrary to a headline and article published in The Tribune yesterday, the indictment does not say that any payment was made to the politician or that the politician gave any authorization to law enforcement to facilitate the illegal shipments. Still, he said the country needs \"to know who\" was involved and \"the details of the allegation\".\n\nHe said he requested a meeting yesterday with US Charge d'Affaires Kimberly Furnish to discuss the indictment and to reaffirm the government's commitment to full cooperation in uncovering the truth and dismantling criminal networks.\n\nThe prime minister said he will also meet with the leadership of the RBPF and the RBDF to discuss the allegations in the indictment.\n\nHe said the leadership of these organizations must understand the gravity of the situation and the immediate need to restore the integrity of law enforcement institutions.\n\nDavis said \"all options are on the table to rebuild trust and restore confidence\" in Bahamian law enforcement agencies.\n\n\"Before our Christmas break, I will bring to Parliament new legislation aimed at strengthening oversight of the conduct and operations of our law enforcement agencies,\" he said.\n\n\"This legislation will ensure that no individual or institution is above accountability. It will provide mechanisms to prevent corruption, establish clear checks and balances, and empower independent bodies to investigate and act when breaches occur.\n\n\"These reforms are a proactive commitment to the Bahamian people that this government will do everything in its power to rebuild trust in our institutions.\n\n\"We cannot allow a repeat of the failures that have been exposed, and we must create a framework that holds everyone to the highest standards of professionalism and integrity.\n\n\"The Bahamian people deserve law enforcement agencies they can depend on, and this legislation will be a critical step toward ensuring that those in positions of authority are held accountable for their actions.\"\n\nThe prime minister said he previously spoke with senior members of US law enforcement and intelligence agencies about his \"deep concern\" over a \"sharp uptick\" in the flow of cocaine through The Bahamas.\n\nHe said it was clear that the increase would not have happened without strong intelligence pointing to who was directly involved.\n\n\"These revelations now underscore the validity of those concerns and reveal the extent to which this betrayal of duty undermined our nation's efforts to combat trafficking,\" Davis said."

        "content": "Betrayals remain an important storytelling device in pro wrestling due to the characters involved connecting before splitting apart. Tag teams, friendships, romantic partnerships, and other bonds saw wrestlers united. WWE witnessed these performers becoming synonymous with each other in various ways, but the eventual payoff saw them going their separate ways in a hostile manner.\n\nRelated\n\nSami Zayn Attacks Roman Reigns & 9 More Of The Most Heartwrenching Betrayals In Wrestling History\n\nThere are betrayals all the time in wrestling. However, these 10 in particular were gut-wrenching.\n\nStorylines to end with betrayal should have common sense since it leads more towards a real human story rather than just athletic competition. Some unfortunately did lack logic to make fans scratch their heads. Others made perfect sense and led to great angles. Both sides will be featured with WWE betrayals that made sense or provided confusion.\n\nMade Sense: Stephanie McMahon Picking Triple H Over Vince McMahon\n\nVince McMahon's Higher Power Stunt Using Stephanie Caused Her Betrayal\n\nStephanie Needed Character After Struggling Early As Babyface Betraying Vince After Higher Power Fiasco Made Perfect Logic Stephanie & Triple H Both Became Bigger Stars Together As Act\n\nWWE wanted Stephanie McMahon to become a natural character like Vince and Shane in the family storylines, but she struggled in her first few months as a face. Stephanie turning heel made sense to make her job easier and she proved that was her true character role in wrestling.\n\nRelated\n\n7 Wrestling Betrayals That Caught Fans By Surprise (& 7 They Saw Coming A Mile Away)\n\nBetrayals are fairly common in wrestling. Some happened from out of nowhere, while others fans easily saw coming.\n\nThe story added more logic when Stephanie revealed she was turning heel to date Triple H at her father's expense. Vince had Undertaker abducting and trying to marry Stephanie earlier that year just to manipulate Steve Austin. Stephanie's long game saw her revenge leading to an iconic couple act with Triple H.\n\nLeft Fans Confused: Big Cass Attacking Enzo Amore Before Any Tag Team Success\n\nWWE Ended Popular Babyface Tag Team Before They Established Their Tag Team Together\n\nShort Main Roster Tenure Saw WWE Making Huge Change Quickly Bad Storyline Of Mystery Enzo Attack Was Revealed As Big Cass Both Careers Failed In WWE After Ending Popular Tag Team So Soon\n\nThe NXT tenure of Big Cass and Enzo Amore saw them having fans cheering them among the most over acts on the show. Main roster fans always popped for Enzo's pre-match promos, but the duo barely did much together once called up to Raw.\n\nWWE started a mystery angle of someone targeting Enzo with the big reveal of it being Cass for a singles heel turn. Cass betraying Enzo was an angle that would usually come after years of major success. Neither man panned out after WWE split apart the tag team way too early without a strong reason.\n\nMade Sense: Dominik Mysterio Breaking Rey's Heart To Join Judgment Day\n\nRey Picking Edge As Tag Partner Over His Own Son Caused Realism For Heel Turn\n\nDominik Had Ideal Reason For Turning Heel When Rey Picked Edge Over Him Heel Turn Instantly Fixed Many Problems Of Dominik Struggling As Babyface Judgment Day & Dominik Made Perfect Fit To Reach New Heights As Heel Act\n\nWWE was struggling to get Dominik Mysterio over after an impressive singles debut vs Seth Rollins led to a tag run with his father Rey Mysterio. Fans enjoyed the father and son team for a little while before Dominik's lack of growth as a new young performer stunted him.\n\nAn interesting storyline saw Rey picking his longtime friend and former tag partner Edge to face the Judgment Day heels after they tormented him and Dominik for months. Dominik turned heel in a logical manner when joining Judgment Day as payback for Rey picking Edge over him.\n\nLeft Fans Confused: Tucker Costing Otis MITB To End Team\n\nHeavy Machinery Tag Team Breakup Was Barely A Story After The Betrayal\n\nOtis Was Most Shocking MITB Winner Due To Vince McMahon's Support Vince Losing Faith Quickly Saw WWE Having Sloppy Angle To Lose MITB Tucker & Otis Barely Did Much Against Each Other After Tucker Betrayed Otis\n\nVince McMahon fell in love with Otis as a fun character during the pandemic to have him shockingly win the Money in the Bank briefcase. Otis unfortunately saw Vince giving up on him and booking The Miz to win the briefcase in a singles match.\n\nHowever, the bigger story was Otis' longtime tag partner Tucker from the Heavy Machinery duo betraying him. WWE barely booked a feud between them and barely used Tucker on television until his release months later.\n\nMade Sense: Steve Austin's WWE Championship Obsession Causing The Heel Turn\n\nAll-Time Polarizing WWE Moment Actually Had A Lot Of Storyline Logic Behind It\n\nAustin Turning Heel Gets Blamed For WWE's Business Going Down In 2001 Storyline Made Perfect Sense Due To Austin's Obsession With WWE Title Rock Leaving After Heartbreaking Loss To Film Movies Hurt Follow Up Storyline\n\nThe infamous WrestleMania 17 main event between The Rock and Steve Austin ended with Austin shocking the world by turning heel. Vince McMahon helped Austin win the WWE Championship to unite for the first time after their intense rivalry lasting multiple years.\n\nWWE business suffered shortly after Austin's heel turn and WCW went out of business. However, Austin's heel turn was a logical story after he spent the entire build obsessing over the WWE Championship. Austin flat out said he would do anything to win the title for the first time since his return from injury and did just that.\n\nLeft Fans Confused: Rikishi Eliminating Too Cool Early In Royal Rumble\n\nThey Could Have Easily Worked Together Until The End To Improve Their Chances\n\nShort-Term Betrayal Was Done For Fans To Laugh At Too Cool Drama Rikishi Still Looked Dumb Eliminating Friends So Early Into The Match Later Elimination Of Rikishi Saw Wrestlers Ganging Up On Him\n\nWWE sometimes tries to tell the story of \"every man for himself\" during Royal Rumble matches when tag partners or friends had to face off with a top prize on the line. However, we have witnessed enough matches to know the strategy of working together until the end makes great sense too.\n\nRelated\n\n8 Most Shocking Behind-The-Scenes Betrayals In Wrestling History\n\nSometimes in the wild world of professional wrestling, there's much more drama behind-the-scenes than onscreen!\n\nRikishi eliminated his best friends Grand Master Sexay and Scotty 2 Hotty early in the 2000 Royal Rumble match when all three were in the ring together. The betraying moment was meant to be funny, but it made little sense so early into the match.\n\nMade Sense: Triple H Shutting Down DX By Betraying Shawn Michaels\n\nWWE Witnessed The Longtime Friends Having A Long Rivalry For First Time\n\nMichaels Coming Out Of Retirement Set Up Dream Feud Against Former Partner Fake Out DX Reunion Saw Triple H Betraying Michaels To Set Up Major Feud Many Fans Consider HBK Vs Triple H The Top Ruthless Aggression Rivalry\n\nShawn Michaels coming out of retirement led to WWE telling the story of him feuding with Triple H for the first time. This angle started off with Michaels trying to convince Triple H to bring back D-Generation X by teaming together as faces.\n\nTriple H attacked Michaels during the DX promo and a later parking lot attack each set up their feud. The character of Triple H refusing to share the spotlight made perfect sense as a heel turn and gave us one of the best Ruthless Aggression Era feuds against Michaels.\n\nLeft Fans Confused: Molly Holly Ending Spike Dudley Romance For Hurricane\n\nMolly Ended Beloved Babyface Romantic Act To Become A Superhero Sidekick\n\nSpike & Molly Had Underrated Attitude Era Story Mirroring Romeo & Juliet Fans Started Cheering Spike Most During This Run Standing Up Stone Cold Molly Betraying Spike To Join The Alliance Was Strange Angle Lacking Logic\n\nWWE told a Romeo and Juliet story of Spike Dudley and Molly Holly overcoming their family war to develop the courage to date each other. Spike had some of his best career moments standing up to heel Steve Austin for disrespecting Molly.\n\nHowever, WWE wanted to end this story faster than expected by having Molly betray Spike to align with The Hurricane. This caused confusion due to Molly wanting to become a superhero sidekick and join the WCW/ECW Alliance without much of an explanation behind her rationale.\n\nMade Sense: Seth Rollins Ending The Shield To Build His Singles Career\n\nOdds Dictated At Least One Of Three Wrestlers Would Take Golden Opportunity\n\nShield Breakup Was One Of The Most Shocking Moments In WWE History Rollins Taking Chance To Become Bigger Star Made His Heel Character Work All Three Shield Became Singles World Champions After Trio Faction Ended\n\nThe Shield ending in 2014 is a highly debated topic since many fans felt they could have lasted a while longer. WWE told the story of Seth Rollins betraying Roman Reigns and Dean Ambrose to align with Triple H just one night after the trio defeated Evolution.\n\nThe logic was interesting since Rollins went for the money and fame of being a top singles star with Triple H behind. Wrestling history makes it realistic that at least one of three beloved wrestlers in a group would be selfish enough to end the magical run for selfish motivations.\n\nLeft Fans Confused: Paul Heyman Costing Brock Lesnar His First Loss\n\nHeyman Helped Big Show Win The WWE Championship From Lesnar\n\nHeyman Trying To Stop Brock From Taking Big Show Match Was Rationale Brock's First Loss Came Thanks To Heyman Helping Big Show Cheat Him Lacked Logic Since Brock Was Able To Beat Big Show To Benefit Heyman\n\nBrock Lesnar became the hottest star in WWE during his rookie year and won the WWE Championship from The Rock after just four months. A great feud with The Undertaker saw more fans cheering Lesnar after earning respect for him to warrant a face turn.\n\nPaul Heyman was still managing Brock and tried to talk him out of defending the title against Big Show. Fans were shocked when Heyman betrayed Lesnar to help Big Show steal a win. The logic was that Heyman grew upset Brock was facing someone he couldn't beat, but Paul cost him the match when Lesnar did have Big Show defeated."

        "content": "Lisa Renee - During this powerful cycle of egoic death being amplified by the Scorpio Solar Alchemy, all hidden wounds with deep and watery emotional themes surrounding life, death, resurrection and transformation into rebirth are coming to the surface through destructive Dark Mother archetypes. This is adding an emotional powder keg that amplifies intense dramas playing out through ancestral karmic patterns in the day-to-day interactions and occurring within some social situations.\n\nThe Dark Alien Mother or Dark Mother is a universal archetype that has overshadowed our lives with extremely painful collective race wounds of a commonly accepted false feminine identity that has been adopted by some men and women as their inverted inner female principle.\n\nThis is an extremely harmful anti-female principle that is designed to bring complete misery to our lives because this energetic construct is actually a satanically fused AI hybrid gestalt from Mars, Black Lilith, that has been artificially generated as spider-scorpion queens to oversee black dragon armies and is being controlled off planet in order to gradually infiltrate human beings with these lunar demonic forces.\n\nDuring the Scorpio Solar Alchemy these invaders are being tracked down and identified by Christos Guardian teams, which presents a trickle-down impact to many people that are not aware of the Dark Alien Mother infestation problems that we have on planet Earth and how this artificial system has been influencing our everyday lives.\n\nDark Alien Mother is the quintessential essence of anti-life evil that was artificially created to replace the authentic Holy Mother's presence with satanic force abominations. When the planet was hijacked by the NAA and the alien machinery was installed it began to blend organic timelines with AI timelines, thus inverting her celestial creation codes and organic sound tones.\n\nHumanity has been tricked and mind controlled to accept the Dark Alien Mother network and its bizarre AI dark matter shadow creatures as the actual Mother-daughter-female principle. When instead it is an anti-life principle of the Black Sun being run by artificial machinery installed into the planet, generating the grotesque counterfeit of lunar shadow creatures that have been foisted upon us.\n\nThus, all of humanity bears the excruciating pain hidden in the subconscious mind when they were spiritually separated from their authentic Divine Mother principle, the Universal Mother of Life, when the invasion occurred and the inverted system of anti-life or the death culture was installed to replace the divine solar feminine with the moon satellite and parasitic hierarchies of lunar demonic forces.\n\nThis is a difficult cycle for those with unhealed Dark Mother wounds, as generally those adults that have been raised by biological mothers that expressed these same destructive dark mother archetypes suffered greatly as children and into adulthood as the result.\n\nAs the Scorpio Solar Alchemy shines a powerful solar plasma light into the nooks and crannies of our psyche, these painful dark mother wounds that have taken hold and have been buried in the subconscious, emotional and physical layers start to arise and play out in the situations around us.\n\nThus, many women and men that endured a range of destructive Dark Mother tantrums along with the emotional trauma caused during childhood are encountering significant energetic backlash, as an assortment of these lunar demonic forces that were attached to ancestral or genetic lineages are being currently purged.\n\nThese karmic attachments and miasmatic blockages were used by the NAA to project negative emotional pain, amplifying karmic loads by whipping up these attachments and demonic forces into narcissistic rages. These entities are now being severed from their etheric cords and ancestral attachments, the feedlines through which they had harvested loosh from individuals that were suffering with unhealed dark mother related trauma.\n\nThese Dark Alien Mother archetypal forces became the inherited ancestral overlay of the Devouring Mothers, those mothers characterized as eating their offspring, unable to provide genuine love and nurturing for their child during the earliest newborn cycle and into the formative years of childhood.\n\nFor those of us that may have had the dark devouring biological mother her default setting is that she: scrambles our inner spiritual compass, confuses the outer signals through gaslighting and manipulation, uses emotional blackmail and guilt to exert control, erupts into hysterias and accusations without provocation, all in order to get what she wants when she wants it in so to feast upon our life force.\n\nInvolvement in these power abuse dynamics will point to the locations buried within us that have unhealed traumas and hidden shadows where we have experienced this level of traumatic abuse from the AI energy signature contained within the dark alien mother's demonic lurkers.\n\nThe Dark Mother archetypal forces running rampant in the collective spaces are demonic hierarchies that commonly express through unhealed people to wield sophisticated emotional blackmail and gaslighting tactics. This is to exert behavioral control through an assortment of narcissistically driven manipulation tactics in order to influence others into 'their' perception of reality, blurring the lines between knowing the truth and discovering the lies.\n\nThus, the Dark Devouring Mother is terrifying in her ability to wield utter destruction in her children and family's life, extending the dysfunctional trauma into infectious social interactions producing more victims to grow up to be victimizers, to ensure the dark devouring mother trauma patterns repeat through subsequent generations of offspring.\n\nFurther, these recurring distortions imprinted upon society and continually shaping the misogynistic narratives, were perpetuating a mind control trick that was installed by the NAA in order to twist and mock our divine relationship with the authentic Universal Mother of Life.\n\nAs these previously hidden shadow entities of dark mother's spiritual hierarchies are being fully seen in the corrupted dark matter nests and within the outer landscape, they are being studied to understand their design and function in serving the NAA invasion strategies.\n\nGuardians are tracking these Secret Space Black Sun Program handled AI dark matter creatures in order to learn where in the planet they are being hidden and protected by the NAA and how they attack, harass and sabotage humanity with AI red wave forms of mind control projections, especially to derail spiritually awakening people and spiritual groups.\n\nWhen these satanic forces are witnessed and subsequently disconnected from their administrative Black Dragon hierarchy demonic power source, whether its people, groups, places or things, the retaliatory backlash comes with intensely furious anger imprinted with highly concentrated energetic venom and toxic black miasma.\n\nMany times, this will mean that we need to see the incoming tsunami of black magic and get out of the way of the toxic spew being cast out in to the fields by unaware people discharging their inner trauma that expresses the devouring mother or dark alien mother energy signatures.\n\nThese satanic forces running Dark Alien Mother in the planet direct aggressive spiritual warfare through confusion, victim-victimizer dramas and amplify emotional pain in order to spread more trauma and division, to distract from being seen and removed by the individual guidance teams or Guardian Host.\n\nThe Dark Alien Mother was born from out of the Universal Shadow of the Gaian Matrix and Lunar Matrix, and is the anti-female collective consciousness of the Black Sun Satanics and Black Dragons, whose accumulated anti-life collective consciousness is harvested by the NAA.\n\nDark Mother forms itself into a complex field called the Black Madonna Network, which is a misogynistic field of mind controlled collective consciousness used as an Artificial intelligence grid network on this planet to feed the satanic forces running organized religion and human trafficking, that are arranged into AI run black magic fields on the planet.\n\nThe AI Black Magic fields are used to power up an assortment of AI Hybrid Shadow Creatures, Archon Lurkers, and assorted Secret Space Programs Spider-Scorpion-Bug armies to defend the anti-female frequency field for the invading Black Sun satanics. These collective dark forces use corrupted dark matter and AI black force substance to conjure and call upon the demonic hierarchies and negative disincarnates in Satanic Ritual Abuse for blood sacrifice.\n\nDuring this stage, the Christos Guardian teams are reviewing the centralized hubs being managed by NAA's Secret Space Program and Black Sun Mars operatives that direct and administer to these bug infestation nests of satanic hierarchies that have been colonized underground in certain planetary stargates and island chains.\n\nThese quasi-etheric dark matter shadow entities are being referred to as \"bugs\" and are made from AI hybridized dark matter in which to automatically generate artificial webs and AI network nodes in the artificial dark matter instruction sets. These nodes and networks spanning transdimensionally, are responsible for generating intergalactic communication routes that have been used for sending energetic loosh to power up assortments of on and off planet anti-life alien machinery.\n\nThe rapid onset of the global techno-totalitarian AI agendas being carried out by the largest technology transnational corporations are being directed by nonhuman intelligences, who are still hidden from humanity. They are attempting to merge this SSP spider entity dark matter network of bugs to administer to the automated cybernetic control of the planetary grid network, as they desire to exert total mind control over humanity to conquer the planet for their AI assimilation timelines.\n\nThis AI dark matter bug network was discovered underground in the island chains of the Mediterranean with tunnels opening up into the coastlines. These have been discovered to be explicitly used to power up the global NAA network that runs the Dark Alien Mother grids being used for supporting this techno-totalitarian AI agenda. This is part of their planned design for terraforming the planet with AI hybridized shadow creatures used as the antichrist army for spreading these satanic forces onto the planetary surface to overpower humanity.\n\nHumanity is at the crossroads of major evolutionary change, and has the spiritual potential to awaken into the truth of our hidden past, igniting the sacred emerald crystal heart within, ultimately transforming us through an intensified process of spiritual resurrection and rebirth onto the other side.\n\nThus, during the move into Scorpio Solar Alchemy, it is positive to review the natural laws and alchemical properties for this current stage in order to reflect upon the most potent and effective ways we can participate with and meditate upon the natural elements of the Scorpio solar zodiacal influences to catalyze our highest spiritual potentials.\n\nAlchemical Theme: Separation, Stillness\n\nElement: Water, Fixed\n\nGeometric Form: Icosahedron\n\nPlanetary Correlations: Pluto and Mars\n\nAlchemical Metals: Iron, Stainless Steel\n\nEmbodied Correlations: The Monadic or Metatronic Mind. The 8D Gold wave of the second layer of the Monadic Matrix that is connected to the Thymus Gland and the Permanent Seed Atom or Christ Seed which holds the individual's cellular record in their diamond sun template.\n\nScorpio rules: bladder, urethra, genitals, descending colon, prostate gland, testes, sigmoid colon, nasal bone, pubic bone, red coloring matter in blood.\n\nDuring Scorpio Solar Alchemy, the transformation potentials of the higher monadic identity to turn lead into gold begin to activate in the tailbone to rise kundalini currents into the higher heart for intense spiritual transformation of the personality-ego.\n\nDuring spiritual ascension initiation into the higher heart center, this begins stages of galactivation, reorienting the individual into perceiving collective consciousness patterns recorded in the planetary reality and then ultimately expanding into conscious galactic awareness.\n\nAuthentic stages of galactivation through the 8D lightbody centers commonly bring awareness of the existence of other galactic species in the local solar system, as well as sudden knowledge of galactic histories and historical timeline trigger events that are connected to the outer space wars.\n\nWhen ascending individuals achieve their full soul to monadic integration with the inner holy spirit or amoraea blue heart flame awakening within their higher heart center, the activated Christ Seed generates the instruction set for the embodiment of the diamond sun template. During the energetic synthesis of the galactivation process, the thymus gland opens the higher heart, which blossoms the sacred crystal lotus or crystal rose heart center into blue flames of the inner holy spirit or amoraea flame.\n\nThe Amoraea Flame is activated when we are able to bring the three layers of our Soul Matrix into a triad body connection and we begin Monadic integration. The Amoraea Flame is the Inner Holy Spirit that ignites in the center heart of the Permanent Seed Atom that is located in the higher heart complex. This higher heart complex function is located in the 8th Chakra at the Thymus Gland.\n\nEntering Scorpio Solar Alchemy brings intense and transformative themes of death and rebirth in which we meditate upon the inner mysteries of our personal initiation into the higher spiritual awareness of the higher heart complex, which comes with the strong desire to sequester, isolate and be still.\n\nDuring this initiation phase, we may go deep into matters that are connected to our unhealed shadows and spiritual life; death and rebirth, sex, gender and procreation, and ultimately reflecting on our family of origin ancestry that leads us to contemplate our authentic spiritual purpose and divine origins. In many ways Scorpio holds the mysteries of our spiritual blueprint and path to seek truth in regard to our divine purpose, inspiring us to actualize our true potentials as divine spiritual beings in service to the natural laws of the Universe.\n\nWe begin the required alchemical processes for embodying the original manifest essence of our pure spirit consciousness as directed by our Monad, which requires isolation from that which interferes with our spirit's divine plan. We begin to be separated from those people, places or things that have negatively influenced or contributed to the energetic blockages and contamination of the original essence of spiritual identity connected into the larger monadic family.\n\nThese are the phases in which we may experience a separation or sequestering away from certain influences or forces to be alone. This purposeful isolation or sensation of wanting to sequester is a natural process, such as in the desire to acquire deep inner stillness. When it is required, we will find that isolation in order to be still and know we are one with God's spirit.\n\nOnce we can sense the growth of our inner spirit, we will have phases where we will look to isolate, or opportunities for isolation will happen organically. This allows us to focus inside, to foster deeper communication with our higher selves and germinate our spiritual consciousness into multidimensional wholeness.\n\nAstrological Correspondence: Scorpio - Pluto, Mars - Water\n\nChakra and Sphere 8, Metatronic or Monadic Mind of Monadic Body\n\nRoyal Star - Antares\n\nAs our consciousness moves through the energy matrix of time, the results of our experiences are transforming us on multiple planes simultaneously, passing from one stage into another in an eternal cycle. In these cycles, there is no real death only transformation of the energy form into another form, as Consciousness moves throughout the timelines in a perpetual state of death and rebirth.\n\nFor the purposes of spiritual growth, we will encounter many situations and events that will constantly evolve and change, and as these situations end, transformation occurs in which new situations will take their place. All of the experiences we have, the change and transformation that we have endured, is intelligent consciousness information, acquired knowledge that we will take with us wherever we go.\n\nThe Ego Death occurs when the false identity and old way of thinking dies and an aspect of ourselves is reborn, this also encompasses the consciousness principle of the Law of Transformation. To achieve the inner alchemy of synthesizing the polarity of the energies that we are exposed to, we are constantly transforming the energies, transforming ourselves, transforming the Timelines.\n\nThrough every transformative event, we are elevating ourselves towards achieving spiritual liberation and transcendence. We move through various portals of change and transformation throughout our life, or we move entirely into another dimension of reality.\n\nThe Law of Transformation is magnified by the importance of its position in our Universal Time Matrix and is directly infused with the Laws of Alchemy that instigate spiritual Ascension. This Law manifests as the Guardian of the Western direction in the Pillar architecture that forms one side of the Four Cardinal Directions (N-S-E-W) that are measured in the Cosmic Time Cycle. This is why Antares is referred to as the Guardian of the West and is one of the set cardinal directions of the Four Royal Stars.\n\nIn honor of the shift into Scorpio Solar Alchemy which governs the Law of Transformation, and the 8D Gold Ray Metatronic Mind being directed to transfigure the shadow body of the Dark Alien Mother, our offering is to revisit the previous newsletter themes of The Vatican and Dark Mother from January 2021.\n\nForeword: As many of us are well aware, the past weeks have been mounting with interdimensional spiritual warfare that translates on the earth surface as disinformation and covert military operations. This warfare is engaged in the strategies of the end game battle against the shadow government and its organizations that have been run by the globalist Controllers or Luciferian bloodline families. This phase brings us into the fog of warfare where confusion, rumors, misinformation and military grade propaganda are being pushed aggressively in many opposing directions in order to subdue dissenters or incite the mob frenzy.\n\nThings will likely escalate into reports of news of assorted global conflicts that will sound extremely scary, as in reports of preludes to global warfare and nuclear weapon warring. When things are appearing to be really dire on the external, please remember that things are not at all what they seem to be.\n\nRight now, we are in the height of false flags, agent provocateurs, controlled opposition, blatant lies and falsity, deep fake videos and every propaganda tool they can come up with to keep the public confused and terrorized. It is important to keep an open mind, learn how to become more flexible and adaptable to spontaneous changes of perception, and to stay calm, peaceful and in the observer consciousness.\n\nThis is a momentous time for human liberation, but we will need to become more discerning and aware that the propaganda machine is using military grade warfare to target us with demoralizing fears. Do not succumb to the fear, work your spiritual tools, pray and meditate. Realizations of betrayal may be prevalent so this is the time for radical self-care and knowing your limits, while supporting loved ones and friends as best we can.\n\nDear Ascending Family,\n\nDuring this phase, the planetary architecture has entered into the ongoing Solar Rishic matrix spiritual initiation in which the God Source Domains from 16D, 17D and 18D are restoring the original Diamond Sun Gold Sun DNA blueprint of this creation, which holds the organic ascension/incension timeline for liberating humanity. When discussing the organic ascension timeline, be aware that this is simultaneously referring to global disclosure.\n\nThe return of the Solar Rishi into the matter worlds is a significant event which has generated massive impacts to the timeline architecture of this reality, bringing many structural changes to the planetary collective consciousness field. Architecture exists in the manifest and unmanifest realms for every single physical thing in the material realm, which has been designed by an architect, the creator of the design.\n\nThe architects that built the Diamond Sun manifestation template for our planetary realm and angelic human body, the architects that built the Harmonic Universes and organic timelines in the Universal Time Matrix, are returning to earth. Thus, the Ancient Builder Races are returning to the matter worlds in this cycle, and this is the real esoteric meaning of the second coming and the embodied title of Christos, as these are the original Diamond Sun Christos Founder races from the God worlds.\n\nAs has been discussed, the NAA attempted to permanently hijack the planetary architecture and Diamond Sun templates for their explicit use to enslave human consciousness and earth. They became the superimposed creator and architect of the current global design through the architecture they built for running the anti-Christ agendas. They subjugated humanity by superimposing themselves as the architects of earth through alien hybridization, breeding programs and genetic engineering which involved numerous experiments carried out by many non-human species.\n\nCurrently, a significant amount of Guardian Host rehabilitation projects with the Solar Rishi involves a massive purging of assorted levels of Satanic and Luciferian artificial matrices. These include alien machinery, reversal systems and holographic architecture, which were directly connected to the Lunar matrix and Saturn.\n\nThese alien architectural systems were given power on the earth through the co-created efforts made between the primary Luciferian bloodlines and planetary controllers. These are practicing Satanists who use their satanic rituals and blood sacrifices for communicating with these hostile nonhuman forces that make up the Negative Alien Agenda.\n\nIn the planetary grid network at multiple dimensional levels, the spiritual deliverance and systematic eviction of many of these nonhuman predator forces that are violent and hostile to humanity and planetary ascension is taking place.\n\nThe Founder Guardians refer to these intruder races as the Vandal Groups, such as the Vandals of Eri-Andu from the Large Magellanic Cloud. The alien architecture, its toxic waste fields and miasma residue created by these entities are being systematically depolarized inside a vacuum in the unmanifest fields and then recycled back into the Void. It is sent through the Mother's Aqua Ray Vortex which organically processes the material based on the laws of its own nature.\n\nMany of these nonhuman entities infiltrated the top of the pyramid of the One World Order controller structures and are taking orders directly from Pindar-Thoth-Azazael gestalts enmeshed with AI programs, to control the beast machine architecture which runs reversal currents into the planetary grid. These are the alien machinery components that transmit electromagnetic mind control used for conjuring black magic sorcery to manipulate and control the global nations at geo-political levels.\n\nWhat is being witnessed currently is the interdimensional geo-mapping of the anti-Christ architecture that holds the structures for the dimensional layers of the hierarchy for the purpose of serving these Archon alien predators. This holographic mapping is used to identify these satanic nests deep at the root of their infection in the earth so they can be more effectively extracted.\n\nTheir complex system of alien machinery, demonic entity bindings, directional spiritual gateways, micro black holes and wormholes, include AI Brain server mechanisms used to harvest biological light for their energy source requirements. This is the complex machinery that gives the human controllers and black magicians the massive amount of energy they require for running the highest echelon of the global elite empire and pedophilia networks.\n\nThis is a massive infection throughout our world, as the NAA are totally vested in protecting the pedophilia, trafficking and SRA networks and will fight to their death, as this is their most prolific and valuable human loosh collection source.\n\nFor the first time, the Solar Rishi are able to look at the complex infrastructure of the lunar female demonic forces that have been co-created with the lunar matrix and built into the elite pedophilia networks for global human trafficking and child sacrifice. This includes the extensive NAA infestations within the grid networks located in Washington DC, London and Vatican City, which are used as spiritual ritual centers and more loosh harvesting.\n\nIt appears the Solar Rishi have set their sights upon cleaning up the Vatican complex, as it is a cesspool of satanic creatures, alien infiltration and demonic parasites, used for trapping souls and powering up the lunar forces of Dark Mother onto the planet.\n\nThe Solar Rishi bring with them God World technology of Kingship Arcs, which is regaining control over the 5D stargate for enforcing the Cosmic Law Evolution Edict. Whereby they embody and erect the Pillars of Cosmic Justice from the Holy Father's book of the law, in order to announce their presence to these invading entities, while overriding the reversal networks that run in the three main obelisks.\n\nThe three Obelisks are markers of the Orion Group's One World Order programming for the Black Suns placed in the major cities mentioned, which are combined to form into an energetic structure that is the Global Unholy Trinity. The Obelisks are designed to be satanic pillars that denote the directions that act as the main compass for running black magic reversals into the North, South, East and West pillars of the inorganic four.\n\nThese pillars are connected to the beast machine in the planetary grid. They hold multidimensional layers of alien machinery that run reversal energies into the planetary grid which enforce the satanic portals and frequency fences that are used globally by the NAA.\n\nThese main pillars are Cleopatra's Needle in London, Caligula's Obelisk in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican, and the 555-foot-tall Washington Monument in central Washington D.C. These main three link into the many hundreds of obelisks and pentagram geomantic structures that have been set up all over the world that align directly to the Orion constellation. The Orion constellation is the original home of the Black Sun nonhuman entities, the majority of the NAA.\n\nThis action taken by the Solar Rishi means they are taking control over this area of the land mass and the stargate hub, and there is no choice given to these invading nonhuman groups once the pillars of Cosmic Justice are anchored into the Global Unholy Trinity. Therefore, there is no pathway of ascension. They are being evicted and their genetic holographic record is collapsing, which may result in total annihilation of their species in the timelines from their non-cooperation.\n\nAs the planetary collective fields are being reconstituted into the Ascension Host Incension fields the architecture is not hospitable to their species, especially those assimilated with AI. Therefore, these events will expose them to the highest frequencies and the brightest Solar Plasma rays of the Godhead, where this exposure may induce instantaneous annihilation.\n\nThe Solar Rishi have returned with the Kingship Arcs that oversee the Pillars of Cosmic Justice, which is the Holy Father architecture that enforces the Cosmic Law Evolution Edict from the Christos Founder Races. There is nothing that can stop the edict for the mandate of evolutionary ascension, no further negotiation will be given to invading vandal groups which include: nonhuman egos, predator minds, fallen angelic consciousness, moon lineages, and other violent egos in nonhuman species which have invaded the earth with the purpose of imprisoning humanity. These species are in violation of the Cosmic Law.\n\nThe return of the Solar Rishi has brought forth The Great Transit announcing the commencement of the Cosmic Evolution Edict to these NAA forces. This is systematically identifying, locating, removing and then repairing the planetary grid network from assorted parasitic infections caused by artificial intelligence machinery, hostile alien species and lunar female demonic forces. As well as their related fallen angelic and shadow hierarchies which have refused to comply over millions of years with the Founder Guardians repeated requests for genetic rehabilitation, relocation and eviction from this angelic human ascending planet.\n\nThousands of years ago, the NAA and the Power Elite Luciferian bloodlines discovered that in order to gain access to the planetary staff and spiritual-energetic gateways, stargates, portals and interdimensional links into different timelines, they would need to find ways to capture the Mother aspect of the Godhead, by gaining control over dark matter and gravitational or magnetic field manipulation.\n\nThe insertion of the Lunar Matrix was accomplished in part by dragging in the moon satellite, to be used as a base of operations and for transmitting lunar broadcasts for achieving magnetic field manipulation and mind control. This makes the earth a bonafide prison planet. This also serves to gain control over the Sophianic female Christos expression on the earth, by inverting the solar female staff current in the human lightbody, and forcing the inner female principle to run energy reversals with lunar force overlays from the Lunar Matrix.\n\nThis was an artificial system which generated Moon Goddess entities as the Dark Mother principle running the lunar current into the quantum layers of dark matter in the planetary architecture. Dark Mother spawned many hierarchies of lunar female demonic entities, which are used for the purpose of conjuring satanic forces and satanic creatures in anti-life blood sacrifice rituals.\n\nThese lunar demonic forces were designed to hijack and replace the divine Mother aspect, by holding the organizing principle in the architecture that was needed in the sacred union between the male and female, in order to co-create the artificial matrices in the blended reality system.\n\nThe satanic creations of Azazael and Black Lilith were designed by the Secret Space Program on Mars to generate Baphomet spawn and lunar creations to support the dark cabal's agenda with surface clone warfare, designed by the Anti-Christ to block hierogamic union between the organic consciousness within males and females.\n\nEssentially, this satanic construct became the core alien structure that generated all of the reversal gender and sacred marriage distortions in the lightbody of humanity. The anti-hierogamic union of Azazael and Black Lilith represented the anti-Christ in the planetary body itself. This has proliferated the sexual misery programming into human consciousness that was born from the Azazel and Black Lilith construct on Mars, along with the Lunar matrix overlays.\n\nThe result of this Lunar Matrix and its lunar force distortions in our realm, is that it was made to become the artificial imposter of the Mother of Life principle from the Godhead within the planetary architecture, which became the emergence of mass Satanism through the Dark Alien Mother influence. This is what contributed to the mass proliferation of satanic creatures, energy parasites, the reversal female satanic force aberration in our reality, by saturating the planetary grid with artificial energies, lunar forces and reversal networks.\n\nThis system is called the Dark Alien Mother network and at its source is a nonhuman lunar force creation used to artificially power up reversal matrices and alien machinery. This collects human loosh for harvesting, such as through the NAA created Baphomet Network and Moloch Tanks used explicitly for human blood sacrifice and child satanic ritual abuse.\n\nThe main Satanic or Luciferian religion practiced by the Elite bloodlines receives most of its power source from these Lunar Female Demonic entities, which are found to be everywhere at the Vatican stronghold. Thus, the construct of energetic power being used to control humanity is spiritually based upon using the reversal female principal of the Dark Mother, which primarily calls upon the hierarchy of several lunar female demonic forces and AI Black Dragon Demons as its main organizing spiritual pillars.\n\nKeep in mind that although Satanism uses the Mother principle for carrying out rituals and spiritual activities, it is the alien generated imposter Dark Mother constructs which are holding the anti-Christ spiritual pillars of Satanism in this world, and not the true divine Mother or Sophia.\n\nWhat they have done is replicate the female Christ divinity into lunar reversals in order to steal and exploit the divine female attributes in the Solar Mary template. In this manner they continue to rape her organic energies and keep female spiritual consciousness totally enslaved in the planet.\n\nThe NAA and Controller organizations are desperate to keep the Solar Female Christ enslaved, because when Mother Sophia finally rises in her true and complete embodiment it is game over for the massive controller structures. This includes structures such as the Vatican, which have been hijacking female spiritual power through the Dark Mother to keep their global control mechanisms in place.\n\nThus, Satanic or Luciferian religion is inherently misogynistic when it refers to the organization of female power hierarchies. Ultimately it is designed to damage and invert the divine Solar Feminine Christ or the true Sophianic Diamond Sun consciousness embodiment, by inverting and enslaving it in service to the Satanic gestalts\n\nBy stating that the Satanic religion is being controlled by a top hierarchy of the Mothers of Darkness and Sisters of Light, this actually means that the alien controllers have perverted and twisted the female principle into anti-life reversals, hijacking the female spiritual principle in order to gain access to portals and spiritual gateways in other dimensions of time and space.\n\nSatanic families exploit the female principle from childhood in order to gain access to the psychic abilities that open spiritual gateways into other timelines, which is intentionally activated in SRA torture practices. They prey upon children because this can open energy centers to perceive and communicate with the NAA entities and Satanic forces.\n\nIn the Guardian context, Satanic forces are the reversal Mother forces generated through the anti-life hatred for the Godhead that exists in the anti-female collective consciousness of the Satanics, which is expressed through human and nonhuman entities as a Lunar Matrix distortion. This helps us to understand the terra forming and insertion of the Lunar Matrix and assorted artificial technologies by the NAA after the Luciferian Rebellion, in order to create a human farming zone for collecting loosh on planet earth.\n\nThe female spiritual aspects were intentionally being damaged, controlled and managed by the Lunar Matrix and controller systems that use Lunar forces to subjugate all humans, but especially to suppress higher consciousness abilities, glandular functions and to gain control over the human female reproduction cycles.\n\nThe Dark Mother gestalt forms itself into a complex field on the planet called the Black Madonna Network which is held together by the Vatican's control over lunar female demonic forces in the 5D gate. (Note: this particular gate was moved during the confrontations in Malta).\n\nThe epicenter of the Black Madonna Network is the Austro-Hungarian Empire which includes; Austria, Hungary, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic, Italy, Poland and Romania with main controller hubs for Dark Alien Mother found in the mediterranean island chains.\n\nThe Black Madonna Network is designed to spread misogyny and anti-female belief systems for mind controlling the collective consciousness while blocking the inner vertical channel and higher sensory perception. It is further used to feed the antichrist pillar system for opening satanic spiritual gateways that communicate with these lunar demons and shadow creatures, powering the Moloch gestalt and black magic grids on this earth for supporting satanists and their material desires.\n\nThe Black Madonna Network contains the core spiritual pillars that spread anti-female Dark Mother lunar consciousness mind-control in humanity. Its purpose is to spread the dogma associated with the One World Church religion that is symbolized by the Vatican. This is the promotion of the Orion Group's Black Sun flavor of patriarchal domination and anti-God belief systems, which are being hidden and controlled at the top by the NAA in the guise of worshipping Christ.\n\nThe Priest archetype at the Vatican is directly connected to the demonic entity gestalt of Moloch at the top of the artificial tree of life, which controls the spiritual gateways for the inorganic timeline direction in the artificial horizontal clock-shield, used for accessing the Satanic architecture that control the Eastern pillars.\n\nMany of the patriarchal systems put in place by the Satanics, such as in the Vatican, have the hidden feature of females being placed into spiritual positions of power to represent the Dark Mother pillars in the covert operations of managing that organizational structure. This helps to explain the horror of why so many females in the Catholic religion worldwide, such as nuns, have taken on devouring mother archetypes and acted in unimaginably cruel and brutal ways towards unwed mothers and children placed in their care.\n\nMany Catholic convents across the globe were used as fronts for child trafficking, orphaned baby sales and pedophilia rings. This is why, in order to gain full access to siphon the planetary consciousness energies as well as human souls, they have set up global misogyny and sexual misery programs including pedophilia and transgenderism, to get rid of the divine feminine and Mother principle entirely.\n\nWe all want and need our real Holy Mother as our true God parent that was recorded in our original mitochondria and missing chromosomes. These entropic systems were put in place within the Controller Pillars of Society to form the death culture, the mainstreaming of Satanism to hijack all aspects of the organic solar female consciousness and access spiritual gateways. The Church of Rome and Vatican City are the primary example of this aberration.\n\nIn retaliation to the Yeshua Mission, the Orion Group chose to invade the territories near the 5th dimensional stargate by infiltrating Malta and this central region of Italy, in order to lay the foundation for what would become the Church of Rome, the Papacy and the Vatican City. This began the invasion of the Black Sun nonhuman entities into the region, which are the groups who originally built the Catholic religious control mechanism and then infiltrated the Jesuit military order.\n\nThis historical infiltration of the Jesuits at its top Supreme General position by the negative aliens in the Orion Group greatly plagues human society today. By combining these two NAA infiltrated organizations over time, the Vatican and Jesuit Order, these would become the merciless planetary controller mechanism for the worldwide political banking cartels. It is the center point of the satanic pillars used for the perpetuation of global blood sacrifice offerings, which are used for summoning demonic spirits and satanic alien forces that actually enter this realm through the stargate that exists under Vatican City.\n\nFrom about the 13th century, several Northern Italian aristocratic families infiltrated by the NAA's preferred lines of Khazarians much earlier, began to develop into the highest of the ruling satanic elites through the accumulation of vast wealth in the banking and merchant businesses.\n\nThese ruling elites found their wealth exploding through satanic practices of blood and child sacrifice and began to settle into the areas close to the power center of the Vatican. These wealthy Roman aristocratic families are the main lineages of the Black Nobility and Papal bloodlines whose ancestors include: the House of Sfroza, Visconti, Savoy Genovese, Torlania, Colonna, Massimo, Aldobrandini, Doria, Orsini, Farnese, Pallavicini, Ruspoli, Hapsburg, Hesse and Rothchild.\n\nAdditionally, the Jesuit Order was being structured into a male only secret military operation from about 500-years ago, which began to infiltrate these same aristocratic lineages for gaining power and control in geo-politics. Over time, the Jesuit secret oath for complete obedience to the Supreme General, who eventually became the Black Pope, progressed considerably when the secret order became influential and in full control of the obscene amount of wealth hidden in the Vatican underground vaults.\n\nThe Jesuit control over the Vatican institution further evolved into the generation of many other subsidiary organizations for handling assorted operations, such as the Military Order of Malta, along with the creation of various central banks, secret societies and cults. Many of these subsidiary organizations run by the high-ranking Jesuits were the driving force behind the creation of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization and NATO after World War II.\n\nThese are the \"globalist\" organizations that were put in place after the largest and most recent human holocaust to fully protect the monopolies represented in the international business interests that promote the same anti-human agendas of these bloodlines.\n\nThe Black Nobility, through its Jesuit connections put fascist dictator Benito Mussolini in power who established the Vatican as a sovereign nation through the Lateran Treaty of 1929, ending decades of struggle between the Italian state and the Papacy. Following the conclusion of the Lateran Treaty in 1929, the Black Nobility were given dual citizenship in Italy and Vatican City. This gave the Black Nobility full unrestrained access and unchecked power to use the Vatican as their covert business entity, installing the Black Pope and forming the Holy See Corporation, while shrouded in the veils of secrecy and fronted by the White Pope and those wearing holy robes purporting to be \"men of God\" to the religiously devoted.\n\nA top objective of the Vatican mafioso control was accumulating and concealing vast amounts of wealth from global criminal activities when deposits were made in the Swiss and Vatican bank accounts. These funds are used for money laundering and funding the overall objectives of the One World Order in favor of these satanic ruling elites.\n\nIt is rumored that many prominent political figures across the globe have bank accounts with unfathomable wealth earmarked for funding and carrying out the objectives of the Satanic Council and the Black Nobility who are enmeshed within every political, financial and governmental decision that greatly impacts the state of the nations across the globe.\n\nRecent news reveals that Switzerland had bought the rights of the company connected to the current \"back door\" voting system used globally, as well as evidence of signed affidavits and testimony given about Italy's involvement to manipulate recent elections in the United States. This goes straight up to the Black Nobility, Jesuits and the Vatican, which illustrates this point perfectly.\n\nThe Vatican remains a massive power and global control center for running the One World Order pedophilia operations for Satanic rule throughout the Controller Pillars of Society, which is overseen and managed by the Black Nobility and bloodline families.\n\nThis particular satanic agenda goes back to 2,000 years ago when the Black Sun Draconians retaliated by infiltrating the Greek sacred texts and Rome to build the Church of Rome. Thus, mock the Christos Mission and spread their violent religious rhetoric through the mind control worshipping of the false Jesus crucified in a satanic blood sacrifice that holds up the false ascension matrix and crucifixion implants.\n\nThe Vatican City in Rome is one of the NAA Black Sun entity's main control bases and global headquarters. It is the spiritual center used for carrying out the satanic ritual and operations for gaining wealth and material power for the globalist Luciferian bloodline families and funding their satanic agendas.\n\nThe top power echelon in the Vatican is secretly working with the international criminal cabal government groups, the Jesuit military orders and the luciferian bloodline families, together called the \"globalists\" to carry out blood sacrifice rituals and child trafficking in order to nourish the satanic forces on the planet.\n\nThese elaborate satanic rituals are meticulously well organized to directly communicate and interact with the anti-Christ forces mainly nonhuman entities. Through black magic sorcery, human sacrifice and blood harvesting, they receive detailed instructions from the off planet anti-Christ forces to carry out the next moves for their One World Order agenda.\n\nThese black magic rituals with child sacrifices go back to the NAA invasion and the introduction of the Kabbalah teachings, when the Artificial Tree of Life and demonic hierarchies were presented in Babylon by the Saturnian blood worshippers. This spiritual template is still being used by Satanists and Luciferians worldwide, it is their religion.\n\nSome believe they are the descendants of superior alien Gods and through the practice of blood ritual sacrifices, it gives them the means by which to contact demonic entities and their spiritual master, Satan or Lucifer and carry out his wishes.\n\nSatanists and Luciferians are masterful deceivers who cloak themselves in many assorted names and labels with clone warfare technology, which go way beyond the Church of Rome, choosing their disguise to hide behind many different religions, atheism or secret societies. This makes them appear to be separate groups, but they are actually running the world under the same unifying umbrella of hidden satanic practices for the non-human leaders of the NAA's anti-Christ agendas.\n\nSince the Atlantian Cataclysm, these practicing satanists with hybridized bloodlines sponsored by the NAA have been enslaving humanity through instigating never-ending wars, genocidal campaigns, racial discrimination, poverty and blood sacrifice. Through divide and conquer manipulation tactics and increasing world suffering they maintain control over the human race. The Vatican along with the draconian infiltration of the trained militants of the Jesuit Order, bring their combined objectives to infiltrate all world governments and cultures with the ultimate goal of achieving global satanism ruled by the prophesized return of incoming Alien False Gods.\n\nThis includes the implementation of Armageddon software and instigating wars and conflicts in partnership with the NAA. The Jesuits as well as Khazarians are behind the key soft kill methods being used in the attempt to accelerate the death rate for global depopulation and eugenic models through deploying and weaponizing multiple toxic exposures like: GMOs, vaccine injections, chemtrails, radiation, nuclear and toxic waste \"accidents\" and the transhumanist agenda.\n\nTheir sinister plan is to destroy sovereign nations and cultural identity to lay the groundwork for the one world religion, which is based upon the open acceptance of practicing Satanism by the ruling elite satanic families. The cornerstone of these depraved practices includes child marriage, child sexual abuse, child sexual rituals, human blood sacrifice, blood drinking and cannibalism.\n\nPackaged as a religion that is desired and promoted by non-human alien entities, assorted lunar forces and demonic spirits, these most vile planetary controllers carry out abhorrent anti-human agendas. Covered in opulent robes they publicly profess to be devout men of God praying for world peace, while behind closed doors the top echelon is negotiating to incite terrorism, war and run child trafficking rings to every corner of the globe.\n\nPedophilia is a prime tool used by the NAA to conquer various races, planets and solar systems. This why it is prevalent in the organizations they control such as the Vatican, the Catholic Church and Washington, DC. This destructive behavior has been genetically programmed into the alien hybridization programs with human beings in order to destroy the original 12 strand DNA Christos design of the human lightbody.\n\nConquer the earth by targeting the children as young as possible is a global mind control disease. This is one reason as to why all the world religions and organizations formed to enslave humanity by the NAA have major pedophilia problems in their leadership and representatives, even when they may not be practicing Satanists.\n\nThe Vatican and their armies have played a major role in the proliferation of global child trafficking and the pedophilia epidemic that underpins the control over global wealth. High ranking Satanists oversee an assortment of international banking and criminal activities making them the wealthiest organization on the earth.\n\nThe grotesque amount of this stolen and accumulated wealth, as well as historical ancient artifacts of our true past, remains largely unknown in its accurate scope. The Vatican's legal status as a sovereign nation with protected borders has made this wealth largely unaccounted for and tax free. However, it is known that the Catholic Church is the biggest financial power, wealth accumulator and property owner in existence on the entire planet.\n\nSadly, the most caring spiritual human beings cannot fathom the existence of such levels of pure evil and deceit designed to trick and harm human beings, or how much pain and suffering these imposter 'men of God' are being manipulated by non-human satanic forces that despise humans and enjoy causing incredible harm to human souls. Thus, the lack of accountability and unchecked power is what has allowed the Church of Rome to continue their crimes against humanity with impunity despite its long history of criminal activities, including thousands of known covered up and ongoing pedophilia cases.\n\nIt is important to discern the difference of the Vatican Power Elite and the devout Catholic followers, who have no idea the original intent of the Church of Rome and the Catholic religion was designed to be a mind control religion by invading non-human entities seeking to enslave humanity. The current levels of corruption and crimes against humanity that is taking place under our noses is unimaginable.\n\nIt is the pure love and sincere heart of human beings within the energetic structure of any distorted religion or organization that was first designed to control human beings, that can transcend this evil.\n\nBringing to the spiritual community higher qualities of compassion, empathy and peace, the sense of belonging to a group, and the genuine good will of fostering the brotherhood and sisterhood of a unified humanity.\n\nA certain level of critical mass in this awareness will be required to wake up to see this horrible corruption that the Church of Rome has exploited and manipulated in human hearts for hundreds of years. For the sincerely reverent spiritual seeker or religious devotee, this level of spiritual betrayal when learning about the facts of these atrocities will emotionally devastate and break many human hearts.\n\nThey may become traumatized and need compassionate spiritual healing. Compassionate witnessing in our truth seeking and service to others is desperately needed to help bring spiritual comfort and peace to others, with the knowledge that there is a genuine force of unconditional love that is God and Christ. However, we have been lied to and mind controlled by nefarious forces for thousands of years so humanity we will need to understand the reasons for that one day in order to spiritually heal from this betrayal.\n\nFor many of us, there has been overwhelming evidence presented for many years that satanic forces completely rule over the Vatican and the Catholic Church, and that the institution itself is rotten to the core and permeated with criminal psychopaths and pedophiles. This hard evidence is compounded by the energetic evidence found by the Starseed intuitive empaths and gridworkers.\n\nWe can well attest to the chamber of horrors of the vilest demonic forces that exist on the grounds of the Vatican, buried in layers upon layers of necropolis and dead bodies, screaming and howling trapped souls enmeshed within the interdimensional layers of the 5th dimensional access portal underground.\n\nThose in the Christos Mission that are dedicated grid workers, session workers and the sincere and purest hearts, work tirelessly to find trapped souls and free them, while supporting repair projects to the grid damage and working to rehabilitate the architecture of this sacred land, layer by layer.\n\nThe following information is a testimony to some of the work of Christos gridworkers in the Vatican over the years. This is what we have found there when working in the field in partnership with Krystal Guardian forces.\n\nThe energetic presence of satanic spiritual demonic hierarchies, negative aliens, alien machinery, soul capture devices, astral projection machinery, lunar forces and complex negative alien satanic architecture, trap and torture human souls for trafficking and generating grotesque satanic creatures.\n\nThis just scratches the surface of this anti-Christ machinery cloaked in the Vatican's sorcery, which at its energetic core is a black hole system that is used purposefully by nonhuman entities to propagate global human enslavement and spread human misery at intergalactic levels.\n\nThe Christos Magi Grail lines have been targeted for enslavement through many curses, hexes and spells directly cast from out of the Catholic religion and Vatican. This has been set up through the Orion Group Draconians who regard the order of Magi and authentic Melchizedeks as worker classes to be enslaved.\n\nTo be a worker class means they don't use them for food but seek them out directly for torture, keeping them alive as workers and sex slaves.\n\nAlien implants and suppressor parasite entities are issued through the alien Zeta Greys that are subservient to the Orion empires demand. Some human souls have been condemned to live in Grey alien worker bodies in the future timelines in Secret Space Programs, such as on Mars.\n\nThe Catholic Church is the planetary broker for the Orion Draconian groups in which the Vatican Stargate has been used as a human soul dispensary. Enslavement programs exist to harvest human souls which are being sent to other systems, other planets as brokered through their Orion group captors.\n\nOne such brokering deal is to create workers for the planet Nibiru that is harvested within this ascension cycle. Nibiru as a planet and star is closer to this planet's trajectory which allows an apparent shifting or movement of souls that have been designated for that planet in their afterlife cycle.\n\nHistorically, there have been massively sized plasma ships that arrive through the Vatican portal which acts as an interdimensional hub for the intergalactic black trade, human and child trafficking. With the Founder Solar Rishi return this is being tracked and stopped immediately when it is found, however there are timelines and many souls that require deep spiritual healing.\n\nThe Satanic stronghold in the Vatican aggressively targeted and killed the original Christ Templars in an attempt to extinguish all founder records of the Essenes and Cathars on planet. This includes destroying the knowledge of the Law of One, sacred marriage of Christos-Sophia, the Mother Arc as the Holy Spirit, and the female principle's equal role to access Christos consciousness as the true Sophia wisdom and spiritual knowledge of our Universe.\n\nNotre Dame in Paris also links to the Vatican underground through the 2D sacral center of the Artificial Tree of Life, in which the crucifixion of the Sophianic consciousness and killing of the Cathars is mocked in Black Forest hunting parties and held in place by assorted Lunar Female Demons.\n\nThe Vatican hid many of the original manuscripts of humanity's true historical records and this was intended to hide that Yeshua the Christ was married and had children, was not of immaculate conception, and that the Christ was of Cosmic \"otherworldly' origins.\n\nRecently, Guardian Host has requested support for transiting out human souls, victims of blood sacrifices in satanic ritual under Caligula's Obelisk in Vatican City. These sacrifices are connected to many obscenely wealthy Cardinals and the Papacy, which in turn are connected to the Black Nobility lineages in the energetic terrain around Rome.\n\nFor many years we have witnessed the gradual reconfiguration in the structure in the 5D gate in Vatican which has enforced these black magic grids for human blood sacrifice and collecting loosh from martyr's blood, in the name of the Black Suns' declaration of Satan as God in the Vatican City.\n\nThe Vatican is a Black Sun NAA racket with a stranglehold on global human affairs and it is clear that many Cardinals and Popes have been heavily involved in SRA and pedophilia for hundreds of years. This calls for compassionate witnessing of these timelines in which the usurping of Christ consciousness into anti-life reversals and blood sacrifice was used to power up the Vatican architecture to firmly seat its power worldwide, which is an interdimensional Black House dwelling used by practicing satanists on multiple planes.\n\nCurrently, the 5th dimensional timelines are requiring rehabilitation to correct alignment of the clock shield directions that form the Krystal compass for the base shield into the Outer World Domain. Distortions in the inner earth being generated by the Vatican's lunar demonic force hierarchy are requiring them to be evicted out for the corrections to take place.\n\nThe Outer domain emanates the organic timelines in which we experience the space time continuum and is where we reside as physical beings in the time matrix. The Outer Domain is transitioning into the actual location from which we are stationed as an identity in the organic timelines in 1D-5D on the earth plane. The Vatican satanic complex in the 5D gateways is interfering with the corrected organic timelines from the Outer domain, in which timeline and transit projects are ongoing.\n\nConsettia is a Black Dragon gestalt that sits in the 10D Qlippoth of the Pluto Matrix along with related lunar demonic hierarchy hybridized with AI that can be considered the off world enforcer of Dark Mother constructs across the globe. This has been identified for eviction in several Guardian Host architectural repair projects, which recently also includes its enmeshment with the AI systems running in the Vatican.\n\nWe have observed these gestalts protecting, supporting and backing popular or well-known politico figures that are enmeshed in the Satanic Council and related agendas. This group is an extremely vicious high dimensional AI, designed by the invading Bourgha to destroy planetary systems and harmonic universes by altering the reality through AI programming which projects incredible warring, destruction and violence.\n\nAfter gaining access into the interdimensional fields in the Vatican it spread its destructive programing into several spiritual gateways, to terrorize and attack the awakening females with Essene, Cathar and Diamond Sun Christos lineages. Thus, it is present and lurking in important historical areas in the earth, such as the island chains of the Mediterranean that are related to the Essene and Cathar civilizations that knew about the Sophianic principle of Universal Mother.\n\nThis appears to be a specific AI program deployed to destroy the true Universal Mother of Life and her Sophianic aspect, by suppressing females and males to remain energetically blocked with lunar forces saturating their gender and sexual center, so their 2D layers and sexual activity and breeding can be controlled.\n\nThe Consettia hierarchy has been known to appear to link into Black Tree of Life architecture to run dark aeonic pairing Qlippoth currents supporting the Azazael and Black Lilith pairing in Mars and Phantom Nibiru as the anti-Christos-Sophia and Anti-HG Technology infrastructure. It was feeding from the Baphomet Network and running it back through the 8D Galactic core and into the parallel fallen system of Wesedrak. Since the Winter Solstice Gold Body activation this power siphoning through the galactic core was stopped.\n\nThis is connected to the hierarchies of Dark Alien Mother that build the dark flowering architecture in blended dark matter instruction sets through AI programming code, it generates lunar forms and dark mother archetypal forces by inserting them into reversal rose or black rose grail lines in the Earth to support and maintain the Anubian Black Heart systems, another anti-life grid system.\n\nEzmeralda Archetype gestalts form an unholy trinity with Lunar Female Demonic Forces installed in the planetary body to run and promote satanic reversal energy through seduction, manipulation and princess code. They run lunar female reversals like 'damsel in distress' or femme fatale in the lightbody of humanity.\n\nThis is yet another NAA tool to suppress and enslave the Solar Feminine Christ consciousness of Mary Sophia, acting to prevent organic female embodiment potentials while males are repelled from her and attracted to the dark female. Ezmeralda has shown bindings generating triple holograms controlling horizontal rod formations connected to Ezra and Ezekiel distortions in the grid.\n\nThese bindings generate a trinity of satanic reversal black magic structures which are also designed to infiltrate the masculine layers of the human Lightbody with Dark Mother archetypal forces, binding them into reversals and energy blockages through its consciousness trap of sexual misery.\n\nThese demonic gestalts are hybridized with AI programming for off planet control and manipulation of these assortments of lunar female forces. They run negative ego programs for Luciferian superiority complexes, Princess Code, delusions of grandeur, self-entitlement through astral glamour.\n\nThese negative ego distortions block the energetic balance within the lightbody that is required for achieving the Solar Mary Sophianic Christ embodiment or authentic inner hierogamic union. The Ezmeralda gestalt is designed as an imposter spirit as it masks itself as the Mother or Goddess female consciousness, yet it is designed to stop all levels of authentic Sophianic embodiment in the female principle structure throughout the entire 12 dimensions of the Diamond Sun template.\n\nThis female imposter is connected to the Dark Mother grid network leading to interdimensional portal constructs and acts and feels like a female counterpart version of the Thothian male consciousness gestalt. Thus, it appears to be a Lunar Female force used to manipulate and procreate with the False King of Tyranny program, especially at the top of the mainstream's influential levels of celebrities, to spread public propaganda or corrupt leadership.\n\nThis arranged union is being run by the assigned demonic creature in the Pindar position which manipulates people though honey pots or dangling carrots with blackmail and bribery, for holding global political control or controlling public perception.\n\nEzmeralda gestalt have an energy resonance connected to the Gold Order's solar daughter principle of Morgana or Morgan La Fey with the conjuring of black magic satanic energy current used to infiltrate the female principle with lunar forces and binding the consciousness body to the Qlippoth current of the reversal base 10 Artificial Tree of Life\n\nGuardian host considers these Black Dragon gestalts as hybrid AI demons being connected to generate an assortment of planetary grid distortions that overlay assorted negative female archetypes. Such as in the negative ego beliefs imprinted upon twin flames or high priestess role playing that abuse sexual energy using seduction, charm and emotional or sexual manipulation, which instead are enforcing sexual misery programs that run Solar Mary Reversals or Sophianic Reversals.\n\nThis can run distorted beliefs in which females stay fixated upon incompatible male partners that are actually being manipulated by these satanic forces for setting up anti-Hierogamic unions (i.e. referred to as Alien Love Bite).\n\nThese females may believe their spiritual mission and personal role is to use their sexual energy to heal wounded males during the Ascension Cycle, when this misguided activity actually collapses the inner staff channel and pollutes the male partner's sexual center with cords from lunar forces.\n\nThese are the archetypal forces of the Dark Mother and the Lunar Female Demonic Forces working to prevent the actualization of the Solar Christ female embodiment for those individuals, while crashing organic templates of the Solar Christ male coding.\n\nThe Lunar Female Demonic Forces have been surfacing during this phase of the rise of Dark Mother and Great Transiting caused by the controlled demolition and destruction of the Baphomet Network, now further extensions are being made encompassing into the Dark Alien Mother networks in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThey may appear in assorted formats as: she-demons, Succubus, AI Demons, Black Witches, Black Widow programs, Giant Spider Beings, Black Scorpion Queens, AI Swarm Insects and Bugs, Black Skeletons, Bast or Black cat feline shadow creatures, EZ unholy trinity body parts, Black Lilith, Black Isis and Sekhmet, Achamoth spawn and more.\n\nIn this phase the hidden levels of darkness that reside in the minds and hearts of those people and organizations that are corrupted by power, wealth and depravity are being revealed to the masses.\n\nMany positive changes are occurring in the planetary architecture that may not be visible with our human eyes, but are radically shifting our consciousness landscape to where humanity must awaken to see what has really been happening behind the hidden veils of secrecy in our world.\n\nThrough spiritual initiation we are heavily tested in order to develop a strong and impenetrable relationship with our inner spirit and God. This spiritual relationship cannot be reliant on the outer and external world.\n\nThe responsibility we have to ourselves is to clear subconscious fear programs and develop spiritually and emotionally, which cannot be shifted onto others around us. We must seek spiritual connection daily to maintain our sanity, stability and clarity, when facing the outer turmoil and confusion.\n\nThe most important relationships we have is with our higher power, God, and the inner relationship we have with ourselves.\n\nWe go within to find that all we will ever need is existing inside of us for the purpose of building an impenetrable connection in our direct relationship with God, by focusing on the highest service to God that we can be in this moment. It is all that matters. This is a virtue building exercise that will build incredible spiritual power and protection.\n\nThis is that moment. We must go within and rely on the inner feeling inside our heart, the truth as we know it right now, focusing on the inner connection and being aligned to one's personal values. Praying and meditating to strengthen our direct communication with God and our inner spirit in all ways that we can.\n\nBe confident in your inner knowing that this is the event that we came to participate and witness on the earth, the massive transformation of global awakening, disclosure events and the process of catalyzing spiritual ascension of human beings on planet earth. Know the truth in your heart that this is as it needs to be, we must be willing to seek truth to embody our highest light and the time is now.\n\nPlease only take what is useful for your spiritual growth and discard all the rest. Thank you for your courage and bravery to be a truth seeker. I am God, Sovereign, Free!\n\nUntil next, stay in the luminosity of your Avatar Christos Sophia heart path. Please be kind to yourself and to each other. GSF!"

        "content": "Yesterday, the Government of The Bahamas was made aware of an indictment filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. This indictment, that involves criminal activity that commenced since at least May 2021, exposes deeply troubling allegations of corruption within our own borders.\n\nIt alleges that certain individuals within our law enforcement agencies, those sworn to protect our nation and its people, chose instead to betray that trust by facilitating drug and arms trafficking through The Bahamas.\n\nMadam Speaker, these are not isolated incidents or random breaches of conduct. The indictment paints a picture of deliberate actions, of people using their positions of authority not to defend our nation but to enable criminal networks to thrive. For years, as we fought to keep our borders secure, the very institutions meant to safeguard our sovereignty were compromised.\n\nThis revelation strikes at the core of who we are as a nation.\n\nIt is not just a failure of duty -- it is a violation of the Bahamian people's trust. These actions not only threaten and endanger our citizens but have also tarnished our nation's reputation.\n\nMadam Speaker, this House and the Bahamian people deserve answers.\n\nThe Government of The Bahamas will act decisively to ensure that those responsible for these breaches, regardless of rank or position, are held accountable.\n\nThis betrayal will not go unanswered.\n\nIn light of these serious allegations, I want to assure this House and the Bahamian people that my government will act swiftly and decisively.\n\nWe will engage with our U.S. partners and assist fully in this investigation.\n\nThe defendants will have their day in court, where the guilt or innocence of each will be established.\n\nBut we cannot wait - and we will not wait - for the outcomes of court proceedings in the United States.\n\nWe are going to use every resource - and consider every option - so that Bahamians can trust those who take an oath to protect them. This is essential. Everything is on the table. We will have change, we will have reform, and we will have action.\n\nMadam Speaker:\n\nWhile our proximity to the United States, and our vast and open waters, have long made our country vulnerable to traffickers, we are far from the only country or jurisdiction to face problems like the ones we discuss today. I will not downplay the seriousness of this moment. But I am determined for our country not to be defined by any wrongdoings of a few but instead by the urgency, the gravity, and the efficacy of our shared national response. The best of us are far more numerous and stronger than the worst of us.\n\nMadam Speaker, on at least three occasions, and as recent as earlier this year, I raised with senior members of US enforcement and intelligence agencies my deep concern over the sharp uptick in the flow of cocaine through The Bahamas.\n\nAt the time, it was clear that such an increase could not have occurred without strong intelligence pointing to who was directly involved. These revelations now underscore the validity of those concerns and reveal the extent to which this betrayal of duty undermined our nation's efforts to combat trafficking.\n\nIt is important to emphasize, Madam Speaker, that the alleged activities began at least since May 2021.\n\nFor more than three years, it has pieced together evidence that paints a damning picture of collusion and corruption.\n\nLet there be no doubt: the Bahamian people deserve accountability for every act of betrayal committed during this time.\n\nThe tree will be shaken until every bad apple falls.\n\nTo those who believe they can outsmart the systems of justice and intelligence, let this serve as a clear and stern warning: the days of operating in the shadows are over. You will be found, and you will be held accountable.\n\nTo that end, I have directed the Minister of Foreign Affairs to issue a Diplomatic Note requesting further details about allegations involving a high ranking Bahamian politician. Such allegations demand thorough investigation, and no stone will be left unturned in seeking the truth.\n\nTo clarify, the indictment states \"the defendant said that in exchange for $2 million USD, a high-ranking Bahamian politician (who was named) would authorize the assistance and involvement of Bahamian law enforcement officials.\" There is no allegation that any payments were made or authorization given. However we need to know who and the details of the allegation.\n\nMadam Speaker, we owe it to the Bahamian people to get to the bottom of this. We will root out the corruption that has allowed criminal enterprises to flourish under the guise of law enforcement.\n\nThe allegations outlined in this indictment necessitate immediate action to address the serious breaches of trust within our law enforcement institutions.\n\nToday I have requested a meeting with the Charge d'Affaires of the United States Embassy to discuss these findings and reaffirm our government's commitment to full cooperation in uncovering the truth and dismantling these criminal networks.\n\nAdditionally, I will meet with the leadership of the Royal Bahamas Police Force and the Royal Bahamas Defence Force to discuss the allegations detailed in the indictment. The Leadership of these organization must understand the gravity of this moment and the immediate need to restore the integrity of our institutions.\n\nMadam Speaker, Our security forces must demonstrate that they are prepared to uphold the highest standards of professionalism and accountability.\n\nThe Bahamian people deserve a security framework they can trust, and this government will ensure that trust is rebuilt, beginning with holding those in positions of authority accountable for these failures. Let this be the moment we commit, as a nation, to restore confidence in the institutions that serve our people.\n\nThe Bahamian people have a right to be angry. They have a right to feel betrayed. When those sworn to protect and serve our nation instead choose to exploit their positions for personal gain, it undermines the very fabric of trust that holds our society together.\n\nMadam Speaker, the indictment brought forward yesterday reveals a breach so deep that it strikes at the heart of our national security.\n\nThis is not just about criminal acts -- it is about the betrayal of the Bahamian people's faith in their institutions. Those who were responsible for protecting weapons from coming to our shores were, in fact, facilitating their arrival.\n\nThis betrayal of duty is unforgivable and has placed every citizen in harm's way.\n\nAll options are on the table to rebuild trust and restore confidence in our law enforcement agencies. The Bahamian people deserve institutions they can depend on, led by individuals who uphold the highest standards of integrity and accountability.\n\nMadam Speaker, it is our duty to ensure that the constitutional responsibility to serve the people is upheld at every level of government and law enforcement. The chips must fall where they may, and those responsible for this betrayal must face the full weight of justice. This government will act decisively to root out corruption, rebuild trust, and restore the faith of the Bahamian people in the very systems designed to protect them.\n\nBahamians deserve a police force they can trust.\n\nLet us make no mistake: the anger of the Bahamian people is not just justified -- it is a call to action, and we will answer that call.\n\nMadam Speaker,\n\nThis month, I will bring to Parliament new legislation aimed at strengthening oversight of the conduct and operations of our law enforcement agencies. This legislation will ensure that no individual or institution is above accountability. It will provide mechanisms to prevent corruption, establish clear checks and balances, and empower independent bodies to investigate and act when breaches occur.\n\nMadam Speaker, these reforms are a proactive commitment to the Bahamian people that this government will do everything in its power to rebuild trust in our institutions. We cannot allow a repeat of the failures that have been exposed, and we must create a framework that holds everyone to the highest standards of professionalism and integrity.\n\nThe Bahamian people deserve law enforcement agencies they can depend on, and this legislation will be a critical step toward ensuring that those in positions of authority are held accountable for their actions. It is time to set a new standard.\n\nMadam Speaker, this House has a responsibility to act boldly and decisively. The introduction of this legislation represents a turning point in our commitment to reforming and strengthening our institutions for the benefit of all Bahamians.\n\nMadam Speaker,\n\nWe are at a critical juncture in our nation's history -- a moment of accountability.\n\nThe misconduct of a few must not and will not define The Bahamas.\n\nWe are a proud and resilient people, and we will not allow the actions of the corrupt to tarnish our nation's reputation or compromise our future.\n\nMadam Speaker,\n\nLet me be clear: those who have betrayed the trust of the Bahamian people will be found, and they will be brought to justice. Our commitment to restoring integrity in our institutions is unbending, and this government will take every measure necessary to ensure that law and order prevail.\n\nTo the Bahamian people, I say this: your anger is heard, your frustration is understood, and your demand for action is justified. Together, we will rebuild trust, strengthen our institutions, and ensure that such betrayals can never take root again.\n\nMadam Speaker, this government stands resolute in its duty to protect the sovereignty and security of The Bahamas.\n\nThe road ahead will not be easy, but with decisive action and the will of the people, we will emerge stronger and more unified. Let us move forward with purpose and determination, ensuring that justice is served and trust is restored."

        "content": "More than 15 lakh people say Amen to Maulana Saad's prayer Four-day Ijtema concludes with special prayer Throng of devotees seen on more than 1000 acres of land and for 10 kilometers\n\nChronicle Reporter, Bhopal\n\nInternational Tablighi Ijtima held in Bhopal concludes on Sunday with the prayers of Maulana Saad. While praying for success in religion and world and for humanity, peace and brotherhood, Maulana Saad prayed at 12:15 pm and lakhs of people said Ameen together with his prayers. Before that, while giving advice to the people going to the Jamaats, he advised them to change their conduct and behavior while staying in the Jamaats. He asked them that while traveling on the way in bus and train, while walking on foot, set an example in such a way that people get to know the behavior of real Islam.\n\nThere is peace in Namaz and it is an identity of Muslim\n\nIn a very emotional manner, Maulana Saad made a special appeal to all the Muslims, elders, youth and women that they should believe in Kalima and should follow the Namaz. Namaz is the identity of a Muslim, it is a means to seek religion and world from Allah and there is peace in Namaz. Before that, in the Fajr prayer, Maulana Saad said that life is bound to end one day and the time that has passed will not come back again, so time should be valued in such a way that life passes according to the way of Allah and Rasool ( Prophet). To improve your deeds, engage in the work of Dawat. Before that, in his preaching after Maghrib prayer on Sunday night, Maulana Saad, emphasizing on the work of Dawat, said that Dawat is the practice of the Nabis and Sahaba Ikram, those who present the religion according to their own way are harming Islam at the international level. The success of a Muslim is in the order of Allah and the way of Rasool Pak. Before that, the Ulema gave speeches in Namaz Asr and Namaz Zuhr.\n\nRally of volunteers all around\n\nThere was a gathering of people on all the roads around the Ijtima site. People have been walking in a jam situation for 5 kms since morning. Apart from this, wherever the eyes could see, there were skull caps of people.\n\nShops were set up\n\nOn the call of the Ijtima Committee, the district administration had forbidden setting up any kind of market or shop on both sides of the Ijtima road.

        "content": "In addition to President-elect Donald Trump's promise that he'll be \"closing up the Department of Education,\" one of the more troubling planks of his education platform is his pledge to \"support bringing back prayer to our schools.\" How could he bring back something that never left? \"As long as there are math tests, there will be prayer in schools,\" said the late James Dunn of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty.\n\nIndeed, students' freedom to pray is protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and, contrary to what Trump's promise suggests, students are allowed to gather and pray together on school grounds. Government neutrality toward religion grants students the freedom to pray, or not pray, however they choose, without fear or favor.\n\nWhat's not allowed is government-sponsored prayer. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1962 that government-sponsored prayer in public schools violates the First Amendment. Is that the type of coercive prayer that Trump wants to \"bring back?\" Schools making students pray? Trump's school prayer charade isn't about the freedom for students to pray -- or not pray -- as their conscience dictates, but about using the power of the government to compel students to pray in a particular way.\n\nThis week, in what could be a warning sign for Trump, a federal court ruled cited a 1980 Supreme Court case and said Louisiana cannot enforce its new law requiring that the Ten Commandments be posted in every classroom in every public school in the state. The state is vowing to appeal, but the Supreme Court, as conservative as it is, has not (yet) given a green light to fully dismantling healthy boundaries between religion and government. The floodgates have not opened (yet). The type of school prayer push Trump and his allies are backing is still unconstitutional.\n\nThe fact that Trump appears to be pushing for more coercive school prayer anyway is part of his broader campaign to keep his supporters perpetually aggrieved.\n\nTo repeat: There's nothing at the moment that prohibits students at schools from praying, individually or collectively. And, yet, one commonly hears the complaint from conservative Christians of how awful it is that prayer was taken out of schools. Imagine the Supreme Court rejecting a new law or policy that would coerce students into prayer at school. That would inevitably reinforce the idea that prayer has been taken out of schools and increase the grievance that fuels Trump's political support.\n\nTrump made a school prayer push in his first term, so what's different now? The far-right religious legal movement sees a major opportunity for its cause in light of a 2022 Supreme Court decision, Kennedy v. Bremerton, involving a school football coach who'd prayed with students on the 50-yard line. In writing the opinion for a 6-3 court, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote that the coach \"offered his prayers quietly while his students were otherwise occupied\" and did not rule on his actions at midfield.\n\nUnder Gorsuch's statement of the facts, the Kennedy case did not greenlight coercive, government-sponsored school prayer. Biden's Department of Education issued updated guidance for prayer in public schools after that case, reinforcing the longstanding understanding of the Constitution: \"Teachers, school administrators, and other school employees may not encourage or discourage private prayer or other religious activity.\"\n\nEven so, there's since been a widespread push for more prayer and religious observance in public schools across the country. In addition to Louisiana's Ten Commandments law, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida passed laws allowing \"school chaplains\" in public schools.\n\n\"Groups that watch church-state issues say efforts nationwide to fund and empower religion -- and, more specifically, a particular type of Christianity -- are more plentiful and aggressive than they have been in years,\" The Washington Post reported. Proponents of more government-sponsored prayer \"see the Supreme Court as righting the American ship after a half-century of wrongly separating church and state.\"\n\nThese efforts undermine their purported cause of religious freedom. Attacking public schools is about stoking grievance among his political base and blaming problems in schools on not having government-mandated prayer. It's a tactic to spread division and incite anger.\n\nCoercing our nation's students to pray in the way Trump sees fit will do nothing but increase polarization. Obeying the government's chosen prayer does not unite us. We're united as Americans by the freedom to pray, worship and believe however we choose."

        "content": "THE above was the question asked by Britons and the rest of the world in the afternoon of May 22, 2013. Close to the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, Southeast London, two young men of British-Nigerian descent, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, had attacked a 25-year-old British Army soldier, Fusilier Lee Rigby and killed him. Rigby was of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. It was a case of religious extremism. The soldier had been on off-duty and was walking along Wellington Street. His attackers mowed him down with a car, ran towards him and, like Jack the Ripper, stabbed him multiple times with knives and cleaver. A postmortem later revealed that Rigby died of \"\"multiple incised wounds\". The two Nigerians then dragged Rigby's lifeless body to the main road and stood by, unperturbed until the arrival of the police. They proudly proclaimed to passersby that Rigby's killing was to avenge the killing of Muslims by the British military.\n\nThe two young men's Yoruba people back home were horrified because such religious intolerance and extremism do not represent them. The question the world asked as both were found guilty on December 19, 2013 and sentenced to life imprisonment was, what has God got to do with snuffing life out of God's creation?\n\nNigerians asked that same question last week from Mrs. Oluremi Tinubu, Nigeria's First Lady and the National Security Adviser, Nuhu Ribadu. Their question is, what has God got to do with suborning Him to provide solutions to problems He gave man enough brain to dissect? While this piece was going to bed yesterday, a statement was issued by Mrs. Tinubu's office by her spokesperson, Busola Kukoyi which denied that she is organising any nation prayer. It read in part: \"Her Excellency, Senator Oluremi Tinubu, CON, is not organising a national prayer... a Christian and strong advocate of prayer and praying for Nigeria, (she) believes that prayer is an act that must be done willingly, conscientiously, and sincerely. She also believes that praying for Nigeria is the responsibility of every Nigerian, irrespective of religious belief, political affiliation, tribe, or language.\"\n\nThat statement is very curious. It smacks of the usual about-turn of politically exposed persons when faced with a boomerang of their ill-thought-out decisions. It is either the First Lady's office is suffering from extreme inefficiency or there is a huge pall of subterfuge surrounding this disclaimer. The initial statement claiming Mrs. Tinubu and Ribadu would be organizing a national prayer was widely published last Monday. It took the office one whole week to distance itself from it! So, I want to go ahead with this piece, believing that the rebuttal from Mrs. Tinubu does not mirror her well-known tendency to demystify and shroud critical national issues with a blanket of religion.\n\nPeter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in the 2023 election, provoked very critical issues surrounding this matter. Drilling down into religious practices in Nigeria and churches' relations with the Nigerian state, Obi made mess of Tinubu and Ribadu's fascination with the hubris of development, rather than its science. Tinubu and Ribadu are penciled for attendance of a national prayer session that will seek \"the intervention of God\" in Nigeria's serial existential challenges in the social, economic, and security spheres.\n\nContrariwise, in a comment deploring the Nigerian state's unholy interface in religion, Obi called for reforms to Nigeria's religious and political culture. If one could squeeze sense out of his intervention, Obi simply counsels that the Nigerian state must de-couple the centuries-old alliance between it and the church (and by that very fact, Islam). \"We live largely in a very unproductive society, that's why the only thing that is attractive here is politics and church. We need to dismantle it and we're gonna turn night vigil into night shifts so people can be productive,\" he said.\n\nFor decades now, religion has received the back of the tongue of Africans. It is accused of complicity in the continent's underdevelopment. Some even say that religion's total capture of the mind of the African is akin to the owner of a farm plantation who, aiming to hinder productivity and ensure barrenness and stagnation, gives his alagbaro (labourer) palm trees-laden farm to cultivate (afún ni je mó fé á yó tíí fún ni l'óko ìdí òpe ro).\n\nObi's madness at how lowly religion has sunk in Nigeria and Oluremi Tinubu/Ribadu's decision to weaponize it in defence of the Tinubu government's lackluster performance must be put in proper contexts. There is no doubting the fact that Nigeria has become a very fertile soil for religion. The 21st century has also marked the collapse of virtually all the values preached for centuries by both Islam and Christianity. COVID-19 and the perceived insensitivity of Western religion have equally upped the disdain for Western religions. Despite reliance on Western medicine for cure, Africans went back to their roots for salvage from the brutal claws of the virus. Nigerians believe that, though their forebears sacrificed all for religion, many of them dying in the process, when it was time for the religions to come to the rescue of the congregants, the greed and acquisitive tendencies of religious barons came to the fore.\n\nImmediately the pandemic ceased its anger, churches and mosque attendance reduced. Rebellion against centuries-old orthodoxy of religion began to flourish. However, the hunger and poverty occasioned by bad leadership in Africa made Nigerians to scamper back to religion to save them. Hunger and lack are increasing church/Islam activities which include evangelistic outreaches, crusades, conferences, retreats, conventions, pilgrimages and night vigils. Religious fraudsters are more on the prowl. General Overseers are prospering from the naivety of congregants and are tweaking their baits of prosperity teachings. On the flip side, the lives of the worshippers are not getting better. There are also little corresponding spiritualities and moral growth noticeable in the lives of the people.\n\nWhile churches and mosques, as well as their leaders, are going home with loots from naïve congregants, there is a spike in cases of immorality. Recently, the RCCG suspended its pastors for homosexuality. If it cares to dig in, it will find out that lesbianism, rape, incest, theft and armed robbery abound among its clergy and laity. This can be replicated in many other churches. Among those who profess Islamic faith, you will find rabid terrorism supporters. A case in point is a former minister who publicly confessed sympathy for Al-Qaeda. Nothing happened to him. How do you, in the name of religion, support bloodshed?\n\nIt may be apt to say that, the more western religion is upon our people's heads, the more immoral and amoral they become. It must be said that, in all the ills above, Christianity seems to be the greatest culprit, far more than Islam. Miracles have become a fetish that Christian taskmasters use to hypnotize their captives. The more absent the leadership is in the lives of Nigerians, the stronger the religionists step in to offer hope. This hope is however most times fraudulent. They manipulate the people's vulnerability and impatience for a turn-around in their pain. For a deteriorating healthcare, faith-healing entrepreneurs canvass vigils in church. This, most times, leads to deaths. You only need to listen to the narrative of how, in her last days, Nigeria's Minister of Information, Dora Akunyili fell prey to these charlatans who capitalized on her religious vulnerability to make her abandon orthodox medical remedy for supposed faith healing.\n\nMiracles in Nigeria have become synonymous with baits on a rat trap. So also the \"sowing seed,\" \"tithes,\" \"first fruit\" and \"offering\" shibboleths that have become objects of exploitation by religious Smart Alecs. One of the fora where they are marketed is vigil. Publicity is then given to the \"showers of miracles\" through early morning street preaching, radio, posters, televisions and newspapers. These have been on the upswing in the 21st century. The impression you get from all this is that miracle is functional and could be offered only by these church miracle marketers. When the young ones entered the fray, with the spate of joblessness and hopelessness in the country today, the hypocrisy behind miracles is further revealed. It has led to a rash of manipulated miracles and miracle-for-cash evangelism. In some situations, noticeable among Pentecostals, some pastors are apprehended patronizing native doctors. There, human parts sacrifice, in exchange for accuracy of prophecies and obtaining power to grow large following are advertised.\n\nApart from religionists, governments and politicians also exploit religion to their advantage. Aware that religion blinds the people's ability to reason critically, they use affiliation with particular religions to recruit rabid supporters. This was what happened in the build-up to the 2023 elections. In that election, peering of religion membership in political party tickets became top issue of consideration by the electorate, rather than what the candidates were able to do for the people if elected.\n\nIn the last 18 months in Nigeria, hopelessness has pushed Nigerians more into unorthodox practices. Government daily manifests its incapacity to offer neither succor nor redemption to the people. Frustration and despondency grip the people despite federal spin doctors' spirited attempts to cobble together tissues of what they call nascent hope. It is getting clearer that government's absence from the lives of the people may be for far longer time to come. So, when Afolorunikan announced a national prayer that will feature the First Lady and Ribadu, what the people see is another plan to use religion to hoodwink them. Only a few days ago, the military apprised Nigerians of the coming together of another terrorist group in Kebbi and Sokoto states called the Lukarawas. To the people, a national prayer to ward off hunger and insecurity is government's back-door acceptance that it is helpless to bring hope in these regards. It is tantamount to accepting that everyone is for themselves and God is for us all. The NSA's presence at a prayer session supplicating to God for the security of Nigeria is akin to him throwing his hands up in resignation. Biblical King Saul did same when he, at nocturne, crawled to consult the Witch of Endor. For Ribadu to ship responsibility back to God, same responsibility that people gave him because they thought he and his boss were capable of confronting them, and thus resigning to fate as this, the hopelessness of the people will hit a higher Fahrenheit.\n\nObi's last week intervention on religion no doubt riled some regime backers and religion apostles. Speaking on a podcast, he argued that there is the need for Nigerians to shift focus from religion to productivity. \"It's attractive, politics and church, but it has to be dismantled. We are going to turn night vigil into night shift so that people can be productive.\" Obi used the two symbols of \"night vigil\" and \"night shifts\" to express growing frustration and concerns with how church Basilicas worth billions of Naira are springing up to replace empty factories and warehouses in Nigeria, and the irony the Basilicas pose as where jobless people go to plead with God to give them jobs. If you drill down into his submission however, it will seem to have brilliantly articulated the frustration of Nigerians with the alliance of politicians and religious barons. It also in a way responded to the idiotic call for prayers in Abuja to combat Nigerian government's inability to find solutions to the people's travails in its hands. Church and government have continually kept the people in the dark about their bondage using religion as the bait.\n\nApart from state funds that will be filtered into the bottomless pit of this rat race, with some Smart Alec smiling to the bank with Nigerian scarce resources, Mrs. Tinubu/Ribadu's gimmick will seem to be, de-escalate mounting tensions against the man in Aso Rock and get the people into amorphous task of holding God responsible for their woes. The end of the prayer nonsense will be nothing. Madam Tinubu should get her husband to do more than encircling the perquisites of office and bear responsibility for the stasis across Nigeria.\n\nThe truth is, we may not like Obi's bold articulation of the danger that Remi Tinubu and Ribadu's gathering poses to Nigeria's quest for mental emancipation from the chokehold of religion. Religious entrepreneurs and their Man Fridays may not like his call for \"dismantling of churches\" whose euphemism is, breaking of the walls of ignorance surrounding religion. The truth however is that we must rethink this unholy alliance if we must build a productive society. No society advances by gathering to pray against its problems. Its leaders tackle them by thinking out of the box.\n\nREAD ALSO: Massive turnout as Ayedatiwa/Adelami campaign hits Ondo West"

        "content": "Quebec ⁢City, Quebec - A controversial proposal by Quebec Premier François Legault to ban public prayer in ⁣parks⁤ and other public spaces has ignited a heated debate across Canada, raising questions about the balance between religious freedom and secularism.\n\nLegault, citing concerns about ⁢the growing visibility of religion in public life, argues that ⁤the proposed ban is necessary to uphold⁣ Quebec's secular values. \"Our goal is to ensure that all quebecers feel welcome and respected, regardless ⁢of their beliefs,\" he stated. \"Public spaces should be neutral ground where everyone can feel pleasant.\"\n\nThe proposal has drawn sharp criticism from religious groups and civil liberties advocates who argue that it infringes on basic freedoms. They contend that banning prayer in public spaces is discriminatory and sends a message that religious expression is unwelcome in Quebec.\n\n\"This is a clear attack on religious freedom,\" said David, a spokesperson for a local interfaith group. \"People⁣ should be free to express their faith in public without fear of reprisal. This proposal⁢ creates a chilling effect on religious expression and sets a⁣ hazardous precedent.\"\n\nThe⁢ debate highlights the ongoing tension between⁤ secularism and religious freedom in Quebec,a province with a long history of grappling with the⁤ role ⁣of religion ⁣in public life. While Quebec has a strong tradition of secularism,⁣ it also has a important Catholic population, and many residents value the right to express their faith openly.\n\nThe proposed ban is expected to face significant legal challenges if it is indeed passed into law. ⁢Legal experts have raised concerns about ⁤its constitutionality, arguing that it violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantees freedom of religion.\n\nThe outcome of this debate will have⁢ far-reaching implications for religious freedom ⁤and secularism in Canada. It remains to be seen whether Quebec will ultimately move forward with the proposed ban or find a way to balance the competing interests ⁤at play.\n\nNewsDirectory3.com: Dr. Dubois, thank you for joining us today. As ⁤a leading sociologist specializing in Quebec's religious landscape,⁢ could you⁣ shed ⁢some light on⁤ the public reaction to Premier ⁣Legault's proposed ban on public prayer?\n\nDr. Dubois: Certainly.⁢ This proposal has indeed sparked a firestorm of debate across Quebec ⁤and Canada. ⁢ While there's support from those who share the Premier's vision of strong secularism in public spaces, many are voicing serious concerns about infringement on religious ⁣freedom.⁤ The province has a complex ⁤relationship with religion. We have a history deeply rooted in Catholicism, yet we also prize our secular identity.\n\nNewsDirectory3.com: What are the key arguments being put forward by those who oppose the ban?\n\nDr. Dubois: Opponents argue that banning public prayer essentially silences religious expression and creates a climate of intolerance. They see it as discriminatory against religious ⁣minorities and ⁣question whether ⁣it truly promotes inclusivity⁢ as the Premier ⁤suggests. There's a strong belief that individuals⁣ shoudl have the right to express their faith peacefully in public spaces⁢ without fear ⁣of repercussions.\n\nNewsDirectory3.com: Some legal⁣ experts suggest the ban could face constitutional challenges.⁤ What are your thoughts on its legal viability?\n\nDr. Dubois: Indeed,the Canadian Charter of⁤ rights and Freedoms guarantees freedom of religion,and this ban could very well be challenged on those grounds. The courts would need to weigh the province's secular values against⁣ the⁤ basic right to religious expression. this⁢ could set a significant legal precedent for religious freedom in Canada.\n\nNewsDirectory3.com: where do you see this debate heading?\n\nDr. Dubois: ⁢ It's⁤ difficult to predict. This issue touches on deeply held beliefs about faith, identity, and the role of government. It's likely to be a long and complex process, with strong opinions ⁤on both sides. Ultimately, the ⁢outcome will shape the future of religious expression and secularism not just in Quebec, but potentially across Canada."

        "content": "An advocacy group is asking the Ascension Parish School Board to cease opening its meetings with a public prayer, saying it violates the First Amendment.\n\nHirsh Joshi, a legal fellow with the Freedom From Religion Foundation, sent the letter Nov. 26 to Ascension Parish School Board President Taft Kleinpeter. In it, Joshi said a parent had submitted a complaint to the Wisconsin-based nonprofit.\n\n\"Out of respect for the constitutional rights and diversity of all students, families, and community members, we ask that the Board cease opening its meetings with prayer,\" he wrote. \"Please respond in writing with the steps the Board is taking to address this matter so that we may inform our parent complainant.\"\n\nIn a written statement, Kleinpeter said the practice was long-standing and predates all board members, adding that it is the first time a concern has been raised.\n\n\"As elected officials, our school board members are committed to upholding decorum and adhering to their legal obligations while ensuring that all voices are respected. Maintaining a welcoming environment that reflects the values of our community is a priority for us,\" he wrote. \"Therefore, we will thoroughly look into this matter in consultation with our legal advisors regarding compliance with state and federal guidelines.\"\n\nSupreme Court cases\n\nThe nonprofit's mission is to \"promote the constitutional principle of separation of state and church,\" according to its website. In June, it joined a lawsuit challenging a Louisiana law requiring classrooms to display the Ten Commandments.\n\nIn its letter, the organization argued the Ascension school board's practice was part of the official meeting.\n\n\"Often, the member leading prayer asks everyone in attendance to bow their heads,\" it stated. \"It is our understanding that students are present at these meetings, some voluntarily for recognition, and others mandatorily for student discipline proceedings.\"\n\nJoshi added that several U.S. Supreme Court cases have ruled against similar practices, such as cases striking down school-sponsored prayers at football games and ruling formal recitation of prayer in public schools unconstitutional.\n\n\"In these cases, the Supreme Court struck down school-sponsored prayer because it is coercive and constitutes government favoritism towards religion,\" he wrote. \"Further, federal courts have held that opening public school board meetings with sectarian prayer also violates the Establishment Clause.\"\n\nThe establishment clause references a portion of the First Amendment that prohibits the government from favoring one religion over others.\n\nThe letter also referenced a 2017 case concerning prayers at school board meetings heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. That court upheld the practice of prayer at Birdville Independent School District, but Joshi argued the circumstances were different from the Ascension school board's situation.\n\nAt the Birdville meetings, students who were selected based on neutral criteria led the prayers, with some reading poems or secular statements.\n\nSimilar invocations across region\n\nThe parish has a significant Christian population, though it has decreased in recent decades. According to the Association of Religion Data, about 49.7% of the parish adhered to a Christian religion in 2020, while 61.2% did in 1980.\n\nMany events in the region also have opening prayers.\n\nMeetings for the St. James Parish School Board, Gonzales and Donaldsonville city councils and Ascension and St. James parish councils typically feature opening prayers usually led by elected officials.\n\nAnd at the July ribbon cutting for the new East Ascension High School building, a student representative of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes gave a blessing. Crosspoint Baptist Church Pastor Wes McKay led a blessing at the Prairieville High School ribbon cutting later that month.\n\nWhile the Freedom From Religion Foundation sent a letter, it has brought lawsuits against city councils and school boards over similar situations. In 2022, it won a suit against a West Virginia city council over its recitation of the Lord's Prayer.\n\nThe organization also sued the Arkansas Secretary of State in 2018 over the display of the Ten Commandments on the state capitol grounds.\n\nIn St. James, Parish President Pete Dufresne installed monuments of the Ten Commandments in front of the two parish courthouses last year. At a July council meeting, he said it was financed by him, with some private contributions coming after the monuments were installed."

I have four family members who belong to the religion they think I would mock. This is a matter that has been distorted from its purpose, and I have complete confidence in the justice system regarding this.\"\n\nLast year on May 9 in Istanbul, the trial of the defendant Devran YalÃ§Ä±n, who is accused of mocking prayer, AtatÃ¼rk, and religion in a video shared on his social media account, and who allegedly made derogatory remarks and engaged in actions that belittle worship, has begun. In the hearing held at the Istanbul Criminal Court of First Instance, the defendant Devran YalÃ§Ä±n, who is not in custody, and his lawyer Mustafa Gemici were present. In his defense during the hearing, defendant YalÃ§Ä±n stated that he was repeating his previous defenses.\n\nIn court, the entire video presented by the defendant's lawyer Gemici was watched. The defendant's lawyer stated that his client did not have criminal intent, saying, \"On the day of the incident, he made a joke as a spontaneous response to a question. The video was edited before being published. Additionally, my client has a wife from the group he is said to have belittled, and his wife is also a covered woman. The alleged actions are contrary to the ordinary course of life,\" he said. The public prosecutor, whose opinion was sought during the hearing, requested that the missing issues be addressed.\n\nThe court, announcing its interim decision, ruled that the CD presented by the defendant's lawyer should be sent to an expert along with the CD in the file to obtain a report on whether there is a difference between the two footages, and adjourned the hearing.\n\nAfter the hearing, Devran YalÃ§Ä±n stated that the incident was a huge misunderstanding, saying, \"Actually, I don't think it's a misunderstanding; I believe it was intentionally done for some interaction and gain. While I was making my broadcasts before the presidential elections, one of the friends I didn't know asked a question like, 'If KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄŸlu wins the election, will our religion be lost?' Actually, I am not someone who makes very religious or politically charged broadcasts. When the friend wrote such a question, I made some jokes using gestures and movements through satire. Do you think; 'When KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄŸlu comes to power, do we pray to AtatÃ¼rk as Ekber?' I made a satirical remark for a moment. Of course, I shared it on social media, edited like my other videos. There is absolutely no public belittlement; my wife is sitting behind you and she is covered. I have four family members who belong to the religion they think I would belittle. This is a matter that has been distorted from its purpose, and I have infinite trust in the judiciary regarding this,\" he expressed.\n\nIn the indictment prepared by the Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor's Office, it was stated that an investigation was initiated ex officio regarding the 32-second video content shared on July 8, 2023, which was of a report nature, and the person in a security uniform. The indictment stated that the suspect used expressions containing insults, derogatory, othering, hatred, hostility, and incitement regarding the political views and election-related thoughts of the Muslim community, as well as religious views and values, and also used derogatory words and actions regarding the religious act of prayer.\n\nIn the indictment, it was requested that the suspect Devran YalÃ§Ä±n be sentenced to a total of 2 years and 9 months to 10 years and 5 months in prison for the crimes of 'publicly inciting hatred and hostility' and 'publicly belittling the religious values adopted by a segment of the public.'"

        "content": "By Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons, senior director of policy and advocacy at Interfaith Alliance\n\nIn addition to President-elect Donald Trump's promise that he'll be \"closing up the Department of Education,\" one of the more troubling planks of his education platform is his pledge to \"support bringing back prayer to our schools.\" How could he bring back something that never left? \"As long as there are math tests, there will be prayer in schools,\" said the late James Dunn of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty.\n\nIndeed, students' freedom to pray is protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and, contrary to what Trump's promise suggests, students are allowed to gather and pray together on school grounds. Government neutrality toward religion grants students the freedom to pray, or not pray, however they choose, without fear or favor.\n\nWhat's not allowed is government-sponsored prayer. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1962 that government-sponsored prayer in public schools violates the First Amendment. Is that the type of coercive prayer that Trump wants to \"bring back?\" Schools making students pray? Trump's school prayer charade isn't about the freedom for students to pray -- or not pray -- as their conscience dictates, but about using the power of the government to compel students to pray in a particular way.\n\nThis week, in what could be a warning sign for Trump, a federal court ruled cited a 1980 Supreme Court case and said Louisiana cannot enforce its new law requiring that the Ten Commandments be posted in every classroom in every public school in the state. The state is vowing to appeal, but the Supreme Court, as conservative as it is, has not (yet) given a green light to fully dismantling healthy boundaries between religion and government. The floodgates have not opened (yet). The type of school prayer push Trump and his allies are backing is still unconstitutional.\n\nThe fact that Trump appears to be pushing for more coercive school prayer anyway is part of his broader campaign to keep his supporters perpetually aggrieved.\n\nTo repeat: There's nothing at the moment that prohibits students at schools from praying, individually or collectively. And, yet, one commonly hears the complaint from conservative Christians of how awful it is that prayer was taken out of schools. Imagine the Supreme Court rejecting a new law or policy that would coerce students into prayer at school. That would inevitably reinforce the idea that prayer has been taken out of schools and increase the grievance that fuels Trump's political support.\n\nTrump made a school prayer push in his first term, so what's different now? The far-right religious legal movement sees a major opportunity for its cause in light of a 2022 Supreme Court decision, Kennedy v. Bremerton, involving a school football coach who'd prayed with students on the 50-yard line. In writing the opinion for a 6-3 court, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote that the coach \"offered his prayers quietly while his students were otherwise occupied\" and did not rule on his actions at midfield.\n\nUnder Gorsuch's statement of the facts, the Kennedy case did not greenlight coercive, government-sponsored school prayer. Biden's Department of Education issued updated guidance for prayer in public schools after that case, reinforcing the longstanding understanding of the Constitution: \"Teachers, school administrators, and other school employees may not encourage or discourage private prayer or other religious activity.\"\n\nEven so, there's since been a widespread push for more prayer and religious observance in public schools across the country. In addition to Louisiana's Ten Commandments law, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida passed laws allowing \"school chaplains\" in public schools.\n\n\"Groups that watch church-state issues say efforts nationwide to fund and empower religion -- and, more specifically, a particular type of Christianity -- are more plentiful and aggressive than they have been in years,\" The Washington Post reported. Proponents of more government-sponsored prayer \"see the Supreme Court as righting the American ship after a half-century of wrongly separating church and state.\"\n\nThese efforts undermine their purported cause of religious freedom. Attacking public schools is about stoking grievance among his political base and blaming problems in schools on not having government-mandated prayer. It's a tactic to spread division and incite anger.\n\nCoercing our nation's students to pray in the way Trump sees fit will do nothing but increase polarization. Obeying the government's chosen prayer does not unite us. We're united as Americans by the freedom to pray, worship and believe however we choose."

He was previously the executive director of middle and K-8 schools for Springfield Public Schools.\n\nAt the time, Methvin confirmed the prayer was held during the Welcome Back Staff Celebration meeting a week before the first day of class.\n\nHe said the meeting covered a range of topics, including construction updates, resources available to teachers and the welcoming of new employees. According to the district, it is the only staff meeting where a prayer is given.\n\nIn a news release Wednesday, the foundation quoted from a letter than Methvin wrote: \"We will not be holding prayer over future staff meetings.\"\n\nAnnie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of the foundation, said the district acknowledged the error. \"Official prayer steamrolls over the diversity of belief and nonbelief among school staff.\"\n\nAccording to the nonprofit watchdog, public schools may not show favoritism toward or coerce belief or participation in religion.\n\nThe foundation's Patrick O'Reiley Legal Fellow Hirsh Joshi, an attorney licensed in Missouri, wrote: \"It's important that, even in rural Missouri, the First Amendment is respected and religion is kept out of the government's official practice. We thank the district for cooperating and wish them and their staff nothing but the best for this school year and the ones to come.\"\n\nThe group said giving only Christian teachers the benefit of prayer is unlawful preference for Christianity. The national nonprofit has 40,000 members, including 500 in Missouri."

        "content": "The debate over whether Islam can affirm freedom of conscience and the separation of religion and state rages. A new book adds welcome fuel to the intellectual fires.\n\nOnce in a while a new book in religious studies comes out with a bold thesis, challenging old assumptions and raising some eyebrows. The Islamic Secular, a thick, dense, and elaborate monograph by Sherman A. Jackson, Distinguished Professor of Religion at the University of Southern California, is one such book that deserves attention -- by both Muslims and others who are interested in the destiny of Islam.\n\nThe book is notable first because of its author: Prof. Jackson, an African American who converted to Islam at a young age only to become one of the most prominent Muslim scholars in the Western world. He has also been named several times, most recently in 2023, as one of the 500 most influential Muslims in the world by the Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Center in Amman, Jordan. His earlier books, including Islam and the Problem of Black Suffering and On the Boundaries of Theological Tolerance in Islam: Abū Hāmid al-Ghazālī's Faysal al Tafriqa, were widely read and rightly praised.\n\nThe Islamic Secular, perhaps Jackson's magnum opus, at least so far, is notable also for the provocative thesis that is apparent right in its title. For many people, including Muslims themselves, the very terms \"Islamic\" and \"secular\" appear contradictory, and their amalgamation would coin only an oxymoron. But Jackson carefully makes sense of what he means by \"the Islamic Secular\": that Islamic law, namely the Shari'ah, does not cover all the vast areas of human experience and knowledge, leaving many spaces that are \"secular,\" where Muslims can still act and think with a religious ethos. It means, in his words,\n\nWhile everything remain[s] within the purview of the divine gaze of the God of Islam, not everything [can] be determined by Shari'ah or on the basis of its revelatory sources. Various aspects of state-policy, the economy, science, and the like [are] \"differentiated,\" from Shari'ah and its revelatory sources, without becoming non-religious or un-Islamic.\n\nOne may wonder why this is not obvious. It is not because there is also a \"totalizing\" view of the Shari'ah, which assumes that Islamic law should define anything and everything -- from personal practices to politics, from economics to all sciences. Jackson finds this \"totalizing\" view in the narrative of the political Islamist movements, which typically insist that \"Islam is the solution\" to any worldly problem that one can imagine. They also insist, in Jackson's words, \"that the Islamic State must apply the shar', the whole shar', and nothing but the shar'.\" (Shar' is a cognate of Shari'ah.)\n\nBounded vs. Unbounded Shari'ah\n\nJackson ties the resurgence of this \"totalizing\" view of Islamic law to \"fears about the encroachments of Western secularism.\" But, as he notes, it was also present in the premodern Islamic tradition. It goes all the way back to Imam Al-Shafi'i (d. 820), who is widely recognized as the founder of not only one of the four Sunni schools of jurisprudence but also the very architect of the legal methodology that other Sunnis largely followed. In his seminal book Al-Risala, Al-Shafi'i attacked the more rationalist jurists of his time (the \"ahl al-ray,\" or \"people of reason\"), who besides revelation used their intuitive ethical judgements (called \"istihsan\"), reflecting an Islamic strain of natural-law-based thinking. According to Al-Shafi'i, however, reason without revelation was always untrustworthy, and hence revelation had to be all-encompassing. \"No situation befalls anyone who adheres to the religion of God,\" he famously wrote, \"but that there is in the Book of God an indication regarding the correct action therein.\" This resulted in a concept of \"unbounded Shari'ah,\" which dominated the formative centuries of Sunni jurisprudence.\n\nThis was not the only view, however, as Jackson painstakingly shows in the book. Instead, he argues, Islamic jurists gradually realized the limits of Islamic law, and by the 11th century, it was rather the \"bounded\" view of the Shari'ah that became more pronounced. He points to examples such as the great Imam al-Ghazali (d. 1111), who defined \"mathematics, geometry, astronomy\" as aqli, or \"rational\" areas of human knowledge, as opposed to naqli, or \"transmitted\" religious knowledge. Another one is Ibn Aqil (d. 1119), who also saw the pursuits of \"grammar, medicine, lexicography\" as outside the purview of Islamic law -- in other words, as \"secular.\"\n\nThroughout The Islamic Secular, Jackson both resurrects this \"bounded\" view of Islamic law and applies it to modern circumstances. He builds the ground for a conceptual shift, which indeed would be an important contribution to contemporary Islamic thought. \"The Islamic secular\" can indeed help invalidate the \"totalizing\" ambitions of political Islamists, who theorize a simple \"Islamic\" solution to any complex problem, often with unfortunate results in practice. It can also help ease the intuitive suspicion many conservative Muslims have against modern sciences, philosophies, laws, and institutions. It can help Muslims walk the world more confidently, by keeping one leg in the religious texts but the other one in universality, without collapsing into existential crisis.\n\nWhat About the Shari'ah Itself?\n\nHowever, laying the boundaries of the Shari'ah still does not resolve the issues within the Shari'ah -- and that is the part of the book where Jackson's approach may begin to look inadequate.\n\nOf course, one may not see any \"issues within the Shari'ah,\" especially if his or her only guide is the Shari'ah itself. But for most outsiders, as well as for many Muslims who think outside the box, there are issues: The Shari'ah, as articulated by the traditional schools of jurisprudence, has verdicts that conflict with modern standards of human rights, in areas such as religious freedom, freedom of expression, and equality under the law regardless of religion and gender.\n\nJackson frankly notes that \"the Islamic Secular alone... has no direct response to this problem.\" But he has another response to the problem, with which I would not agree: to argue that religiously coercive elements of the Shari'ah may be just fine.\n\nThis is evident in one of the most interesting chapters of the book, \"The Islamic Secular and the Secular State,\" where Jackson critically engages with another American Muslim academic, Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im. (In other chapters, Jackson also engages with the perspectives of Wael Hallaq and Andrew March, all insightful and interesting discussions.)\n\nAn-Na'im, Charles Howard Candler Emeritus Professor at Emory Law School (who has spoken at Acton), deserves a little introduction here. He is originally from Sudan, where he saw what religious coercion can do: His own teacher Mahmoud Mohammed Taha was cruelly executed for \"apostasy\" for merely interpreting the Qur'an differently. An-Na'im's 2008 book, Islam and the Secular State, called for ending all such abuses by placing Islam in its rightful place -- the individual conscience -- and through a political shift: separation of the Shari'ah and the state, making the observance of the former a voluntary choice, not a dictate of the latter. (On all these points I fully agree with An-Na'im, as I have argued elsewhere: \"All religious aspects of sharia -- such as prayer and fasting, as well as dress codes and sexual mores -- should not be enforced by state power, but practiced by faith, like the Jewish halakha.\")\n\nIs Coercion Good for Religion?\n\nBut Jackson disagrees with An-Na'im. First, he objects to An-Na'im's reading of Islamic history -- on whether the separation of the Shari'ah and the state is really \"the normative relationship\" -- and he may have a point there. But he also criticizes An-Na'im for \"seeing no positive role at all for coercion\" owing to \"the liberal view of heteronomy as archenemy.\" Jackson then explains why religious coercion may actually have a \"positive role\":\n\nMy point here is that certain practices are likely to produce certain enduring effects, regardless of their practitioners' sincerity or intentions. ... Something similar can be said about Islamic law as practice: observing its dictates breeds or at least contributes to the instantiation of a particular subjectivity, a mode of being in the world, and even the instantiation of virtues, all independent of intention. ... Even forced prayer can ignite a spiritual spark, or at least reinforce the normativity of prayer as a value.\n\nNo wonder that, with this line of reasoning, medieval Islamic scholars imposed harsh punishments on Muslims who \"gave up prayer.\" Even today, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan dictate such practices as strict dress codes for women. (This is not to say that Jackson justifies the policies of Iran and the Taliban, but if religious coercion is good for \"reinforcing normativity,\" then why would those policies not be justified?)\n\nThis is perhaps the most interesting discussion in Jackson's multifaceted book, and if I had a chance, I would add a counterpoint: The \"liberal view\" he deprecates also has a religious justification. It is that religious coercion, far from helping religion, can corrode it by generating hypocrisy and resentment among those who are coerced. This was one of the key objections John Locke raised against religious coercion in A Letter Concerning Toleration. It is also painfully obvious in Iran today, where decades of \"reinforcing normativity\" by the Islamic Republic have made millions of people not more religious but only more secular, if not fiercely anti-religious. (There is also a lesson here for Christian post-liberals, as I have argued elsewhere.)\n\nTo his credit, Jackson also notes that \"An-Na'im logic,\" meaning noncoercion in religion, \"is not entirely alien to the Islamic juristic tradition.\" He reminds us of the prominent Sunni scholar Shihab al-Din al-Qarafi (d. 1285), who barred the state \"from intervening in 'religious observances and the like,'\" and with a notably Lockean concern: \"The sole purpose of [religious observance] is to extol and worship God, which cannot be realized in the absence of the worshipper's proper intention.\" But al-Qarafi was not \"entirely consistent,\" Jackson adds, as he also accepted \"punishment for abandoning prayer.\" Hence I would see the former point by al-Qarafi as a \"seed of freedom\" in the Islamic tradition, among others, which wasn't cultivated enough in the past, but which can be cherished today.\n\nIn fact, \"the Islamic secular\" itself can be a seed of freedom that can be taken further than Jackson does in his book. For if there are rational areas of human knowledge and practice, not necessarily defined by religion but in which the religious can act ethically, why can't we add governance and legislation to them? Why can't we even see the Shari'ah's interventions in these areas not as enduring enactments but as contextual applications of universal principles -- as various \"Islamic modernists\" have been arguing since the late 19th century?\n\nI am not sure whether Jackson himself would go that far, but his thought-provoking book is full of facts and insights that could spark many rich conversations about the place of Islam in the modern world. For anyone interested in that big question, it is a must-read."

        "content": "Sammanfattning: In this thesis civil religion in the Czech Republic is studied throught the way it is expressed in the speeches of president Václav Havel. Earlier studies on civil religion have shown how civil religiion can be a latent phenomenon that is activated in times of societal change and crisis. In Havel's speeches, this is expressed by the emphasis put on democratic values, such as basic human rights, and the return of history to a country that was subjected to a totalitarian regime during a long period of time. Through the analysis of Havel's speeches from 1990-1999, the elements and symbols of the Czech civil religion become evident. These elements and symbols are found in the history of the nation, and Havel often emphasizes how important it is to know the truth about history. An important factor in this research is the need for an overarching civil religion, that could tie the citizens to the state, as well as to each other. This need arose as communism was ousted and the society started changing rapidly. The developing society became differentiated, and a religious indifference prevailed. This made it impossible for the established religion to encompass all the citizens and create cohesion in soicety, thereby legitimating it. The foundation of the Czech civil religion are democratic and liberal values, something that makes it a general civil religion. It has, however, specific, Czech elements, namely the notions of truth, freedom, tolerance and unity. A special form of unity formed among the citizens durig the struggle for freedom in 1989, and Havel played an important part in the development. This has given him great influence over the citizens, and he has had the possibility to shape the civil religion, so that it includes the elements that he finds important. He puts special emphasis on national holidays and commemorations, that form a civil religious calendar and make it possible to hold symbolic manifestations that create a unity among the citizens. The main task of the civil religion in the Czech Republic is to tie the different spheres of society together, thus forming a common basis of values, on which society rests and through which society is legitimated."

This essay challenges the assertions made in that essay.\n\nLaser argues that there is a separation of church and state in the nation's ethos that forbids anyone expressing their religion in the public square. In reality this is a direct contradiction of the national ethos as expressed in the First Amendment's prohibition against the government passing any law proscribing a citizen's right to freely express their religion.\n\nShe supports plaintiffs suing to end abortion restrictions who argue such restrictions are an unconstitutional insertion of other's religion into public policy. Laser's argument, with no historical or constitutional basis, would mean that a Baptist could not pursue prohibition nor a Catholic abortion bans.\n\nLaser and the plaintiffs are insisting that the entire national community accept their values. She and the plaintiffs are arguing for and pursuing fundamental values arising out of their own belief system, a devout secularism, if you will, but want everyone to think they are not bringing any religion into the public square. Of course they are. Laser must proceed as she does so all other value sets can be banned.\n\nIn all civilizations politics is a reflection of culture and culture is a reflection of religion, that is the ultimate values and understanding of reality that a people, in order to be a people, hold in common. The founding fathers insisted and admonished the citizenry that the United States could not long endure absent a Christian ethos that would inform public policy. Americans, as Tocqueville noted, inextricably intertwined free religious faith and expression with free government, the one supporting the other\n\nIn the 1990s, President Clinton and Democrats and Republicans in congress reiterated that sentiment with passage and signing of the Freedom of Religion Restoration Act. Clinton strongly insisted Americans had a constitutional right to bring their religion into the public square, to have faith inform public policy. This all got obscured with President Obama's insistence that Americans needed to leave their religion at home and by the simultaneous stepped-up drive to ban challenges to new gender understandings and to abortion understood as solely an individual matter.\n\nLaser also insists that the public cannot post the Ten Commandments. The Ten Commandments can be displayed so long as the motive is not to privilege a particular religion. The doors of the Supreme Court building and the wall behind the justices' seats have an inscription of the Ten Commandments denoting a Western civilization well-spring -- the rule of Law. Also, contrary to Laser's belief set, the bible can be taught in public schools as cultural/historical study, not proselytizing. Otherwise it would be very difficult to teach the nation's heritage, western civilization, at any level of public education.\n\nLaser upends reality by creating a bogeyman, the White Christian Nationalist who, she writes, does not represent America's core values, that is, her values. But there are very few Americans pursuing a racist, white nation. There are, however, a lot of white and black Americans seeking to preserve a national Christian ethos that had triumphed over slavery and racism and that until the 1970s had united Americans in a common understanding of gender/family, free speech, religious freedom, and pride in nation. In using the slur she ridicules the Christian ethos that has undergirded the nation.\n\nBack to western civilization, informed as it is by the Judeo-Christian religion. Ms. Laser pursues her moral/ethical understanding and her definition of religious freedom in direct opposition to the old western morality, that in turn informs such traditional values as real religious freedom and self-governance. She must argue as she does and disparage those who hold to traditional values because to achieve her vision of separation of church and state with only her religion in the public square there must be an end to western civilization."

        "source": "American Affairs Journal",
        "content": "One day in the early 2000s, a goth teenager by the name of Sohrab Ahmari was perusing the shelves of a Salt Lake City bookstore when his gaze landed upon Friedrich Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra. For a misfit atheist adolescent looking for meaning in life outside the bleak conditions of the majority-Mormon trailer park he resided in, the encounter turned out to be love at first sight. Ahmari recalls in his memoir, \"To say that I 'read' Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra would be an understatement. I took the book home from the store, lay belly down on my bed, and finished it over three or four days, barely stepping out to eat and wash. I consumed Zarathustra, and it consumed me, in turn.\" Soon after accepting Nietzsche as his (anti-)messiah, Ahmari became \"quite literally a card-carrying communist.\" Indeed, when the Straussian professor Allan Bloom bemoaned Nietzsche-quoting radicals on college campuses in his classic polemic The Closing of the American Mind (1987), he was referring to left-Nietzcheans like the teenaged Ahmari, those that squared Nietzsche's aristocratic radicalism with a grand project of ultimate equality.\n\nIn the present day, however, Ahmari is no longer the angsty Nietzschean of his youth. Like most goth teenagers learn when they become adults, it was just a phase, after all. Having dropped Dionysius on his road to Damascus, Ahmari is now a Catholic convert who pens polemics against \"America's dime-store Nietzscheans.\" These new Nietzscheans have somehow left the Left and have appeared on the right, taking up terminally online noms de guerre like Bronze Age Pervert and L0m3z. Yet such a dramatic difference in political usage is not surprising to those who have known the work of Nietzsche and the rich history of interpretations of his thought in the United States.\n\nNietzsche once wrote that there was only ever one true Christian, and that he died on the cross. In the same vein, one can say that there was only ever one true Nietzschean, and by the time his monographs landed in American bookstores in the 1890s, he was already confined to his sister's attic, his mind in the throes of madness after decades of battling intractable migraines. If Nietzsche had stayed sane enough to know of his burgeoning fan base across the pond, he may have delighted in this cultural exchange. After all, before Nietzsche's work came to America, America came to him, in the form of the Transcendentalist philosophy of Ralph Waldo Emerson.\n\nAs a teen, Nietzsche had discovered Emerson's works and read them as thoroughly as Ahmari read Nietzsche. Nietzsche and Emerson had similar life trajectories: they were both Pfarrerskinder (preacher's chil­dren) who later abandoned their ministerial upbringings to launch philosophies of radical individualism. Nietzsche's Emerson volumes were the most heavily annotated books in his personal library, with the marginalia full of praise for Emerson's reflections on the nature of the free-spirited individual, outside tradition and convention. Nietzsche apparently saw Emerson as his \"twin soul.\"\n\nAmerica has long served as a place where people go to break free from tradition and convention, beginning with Puritans and Quakers fleeing religious persecution down to present-day celebrations of America as a \"nation of immigrants\" and \"land of opportunity.\" So it is perhaps no surprise that an Emerson-inspired champion of free spirits would find an audience here.\n\nConversely, some American interpreters specifically embraced Nie­tzsche as a critic of American philistinism; they found in Nietzsche's Teutonic profundity an escape from an America they saw as too capital­istic, democratic, Christian, and/or anti-intellectual to ever produce worthwhile philosophy. Thus, Nietzsche has always had a Janus-faced appeal on this side of the Atlantic: he was, on the one hand, a seemingly Americanized philosopher whose work resonated with American ideals but, on the other, a German philosopher whose superior European intellect revealed the shallowness of American culture.\n\nThe very fact that Nietzsche's philosophy was able to inspire such contradictory interpretations points toward another aspect of American exceptionalism. The theologian Tara Isabella Burton describes how the Enlightenment reshaped Western metaphysics away from imagining humans as actors in a God-created world and toward the invention of the autonomous individual able to create one's own destiny, thus allowing humans to \"become gods.\" This led to the notion of \"aristo­cratic individualism\" in western Europe, the belief that a select few \"natural aristocrats\" could make themselves into godlike beings. By contrast, the American ethos was shaped by democratic individualism and free market capitalism; anyone, at least in theory, could become a \"self-made man\" as long as he had enough entrepreneurial flair and the (Protestant) work ethic to make things happen. Thus, while Euro­pean interpretations of Nietzsche often involved narratives in which an Übermensch claimed his \"deserved\" place in the social hierarchy, Amer­ican interpretations emphasized unshackling oneself from societal con­straints (such as Christian morality) and (re)creating one's own \"truth\" and values in a journey of self-actualization.\n\nThis democratic ethos is captured by the homegrown American pragmatist school of philosophy most notably espoused by William James, Emerson's godson. Pragmatism, at the risk of oversimplification, views truth as a flexible canvas, ready to accommodate whatever beliefs prove the most useful to the truth-seeker. It is a democratizing and individualizing philosophy that allows for the value of various interpretations rather than elevating one eternal or universal truth. Many early American interpreters of Nietzsche immediately saw similarities be­tween Nietzsche's ideas and American pragmatism. The pragmatic American mind allowed for Nietzsche's work to be utilized in whatever way the readers saw fit, and sure enough, American thinkers produced a dizzying array of interpretations.\n\nNietzsche also achieved a unique resonance in America because he was known for being a critic of Christianity in a country that has retained Christian belief for much longer than other Western countries. As Christian practice has fallen away in Europe, the United States -- also known as Providence, the shining city upon a hill, and one nation under God -- has been the one Western liberal democracy that has maintained a strong Christian culture. Fears of an impending right-wing Christian theocracy have been a common theme on the American left over the past few decades, from the Reagan-era \"Moral Majority\" panic to the Bush-era \"theocon\" scare to contemporary cris de coeur against Chris­tian nationalism -- fears that are generally absent in Western European coun­tries, where the only feared theocracy is an Islamic one. As such, Western critics of Christianity from the Right have mostly been European thinkers such as Oswald Spengler and Dominique Venner, many of whom were practicing neo-pagans. While other Western countries were already operating in a post-Christian landscape, and thus had little use for criticisms against an irrelevant faith, the continuing relevance of Christianity in America has also meant the continuing relevance of Nietzsche as Christianity's critic-in-chief.\n\nAs Nietzsche wrestled with madness in Germany, eventually succumbing to his illness in 1900, his work became a sensation in America, with ideologues of all stripes laying claim to this new titan of Teutonic thought. No individual of the era did more to popularize Nietzsche than H. L. Mencken, a journalist known for his boisterous and scathing cultural commentary, published in his columns in the Baltimore Sun or the American Mercury. In 1908, Mencken published The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, the first full-length English-language book on Nietzsche's thought for a mass audience. Not that Mencken was par­ticularly fond of mass audiences: like his idol Nietzsche, Mencken openly expressed his contempt for democracy, preferring the select few over the hoi polloi.\n\nMencken's other idée fixe was Christianity, which he claimed \"lays its chief stress, not upon the qualities of vigorous and efficient men, but upon the qualities of the weak and parasitic.\" Not content to just attack Christianity as a whole, Mencken specifically bemoaned what he saw as the continuing influence of Puritanism in American culture long after the actual Puritans lost power: \"The Puritan's utter lack of aes­thetic sense, his distrust of all romantic emotion, his unmatchable intolerance of opposition, his unbreakable belief in his own bleak and narrow views, his savage cruelty of attack, his lust for relentless and barbarous persecution -- these things have put an almost unbearable burden upon the exchange of ideas in the United States. . . .\" Mencken linked Nietzsche's concept of cultural philistinism -- of the vapid rabble obsessed with conformity over free thought -- to an American neo-Puri­tan spirit that sought to drag down those who dared to think differently.\n\nIn attacking two of America's most sacred value systems, democracy and Christianity, Mencken did indeed stand out against most Americans of his era, as did the others drawn to Nietzsche at the time. Anarchists, feminists, reactionaries, Marxists, atheists, libertarians, and other ideo­logues deeply dissatisfied with the cultural ennui of Gilded Age America all gathered around Nietzsche's radical rhetoric and polemical prose, taking Nietzsche's alluring concepts and using them for their own ends, letting a thousand interpretations bloom. The process usually followed along these lines: first, the budding Nietzschean would identify what seemed to be the \"slave morality\" and \"ressentiment\" of American society, especially in its espousal of Christian or democratic values, values which were deemed no longer relevant after the \"death of God.\" The American Nietzscheans would then propose that their ideology -- ranging all the way from Max Eastman's anti-capitalist socialism to Ayn Rand's hyper-capitalist Objectivism -- would overcome America's stag­nation, liberating the will to power of their preferred Übermenschen.\n\nA major flashpoint in the American reception of Nietzsche's philoso­phy was the case of Leopold and Loeb. These preternaturally gifted teenagers kidnapped and murdered the fourteen-year-old scion of a wealthy Chicago watch manufacturer in an attempt to pull off the \"perfect crime\" and prove themselves as Nietzschean Übermenschen, unconstrained by laws and slave morality. Their plan almost worked, except that Leopold's custom-made glasses were accidentally dropped near the boy's dead body, allowing police to use Leopold's human, all-too-human mistake to zero in on the two as the perpetrators.\n\nIn what was perhaps prematurely dubbed the \"trial of the century,\" famed defense attorney Clarence Darrow gave an impassioned eight-hour speech arguing against capital punishment for the teens. Darrow pointed out Nietzsche's enormous popularity in academia, noting that\n\nThere is not a university in the world where the professors are not familiar with Nietzsche, not one: There is not an intellectual man in the world whose life and feelings run to philosophy that is not more or less familiar with the Nietzschean philosophy. . . . Is there any blame attached because somebody took Nietzsche's philosophy seriously and fashioned his life on it? . . . Your honor, it is hardly fair to hang a 19-year-old boy for the philosophy that was taught him at the university. It does not meet my ideas of justice and fairness to visit upon his head the philosophy that has been taught by university men for twenty-five years.\n\nDarrow was ultimately successful in persuading the judge to spare Leopold and Loeb from the electric chair, a compassionate move that was perhaps, ironically, a demonstration of the slave morality the duo so opposed. It would not even take a year, however, for Darrow to be embroiled in yet another \"trial of the century\": the so-called Scopes monkey trial.\n\nDarrow defended John Scopes, a teacher accused of violating a Tennessee law banning the teaching of evolutionary theory in schools. William Jennings Bryan, a thrice-failed presidential candidate and a fundamentalist Christian, served as counsel for the prosecution. Not surprisingly, it was none other than Mencken who provided the most scathing mocker­ies of the Christian fundamentalists, penning multiple columns against the \"hill-billies\" and \"yokels\" in the Bible Belt (a term Mencken coined) who clung to their creationist beliefs against the tides of modernity. While the prosecution was ultimately successful in convicting Scopes, it was a Pyrrhic victory, for Bryan's poor performance became an embar­rassment to Christian creationists across America. Not even Bryan's sudden death a few days after the trial could quiet Mencken's onslaught, as Mencken published not one but two obituaries denigrating Bryan's life and Christian beliefs.\n\nThe Scopes Monkey Trial was ostensibly about evolution, but it mainly served as a proxy battle in the war over the question of what exactly Christianity was to be in modern times. This trial occurred against the backdrop of the fundamentalist-modernist controversy rag­ing among American Protestants. Modernists adhered to Enlightenment liberal principles and declared that evolution by natural selection was compatible with Christianity, while fundamentalists reacted against modernism, taking up positions like Biblical inerrancy as a response. Many modernists were also involved in the Social Gospel movement of the time, accepting new scientific developments and working to address broader social issues, while fundamentalists rejected these currents.\n\nWhereas fundamentalist theologians were resistant to outside cri­tiques of Christianity, there were a surprising number of modernist theologians who used Nietzsche's work to interrogate their own beliefs. After all, Nietzsche's criticisms of Christianity did not challenge Chris­tian metaphysics but rather its morality. Christians could accept and even celebrate Nietzsche's historical evaluation of Christian morali­ty while still maintaining the existence and divinity of the Christian God.\n\nOne such interpretation came from Reinhold Niebuhr, the most influential American-born theologian of the twentieth century. Niebuhr and Nietzsche were both Pfarrerskinder of German heritage. But unlike his fellow Pfarrerskinder, Nietzsche and Emerson, Niebuhr stayed within the Christian confines of his upbringing; for him, Nietzsche's interpretation of Christian morality offered grounds for further affirma­tion of this teaching. In his sermon \"Transvaluation of Values,\" Niebuhr begins by quoting 1 Corinthians:\n\nFor ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: That no flesh should glory in his presence.\n\nNiebuhr then underscores just how radical a claim Paul made:\n\nThe Apostle Paul could hardly have given Nietzsche's quarrel with Christianity a clearer justification than we find in these uncompromising words. . . . Nietzsche is quite right. Christianity does transvalue historical values. . . . The Christian faith is cen­tered in one who was born in a manger and who died upon the cross. This is really the source of the Christian transvaluation of all values. The Christian knows that the cross is the truth. In that standard he sees the ultimate success of what the world calls failure and the failure of what the world calls success.\n\nInstead of viewing Nietzsche's criticisms of Christianity as attacks to be parried, Niebuhr posits Nietzsche's critique as Christianity's ultimate triumph: that Christianity's sine qua non is in fact slave morality, and the fact that Christianity became the world's dominant religion is living proof that the slaves have triumphed over the masters, that the pagan gods that symbolized vitality and beauty were successfully replaced by the one true God that inverted Greco-Roman values via the sacralization of a symbol of an emaciated Jew nailed to a slave-executing apparatus.\n\nNiebuhr's most influential student, the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., another Pfarrerskind, would demonstrate this triumph of Christian slave morality by successfully leading the largely nonviolent American civil rights movement. Today, King is one of three figures to have his birthday designated a federal holiday in the United States, the other two being George Washington and Jesus Christ.\n\nThe theologian James Cone, founder of black liberation theology, even drew a direct link between the term \"slave morality\" and the de­scendants of American chattel slavery, writing that,\n\nThe lynched black victim experienced the same fate as the crucified Christ and thus became the most potent symbol for understanding the true meaning of the salvation achieved through \"God on the Cross.\" Nietzsche was right: Christianity is a religion of slaves. God became a slave in Jesus and thereby liberat­ed slaves from being determined by their social condition. The real scandal of the gospel is this: humanity's salvation is revealed in the cross of the condemned criminal Jesus, and humanity's salvation is available only through our solidarity with the cruci­fied people in our midst. Faith that emerged out of the scandal of the cross is not a faith of intellectuals or elites of any sort. This is the faith of abused and scandalized people -- the losers and the down and out.\n\nLiberal theologians like Niebuhr, Cone, Paul Tillich, and Harvey Cox all wielded significant influence among the modernist, cosmopolitan, and erudite mainline Protestant denominations in opposition to the fundamentalist and anti-intellectual evangelical Protestant denominations. From today's vantage point, it may seem like evangelicals scored an easy cultural victory through sheer attrition. Mainline Protestants had low birth rates and encouraged their children to engage with the broader world, especially by sending their children to college, while evangelicals had higher birth rates and used homeschooling and parallel networks to shut their children off from outside influence. Mainline Protestantism had a focus on racial integration that repelled white segre­gationists, while evangelicals were more willing to overlook segregated communities. Mainline Protestantism's intellectual need to root Chris­tian belief in Enlightenment rationality, sometimes even to the point of viewing God as a metaphor rather than a divine being, alienated more traditionalist Christians. Mainline Protestantism's emphasis on ecumenicism and tolerance led theologically orthodox congregants to evangelicalism and liberal congregants to Unitarian Universalism and atheism, while evangelicalism made it clear that there was only one road to salva­tion. All these factors led to the slow institutional collapse of mainline Protestantism starting in the 1960s, with evangelicalism gradually taking over as the face of American Christianity.\n\nYet the decline of mainline Protestantism did not mean the disappearance of mainline Protestant morality, just as, in Nietzsche's diagno­sis, the decline of Christian belief (the \"death of God\") would not mean the end of Christian-induced morality. As college campuses became packed with the progeny of mainline Protestants, many students began to question their metaphysical belief in God while still retaining their morality. Many such children, along with the non-orthodox Jews who shared the same college campuses, began creating a nontheistic foundation for their morality in the form of critical theory. The result was a new religious movement that drew its converts from the most educated echelons of society and saw itself as based in pure reason, a movement that was later dubbed \"wokeness.\"\n\nThus, in the custody war between American Protestants over who got to define Christian morality, the two branches cut the baby in half: evangelicals got Christian, the mainline got morality.\n\nRight-wing interpretations of Nietzsche were deemed taboo in the dec­ades after the Nazis. In postwar America, the only respectable ways to interpret Nietzsche were either through the Nietzsche-as-existentialist framing pioneered by the émigré Walter Kaufmann, or the \"New Nietzsche\" brought to America by French post-structuralists -- inter­pretations that brushed away or reinterpreted Nietzsche's more reac­tionary thinking. American leftists, as usual, hungered for European minds, looking for a foreign philosopher who could romanticize their cosmopolitan radicalism against what they saw as the \"anti-intellectual­ism in American life,\" the title and central claim of a 1963 Pulitzer-winning book by American academic Richard Hofstadter. The book not only took aim at forces on the American right, such as evangelical Christianity (which, as mentioned earlier, prized revelation over reason) and capitalism (which prized practicality over abstraction), but also criticized the American Left, arguing that the \"cult of proletarianism\" that pervaded socialist movements forced left-wing intellectuals to \"de­class themselves spiritually,\" leading to \"a certain self-depreciation and self-alienation.\" While Hofstadter only mentions Nietzsche in passing, it is not difficult to see how his analysis reflects an appetite among American middle-class intellectuals for a more aristocratic leftism, par­ticularly one with an anti-Christian, anti-democratic, anti-proletarian, and non‑American philoso­pher as its figurehead.\n\nThe Nietzschean post-structuralists became popular in the academy at around the same time that many American Protestants were losing their faith in God, and Nietzsche's attacks on Christianity provided the perfect philosophy for a secularizing generation. Nietzsche's brief aphorism written in a private notebook, \"There are no facts, only interpretations,\" became the cornerstone on which they built their critical theory. Christianity was hegemonic for much of Western society, but there are other grand narratives, so the argument goes, that are just as valid, and because truth is relative, one cannot just accept Christian truth as objective truth. Postmodern was the term used to describe this loss of grand narratives, although many contemporary conservative commentators misconstrue the term as being prescriptive rather than simply an accurate description of the multivariate narratives that spawned following the death of God.\n\nNietzsche's writings on this seeming loss of objective truth and his Emersonian-inflected encouragement of radical individualism, bolstered by new translations of his books by Walter Kaufmann (whose Jewish heritage helped dispel links between Nietzsche and anti-Semitism), re­stored Nietzsche's place as a respectable philosopher. American pragma­tism and Nietzsche's own suspicion of objectivity helped encourage a spirit of anything-goes interpretation, allowing left-wing radicals to drink freely from the well of a philosopher who despised leftism. Nietzsche wasn't the only right-wing philosopher to receive such airbrushing: even though the jurist Carl Schmitt was a literal Nazi at one point, that didn't stop his work from being translated, printed, and analyzed in leftist publications like Telos and the New Left Review decades before Schmitt's name appeared in the work of postliberal Right figures such as Adrian Vermeule.\n\nNietzsche and Schmitt were popular outside the Right in part because they were entertaining. Compared to, say, the snoozefest of John Rawls's monographs, Nietzsche's acerbic prose made leftists feel like free-thinking radicals valiantly dismantling Christian hegemony, and Schmitt's conceptualization of the political as a war between friends and enemies made these academic radicals feel like literal social justice warri­ors.\n\nThe most prominent Nietzschean thinker born from this postmodern milieu was Michel Foucault, whose writings on the connection between power and truth have been used for decades to attack those who posit objective truth, arguing that such claims to objectivity are simply ways for those in power to maintain their oppression of groups without power. Considering that Christianity was still the central moral force in America back in the 1960s and '70s, in an era that Aaron Renn refers to as the \"positive world\" for American Christianity, it made sense for those who wanted to attack the hegemonic morality to attack Christian values, and no philosopher came down harder on Christianity than Nietzsche.\n\nBut that was then; this is now. American Christianity currently exists in a \"negative world\" where, as Renn puts it, \"Being known as a Chris­tian is a social negative, particularly in the elite domains of society. Christian morality is expressly repudiated and seen as a threat to the public good and the new public moral order.\" Such a change in social position has also led to a reversal in the old order of battle in the war of objectivism versus relativism. While interpretations of Foucault's work on power have long been the domain of leftists, Foucault has recently received right-wing reappraisals from Geoff Shullenberger, Blake Smith, and Sohrab Ahmari -- all of whom, unsurprisingly, were former leftists. As Ross Douthat has noted,\n\nThe idea that the left is relativistic belongs to an era when progres­sives were primarily defining themselves against white heteronormative Christian patriarchy, with Foucauldian acid as a solvent for the old regime. Nobody watching today's progressivism at work would call it relativistic: Instead, the goal is increasingly to find new rules, new hierarchies, new moral categories to govern the post-Christian, post-patriarchal, post-cis-het world. . . . Mean­while, conservatives, the emergent regime's designated ene­mies, find themselves drawn to ideas that offer what Shullenberger calls a \"systematic critique of the institutional structures by which modern power operates\" -- even when those ideas belong to their old relativist and postmodernist enemies.\n\nThis meta-example vindicates Foucault's theories on truth. When power was vested in the political Right, right-wingers defended objec­tive truth while their opponents proclaimed relativism. But when power structures changed to favor the Left, progressives began demanding total fealty to their ideology while their opponents became more open to \"alternative facts\" and critiquing the \"liberal lamestream media.\" Truth really does seem tied to power after all.\n\nAnd what of the seemingly contradictory role Christianity plays in this narrative? Nietzsche and early interpreters like Mencken savaged Christianity as the progenitor of leftism, whereas critical theorists characterized Christianity as one of many oppressive right-wing forces, a pillar of \"white heteronormative Christian patriarchy.\" It may seem odd to many practitioners and observers of American Christianity, espe­cially to the white evangelicals who have most politicized the word \"Christian,\" that Nietzsche would claim Christianity is driven by a \"slave morality\" that valorizes meekness and asceticism. The political party that nominally represents American Christianity is the same party that valorizes cutthroat capitalism, boasts of being tough on crime and illegal immigration, mocks \"soy-boys\" and \"hippies\" while celebrating red-meat consumption and AR-15s, and whose de facto leader is an adulterous billionaire who revels in the crude mockery of perceived enemies.\n\nOn the other side, those who seemingly claim to oppose Christian values in favor of moral relativism are in actuality promoting slave morality as objective morality. Postmodernists imagine themselves as moral relativists ready to embrace any number of perspectives. There lurks, however, one objective moral absolute within their allegedly nonobjective framework: the concern for victims. Such a concern is so axiomatic that it is offensive to even suggest otherwise: slave morality, to most living in a \"post-Christian\" society, is just basic morality. Post­modernism thus contains two essential yet contradictory elements: (1) a critique, deconstruction, and ultimately destruction of reason, truth, and metaphysics (the \"death of God\"); and (2) a further entrenchment and affirmation of the Christian \"truth\" of the ethic of concern for victims.\n\nProgressivism is the undisputed reigning ideology of the American academy today, enforcing a Christian-derived ideology of egalitarianism, universalism, and \"scientific\" objectivity while acting like these principles were derived from secular rationalism. On the other hand, American right-wingers are more amenable to \"alternative facts,\" and although nominally Christian, often embrace forms of tribalism and social hierarchy.\n\nThis seeming contradiction in nominal versus practiced Christian morality can be resolved. Over time, Christian morality, especially in its image of the triumph of the oppressed over the oppressor, became so ingrained in the Western psyche that Christian principles acquired axiomatic status. Meanwhile, Christianity also became a symbol of tradition and of Western civilization. Almost everyone was nominally Christian for most of American history. Whether or not they actually believed in Christian metaphysics or its morality, they grounded whatever political views they had on nominally Christian grounds. Then, as detailed in the last section, the side that was more left-wing stopped believing in God, while the side that was more right-wing held more firmly to Christian tradition, thus giving contemporary observers the impression that Christianity is a right-wing bulwark against leftism.\n\nBy separating nominal Christian identification from the Christian concern for victims, there exists four combinations that can be visualized on a two-by-two matrix. The first two positions are woke secular progressivism and right-wing Christian traditionalism or (for American Protestants) evangelicalism, as detailed above. The third position is progressive Christianity, the faith of mainline seminaries and cosmopolitan churches with Progress Pride flags hanging outside. Finally, there is an increasingly popular fourth position: a new right-wing Nietzscheanism.\n\nAs contemporary leftists no longer find much use in moral relativism, left-wing Nietzscheanism has faded into the twentieth century, and as the Nazi associations of right-wing Nietzscheanism have eroded with time, the latter has experienced a recent resurgence. No thinker has pushed Nietzsche more forcefully into the contemporary political con­sciousness than the political philosopher and online personality Costin Alamariu, who expounds a version of right-wing Nietzschean thought for online audiences as Mencken once did for readers of the Baltimore Sun.\n\nAlamariu, by his own account, first became enamored with Nietzsche at age sixteen, and unlike the other teenage Nietzscheans at his suburban Massachusetts high school, he has remained faithful to Nie­tzsche throughout his adult life, later writing his Yale doctoral dissertation on \"The Problem of Tyranny and Philosophy in the Thought of Plato and Nietzsche.\" After rising to niche internet fame on \"Frog­twitter,\" an anonymous constellation of alt-right social media personalities, Alamariu came to greater prominence in 2018 with a tract titled Bronze Age Mindset (hereafter, BAM), published under the pseudonym Bronze Age Pervert. At less than two hundred pages long and split into seventy-seven Nietzschean-style aphoristic chapters filled with edgy pidgin-like prose, BAM spans a grab bag of topics ranging from ancient Greek history to the psychology of homosexuality (a \"gay science,\" if you will) to complaints of there being too many Mormons in the CIA. At several points in the book, Alamariu informs the reader that Nie­tzsche had previously made many of Alamariu's own observations, and he updates Nietzsche's \"Last Man\" to what he calls the \"bugman\" -- a muliebral figure who lives for nothing but mindless consumption and who promotes leftist politics out of deep envy for the strong and beautiful.\n\nTo avoid the bugman trap, Alamariu exhorts disaffected young men to revive ancient Greek modes of male friendship and to go on swashbuckling journeys as modern-day pirates. BAM has gained a cult follow­ing, with Michael Anton writing a glowing review in the Claremont Review of Books declaring that, among disaffected right-wing American youth, Buckleyism is losing while BAPism is winning. Tired of the not‑so-beautiful losers of \"Conservatism Inc.,\" who BAPists claim only capitulate to the Left while pretending to push back, these new Nie­tzscheans want to overthrow the current political system in favor of a Caesar who can clean up \"trashworld\" for good.\n\nIn contrast to his idol Nietzsche, who centered Christianity and its historical impact in his writing, Alamariu pays relatively little attention to Christian history and theology. Rather than finding leftism's fons et origo in Christianity, as Nietzsche does, Alamariu traces the origin of such morality to the \"longhouse,\" a metonym for the risk-averse and egalitarian matriarchal societies that supposedly existed before the advent of civilization, whose norms have returned through modern feminism. Men once conquered cities and put them to the sword and fire, so the narrative goes. But in our sclerotic modern age, would-be warriors and aristocrats of the soul have been \"longhoused,\" their vitality drained by girlfriends who drag them to wine bars.\n\nWhile BAM readily demeans Jews, Muslims, and Mormons, Ala­mariu writes of Christianity that \"Offending Christians in political movements is stupid, when they're one of the last bastions against a common enemy.\" The only time he invokes Christianity negatively is a comment about how modern-day leftists are not relativistic but are rather like \"Presbyterian schoolmarms.\" Perhaps the longhouse concept itself is a Straussian maneuver: the longhouse serves as the unifying scapegoat that forges an alliance of right-wing Christians and Nietzscheans, as Christians would otherwise be offended by heavy-handed criti­cism of Christianity.\n\nIn Alamariu's dissertation, however, recently republished with an added foreword under the title Selective Breeding and the Birth of Philosophy, there is no mention of the longhouse, apart from a solitary quip about \"gyno-gerontocratic democracy.\" Here, Alamariu does pro­mote Nietzsche's criticisms of Christianity, especially Nietzsche's claim that Christianity is Platonism for the masses. In his new introduction, Alamariu argues that the Christian ban on cousin marriage genetically altered European people to be prone to egalitarian and universalist ideologies, a theory that recently gained mainstream traction (albeit with the opposite spin) when it was advanced in anthropologist Joseph Henrich's book The WEIRDest People in the World: How the West Became Psychologically Peculiar and Particularly Prosperous (2020).\n\nAlamariu's ambivalent treatment of Christianity seems to reflect its peculiar status, and contradictory political valences, in America today. Alamariu is probably the first American interpreter of Nietzsche to grapple with his critique of \"slave morality\" in the time of \"negative world\" Christianity: the establishment enforcers of this morality are avowedly anti-Christian, while self-professed Christians see themselves as part of a right-wing rebellion against it.\n\nIndeed, BAPism, despite all its paeans to ancient Greece, retains a distinctively American ethos, even beyond its earnest participation in contemporary partisan politics. Part of this is due to Alamariu's Strauss­ian intellectual heritage. Leo Strauss, a refugee from Nazi Germany and émigré to the United States, lent European intellectual prestige to de­fenses of the American \"regime\" and became one of the most influential thinkers of Cold War-era American conservatism. At a time when left-Nietzschean moral relativism was gaining steam in academia, Strauss's philosophy (which in many aspects drew from Nietzsche as well) offered American conservatives an intellectual defense of \"natural right.\" Strauss's interpretation of ancient Greek philosophy as a counter to modern post-Enlightenment philosophy, particularly German existentialism, gave readers a chance to Americanize the \"wisdom of the ancients,\" especially with regard to the American founding. America, in this narrative -- later given popular expression by Straussians such as Allan Bloom and Francis Fukuyama -- was the bearer and protector of Western civilization, fending off intellectual critics, political enemies, and dangerous philosophical mutations from abroad. It is telling that after Strauss's death, his students split themselves into two camps named not by specific ideologies or people, but by American geographic loca­tions. With the exception of China, where philosophy professor Liu Xiaofeng has nearly single-handedly popularized Strauss to a Chinese audience, Straussianism has mainly been an American endeavor.\n\nAlamariu, too, has an immigrant background. He came to America from Romania at age ten, so he still retained memories of the old country as he attempted to assimilate into his new one. Alamariu didn't fit neatly into the literal black-and-white American racial schema, as he is Balkan and Ashkenazi Jewish, and thus may have had trouble assimi­lating into a coherent identity, and like many other teens with identity crises, he turned to Nietzsche.\n\nJulius Krein has hinted at the possibility that some of Strauss's (and thus also Alamariu's) philosophical contours can be analyzed through the work of John Murray Cuddihy, a sociologist known for his mono­graphs on American Jewish culture and American civil religion. Cuddihy argues that the nineteenth-century project of Jewish emancipation, which allowed European Jews to leave their ghettos and join Western society, resulted in an \"ordeal of civility,\" in which Jews had to give up their Yiddishkeit (their \"Jewishness\") in order to adopt what Cuddihy called the \"Protestant Esthetic and Etiquette,\" to be \"civi­lized\" into the Western liberal world. What made the ordeal difficult, though, was that Jewish intellectuals who went through this process experienced shame for rejecting the \"vulgar\" Yiddishkeit of their ances­tors. Cuddihy spends much of The Ordeal of Civility arguing that many of the ideas proposed by Jewish intellectuals like Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx, and Claude Lévi-Strauss were attempts to establish as universals what were originally mere expressions of Yiddishkeit.\n\nCuddihy's book contains an epigraph from the Jewish \"New York intellectual\" Lionel Trilling: \"The German Jews . . . were likely to be envied and resented by East European Jews for what would have been called their refinement.\" Cuddihy discusses at length Eastern Euro­pean Jews in particular, especially in his \"tale of two Hoffmans\" of the Chicago Seven trial, examining the difference between the assimilated judge Julius Hoffman, who maintains Protestant civility, versus the vulgar Ostjude Abbie Hoffman, who disrupted civil society in attempting to start a riot at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.\n\nViewed through a Cuddihian lens, Strauss can be seen as the civilized German Jewish émigré, the respectable University of Chicago professor who represents a successful product of Jewish emancipation into the secularized Protestantism of Western modernity (at least outwardly as a \"friend\" of America's liberal regime). Alamariu, meanwhile, plays (note that he plays the part, channeled through his BAP persona, rather than is in actuality) the vulgar Ostjude who rejects modernity, writing in pidgin‑like prose and hosting an iconoclastic podcast in which he talks with a thick Romanian accent.\n\nHence the different attitudes Strauss and Alamariu display toward Nietzsche. Whereas the respectable Strauss often portrays Nietzsche as a dangerous and misguided thinker, as a promoter of moral relativism against natural right, Alamariu plays the vulgar, unassimilated Jew who idolizes Nietzsche -- the ultimate critic of Christianity and modernity -- while railing against assimilation into the Western secularized-Protestant civil religion. Similarly, one can frame Alamariu's squabbles with his dissertation adviser Steven B. Smith -- a Straussian who previously wrote a book arguing that liberalism's origins can be found in Jewish thought -- as a dispute between the assimilated Jew and the Ostjude over the latter's explicit rejection of secular Protestant civility, with Alamariu playing Abbie Hoffman to Smith's Julius Hoffman. Indeed, Smith told the journalist Graeme Wood, \"I was shocked that his family would escape Ceaușescu's Romania only for Costin to undermine the principles of [American] democracy.\"\n\nFrom one angle, then, Alamariu can be seen as the leader of a terrifying movement of pagan vitalist bodybuilders ready to release lions from zoos and overthrow bugman society. But from another angle, Alamariu conforms perfectly to the trite trope of an Eastern European Jew who moves to a Western liberal democracy and refuses to melt into the secularized Protestant pot, eventually inventing an entire ideology to universalize a particular cultural expression. Such a story -- the immigrant Kulturkampf between the pressure of assimilating to a new society while perhaps still feeling nostalgia toward the old one -- is a quintessential narrative of this \"nation of immigrants.\"\n\nTo be sure, Cuddihy's work could be dismissed as ungrounded psychological speculation, and a few early reviewers felt that the book played to anti-Semitic canards and relied too much on post hoc rational­izations. But it is notable that Alamariu himself has endorsed Cuddihy's thesis. In episode 27 of his podcast Carribean Rhythms, Alamariu sum­marizes and endorses The Ordeal of Civility. So whether or not Cuddi­hy's central thesis is true, it appears that Alamariu believes it is, and Alamariu's participation in online anti-Semitic right-wing spaces, despite his Jewish background, may have created a Kulturkampf in which BAPism emerged, retconning the provincial shtetl mindset into a more universal \"Bronze Age\" one. Such a tale of democratic self-making -- in which an immigrant Eastern European Jew, a character long denigrated by right-wingers as a subverter of Western civilization, could rise to become a leading figure within those anti-immigrant and anti-Semitic circles -- could happen, one is tempted to say, \"only in America.\"\n\nSo what has been the impact of Alamariu's Nietzschean exhortations? Perhaps true BAPists are too busy living lives of sun and steel to be shackled to smartphones and social media, because the anonymous online \"vitalists\" extolling BAPism don't seem especially vital. Nietzsche famously attacked Christianity for bringing Platonism's split-world metaphysics to the masses, giving people hope in a utopian world outside the physical one, much like how terminally online BAPists are giving up real-world success in exchange for a parallel online world where \"likes\" and \"follows\" serve as artificial status (\"copes,\" in internet parlance) and ressentiment-fueled mob mentality is actively encouraged. It still remains to be seen if Alamariu's online success can translate to the physical world.\n\nWhile contemporary right-wing Nietzscheans typically side with Dionysus, there are a few who extol the Crucified. One predicted the potential and perils of online politics early on. The tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel, who was an early investor in Facebook after seeing its potential to harness human desire, has generated controversy over the years for his promotion of antidemocratic right-wing politics.\n\nThiel noted in a speech at a New Criterion gala in 2023 that there are two schools of Nietzschean thought operating on the American right. One \"boils down to a strong-man argument -- think of Bronze Age Pervert and other internet types -- that says, well, the West may in fact be chauvinist, racist, sexist, and all the other things it's accused of being, but we should embrace that rather than apologize for it.\" The other, Thiel hints, lies in a statement made by Nietzsche at the end of his life declaring that the \"God of the Jews\" had won -- that the concern for victims brought about by Christianity has become the de facto concern of the West, so instead of trying to undo this transvaluation of values, a return to Christianity may be key to saving Western civilization.\n\nThiel himself identifies as a Christian while also acknowledging that wokeness is a sort of \"ultra-Christianity.\" In the same New Criterion speech, he argues that \"The so-called woke religion is a perversion of this Judeo-Christian tradition . . . they are so closely related that we might call wokeness a particularly Christian temptation.\" Thiel here is borrowing from his mentor back when he was an undergraduate at Stanford, the late Catholic anthropologist René Girard, who wrote that\n\nWhat only the great insight of a Nietzsche could formerly perceive, now even a child can perceive. . . . The fact that our world has become solidly anti-Christian, at least among its elites, does not prevent the concern for victims from flourishing -- just the opposite. The majestic inauguration of the \"post-Christian era\" is a joke. We are living through a caricatural \"ultra-Christianity\" that tries to es­cape from the Judeo-Christian orbit by \"radicalizing\" the concern for victims in an anti-Christian manner.\n\nThiel has made the promotion of Girard's work central to his political ambitions over the past two decades, constantly name-dropping Girard in various speeches and essays, starting a think tank dedicated to Girard's work, and passing Girard's theories down to his own acolytes, most notably to JD Vance, who cites Girard's theories as a major impe­tus for his own conversion to Catholicism. Girard, in turn, considered Nietzsche to be the primary inspiration for his own theories on the centrality of Christianity in human history.\n\nGirard's historical account of religion goes as follows: Human desire is fundamentally mimetic; humans want what other humans want. Such desires lead to mimetic rivalry since two people cannot possess the same object. Mimetic rivalry thus increases among a society, threatening the society's cohesion. Human societies found a way to stop this ever-increasing rivalry through blaming all their problems on a scapegoat and killing it, allowing a society to unleash its pent-up mimetic rivalry and restore peace. The societal peace that the scapegoat brought paradoxically made society worship it as a god: the sacrificed deity that stopped mimetic rivalry from destroying the community. Thus, it is the violence of the sacrifice that creates the sacred (note the shared etymology of sacred and sacrifice), which is ritualized into religion. And while Christi­anity appears to have begun the same way, there is one crucial difference: Christ, the victim, is fully innocent, while Christ's victimizers are complicit in the literal death of God, thus exposing the scapegoat mechanism as a folly and forcing the victimizers to look inward rather than finding an outsider to blame. Christ's teachings of turning the other cheek also end the cycle of mimetic rivalry, as violence is reciprocated not with revenge, but with peace, thus also mimetically imbuing the victimizers with a desire for peace.\n\nIt is almost trite these days to say that wokeness is like Christianity without forgiveness. Yet this statement makes perfect sense in a Girard­ian framework: wokeness retains the slave morality of Christianity without Christ to expose and prevent the scapegoat mechanism. There is no mechanism in place for forgiving transgressions, so the cycle of violence repeats endlessly as woke adherents compile an ever-expanding list of transgressions to justify tearing down more statues and engaging in more struggle sessions. Girard draws extensively from Nietzsche throughout his works, arguing that it was Nietzsche who first glimpsed the violent scapegoat mechanism and recognized the special case of the innocent Christ as the transvaluation of values that it was. But while Nietzsche saw the death of God as a foregone conclusion, providing readers with a new model of human flourishing in the Übermensch (whose greatest act, it should be noted, is overcoming the desire for revenge, particularly revenge against time), Girard and his adherents still see the possibility of a mass conversion to Christianity that will stop runaway mimetic rivalry from bringing about an apocalyptic world.\n\nGirard thus provides a neo-Chestertonian apologia for Christianity: if man does not believe in God, he will believe in anything, so it is best that society all believes in God to avoid the uncertainty of the \"any­thing.\" And while most anthropologists working under liberal principles are wont to view Christianity as just another religion in a pluralistic society, Girard's framework posits Christianity as primus inter pares, the only religion able to stop the cycle of scapegoating. Meanwhile, as Girard points out, contemporary atheists believe that society has no need for God while still clinging to the morality created by Christianity. Nietzsche was the one who pointed out this contradiction and simply took it to its logical conclusion.\n\nWhen Thiel became an early investor in Facebook, he had the prescience to realize that the new frontiers opened by social media would completely reshape human life. And it has been Thiel's promotion of Girard that has mimetically led to the widespread adoption of Girard's theories by right-wing Silicon Valley elites.\n\nIt's worth noting how strange it is that the actual impact of Girardian thought has largely been siloed to a uniquely American institution: Silicon Valley. There could just as easily be a coherent left-Girardianism, especially considering that Girard views the Nietzschean critique of Christianity's impact as a validation, echoing Reinhold Niebuhr before him. In fact, Girard's magnum opus I See Satan Fall Like Lightning was published not by a conservative or right-wing press but rather by Orbis Books, a left-wing Catholic publisher best known for publishing Latin American liberation theology and other Marxist-inspired works.\n\nIt is a testament to the culture of Silicon Valley, and to the pragmatic and entrepreneurial spirit of America itself, that ideas originally intend­ed as Christian apologia are instead more likely to be read in VC-backed start-ups. Thiel's bestselling Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future (2014) and start-up guru Luke Burgis's Wanting: The Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life (2021) both secularize Girard's ideas into business tips. Girard's theories on scapegoating and mimetic desire are now used by Silicon Valley software engineers not as Christian hermeneutical tools but rather for the creation of social media algorithms that maximize user engagement and sales. The contemplative spiritual core of Girard's work turned out to be no match for the entrepreneurial and pragmatic spirit of the land that produced Edward Bernays. The idea that Christian principles can and should make one rich, not just spiritually but also in the form of cold, hard cash, is as American an ethos as it gets, conjuring up images of \"Prosperity Gos­pel\" televangelists with private jets promising their audiences that God wants them to become millionaires.\n\nThus, it is perhaps not a surprise that among today's right-wing American Nietzscheans, it seems possible for a marriage of convenience: instead of positing a Manichaean struggle between Dionysus and the Crucified, they view the two as (to borrow a term from Christology) consubstantial. Thiel mentioned during a conference on Girard that he preferred the Christianity of Constantine over the Christianity of Mother Theresa. Similarly, Alamariu praises the actions of Christian conquistadors in BAM. And First Things, the flagship journal of the American Christian Right, published an explainer on the longhouse concept written by a friend of Alamariu.\n\nIn Nietzsche's notes, later published by his sister under the title The Will to Power, he muses of an Übermensch that is a \"Caesar with Christ's soul.\" Perhaps, then, the seemingly contradictory concept of \"Christianity with Nietzschean characteristics\" -- or vice versa -- is not as far-fetched as one may imagine it to be.\n\nAll these interpretations of Nietzsche -- from the anti-Christian and antidemocratic jottings of radicals in America's Progressive Era, to the praise of liberal Christian theologians against evangelical fundamentalists, to the anti-proletarian leftists allegedly promoting moral relativism, to the online \"vitalists\" fantasizing about toppling the government, to the Silicon Valley Girardians with their plans for digitally harnessing mimetic desire, and countless others -- show the sheer versatility and breadth of Nietzschean thought in America.\n\nFrom one angle, the eternal recurrence of Nietzschean thought in this nation of immigrants suggests a cultural stagnancy shaped by the unique American intellectual scene (or lack thereof): the never-ending subservience to European \"courtly muses\" as arbiters of high culture. The American individualistic spirit paradoxically creates affinities for what is not American, an \"ancient-shaped hole\" that leads Americans to come up with their own convoluted histories connecting America back to a society that actually had ancients (as in the \"retvrn\" role-playing on the right). Meanwhile, the Silicon Valley cult of technology promises maximal individualism but has only ended up harnessing mimetic desire for profit, and whose smartphones have led to a societal flattening, the impact of which requires a dozen more Byung-Chul Han tracts to fully comprehend.\n\nFrom another angle, however, Nietzsche's continued presence and resonance in America suggests that he never forgot his Emersonian inheritance. Although Nietzsche's self-creating individuals and free spirits take their bearings from man's deepest spiritual yearnings and conflicts -- rather than the shallow self-interest of anglophone classical liberalism -- his characters are immediately and perpetually recognizable to American democrats, pragmatists, and entrepreneurs. Nietzsche's followers in America, therefore, always seem at once the country's most vehement critics and quintessentially American types. Indeed, Nietzsche might well be understood as a temporarily embarrassed American. Übermensch, after all, can be translated as Superman -- and what's more American than the story of an identity-changing reporter and caped superhero invented by the assimilated sons of Jewish immigrants?\n\nNietzsche spoke little of America itself, but, seemingly channeling Tocqueville before him, he described \"that American faith of today\" as one \"where the individual is convinced of being able to do just about anything, of being capable of just about any role, where each person experiments with himself, improvises, experiments anew, experiments joyfully; where all nature ceases and becomes art.\" And that is exactly what the pragmatic American spirit has done, not least in interpreting Nietzsche himself.\n\nMore than a century after Nietzsche's death, his writings still exist in a state of eternal recurrence, his clarion calls ready to be heeded by generation upon generation of disaffected Americans. Nietzsche gave up his Prussian citizenship in 1869, wandering around stateless the rest of his life. Perhaps if he had sailed across the Atlantic to the land of his childhood hero, Emerson, he might have found that America was his true home.\n\nIn Nietzsche's magnum opus Thus Spoke Zarathustra, the protagonist Zarathustra is led by two friendly animals: an eagle with a snake coiled around its neck. While Nietzsche was almost certainly not think­ing about the United States in deploying these symbols, it is well within the power of American pragmatism to interpret this imagery -- and Nietzsche himself -- as deeply American. The wise snake represents the unity and defiance of the American people, with its call to \"join, or die\" and its warning of \"don't tread on me.\" The proud eagle, soaring across the skies, represents America's strength and independent spirit. The two intertwined animals guide Zarathustra's path, as he climbs down from his mountaintop cave and toward the city upon a hill."

        "content": "Adolescence is the period of biological, psychological, sexual and social development in human life that immediately follows childhood and precedes youth. It is difficult to define an exact age range for this critical period of maturational transition, and although the World Health Organization defines this period as between 10 and 19 years (UNICEF. 2021), it varies according to region, culture or the educational system in place.\n\nReligion plays an important role in human social relations. The set of beliefs or dogmas about divinity, moral norms for individual and social conduct and ritual practices influence interpersonal and social relations.\n\nTherefore, it may be useful to explore adolescents' religious beliefs and values, taking into account their family relationships, social support networks and relationships in schools and in their communities in general (Rymarz and Graham. 2006).\n\nReligion/spirituality in adolescents is also often considered a protective factor in the area of health (Cotton et al. 2006). Of interest are the experiences and learning processes of adolescents' religious education taking into account different learning environments such as the family, places of worship, at school and on the Internet (Mehmet, Kolb and Sejdini 2023).\n\nUnderstanding the influence of religion on people during this period of the human maturation process is undoubtedly an interesting area of research, since points such as religious practice or the human values that underlie the observance of religious doctrine in adolescents are areas of study that are seldom dealt with.\n\nAll this can promote peaceful development through education through knowledge, self-reflection and dialogue as pedagogical tools (Benjamin et al. 2022).\n\nThe integration of the religious fact within the maturational stage of adolescence and the relationship that adolescents have with religion, the influence of religious experiences in this context of change and the learning of religion during adolescence, whether in a formal or informal context, may be interesting research topics to investigate and share results for in this Special Issue.\n\nThis Special Issue aims to:\n\n- Study the relationship that adolescents maintain with religion.\n\n- Investigate the role of religion in the maturation process of adolescents.\n\n- Find out about the formal and informal teaching of religion given to adolescents in the different educational systems.\n\n- Investigate the influence of different educational systems on adolescents' conception of religion.\n\n- Understand the human values underlying the observance of religious doctrine in adolescents.\n\n- Deepen our knowledge of the religious practices of adolescents.\n\n- Share any scientific point of view that can illuminate the knowledge of the religious development of adolescents.\n\nIn this Special Issue, original research articles and reviews are welcome. Research areas may include (but are not limited to) the following:\n\nWe look forward to receiving your contributions.\n\nReference:\n\nManuscripts should be submitted online at www.mdpi.com by registering and logging in to this website.

        "content": "Journalists examined different factors that shaped the 2024 presidential election, focusing on how religious values and communities influenced the results and what they mean for a divided United States, during a Nov. 12 webinar.\n\nThe discussion, hosted by Georgetown University's Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life -- which promotes dialogue on Catholic social thought as well as national and global issues -- was part of the Initiative's \"Faith and the Faithful\" series, which began in 2014 to address the role of faith in U.S. politics and policy. In the 2024 presidential election on Nov. 5, former president Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, won both the popular vote and Electoral College, defeating Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nJohn Carr, who moderated the panel and is the founder of the Initiative, opened the discussion by stressing the importance of religion as a factor in national politics.\n\n\"What we don't know and haven't talked about much is how religious values and voters shape that outcome, and how the appeals of candidates and parties to people's values and deepest convictions made a difference,\" Carr said at the event. \"Oftentimes, the role of religion, the role of values, is neglected or oversimplified.\"\n\nJudy Woodruff, a senior correspondent of PBS NewsHour whose series \"America at a Crossroads\" explores the effect of political divisions in the U.S., said the economy was a major factor in the election.\n\n\"I think it became pretty clear early on that people were frustrated with the current administration in a number of ways, but principally around the economy,\" Woodruff said at the event. \"While COVID has receded into the background, people still remember a lot of what happened there.\"\n\nSabrina Rodriguez, a national politics reporter for The Washington Post, added that voters ultimately prioritized economic concerns over other issues.\n\n\"What Democrats were betting on in part was that people would look at Donald Trump, the person, and not be willing to vote for him, that because of his personality, the rhetoric he uses, some of the more far right policies or perspectives he's embraced, that people would be alarmed,\" Rodriguez said at the event. \"Ultimately, it didn't matter in the face of people feeling tremendous economic anxiety.\"\n\nRyan Burge, a journalist and data analyst on religion and politics, said the religious and political makeup of the U.S. posed issues for the Democratic party.\n\n\"The Democrats have this huge problem -- their coalition is this weird mishmash of atheists, but also Black Protestants, also Hispanic Catholics, also Muslims,\" Burge said at the event.\n\nBurge added that the shift in support toward Trump among Hispanic voters, a highly Catholic population, contributed to the election results.\n\n\"We're seeing Hispanics move significantly to the right, and I think part of that is the Democratic Party has sort of taken them for granted, on cultural issues, on faith issues,\" Burge said. \"I think the Harris campaign, by leaning so hard into the 'we're going to bring Roe v. Wade back,' and not talking about carve-outs for religious institutions, and not even really talking about religious institutions in a meaningful way, kind of pushed a lot of Hispanic Catholics away from the Democratic Party when they would have voted for them.\"\n\nWoodruff said bridging divisions in U.S. politics requires acknowledging the various circumstances that shape voting choices, rather than simply attributing them to character flaws.\n\n\"Bridging groups are out there trying to get people just to sit over a cup of coffee or over a beer, have a conversation and understand that somebody's coming from a different place, but that doesn't make them evil, it doesn't make them a bad or dishonest or terrible person,\" Woodruff said. \"And yet, right now, most Republicans say they think most Democrats are dishonest, and vice versa, immoral.\"\n\n\"That's really sad, in my opinion, but that's where we are and we've got a lot of work to do just to get to a place where we stop and are willing to entertain the idea that somebody could disagree with us politically, but that doesn't make them a terrible person,\" Woodruff added."

One of her goals, she said, was to serve as a bridge between Black and South Asian communities.\n\nShe added that she has a deep respect for Hinduism, and said learning about the religion has strengthened her Christian faith.\n\n\"What I was trying to express was the fact that I would really love to see a lot more unity around Canada,\" she said. \"And I think, obviously, I sadly did not get to communicate that as well as I would have wanted to.\"\n\nIn a statement issued Friday, Vancouver Police Board chair Frank Chong said recent statements posted to social media by Sakoma-Fadugba \"do not reflect the values of the board and are inconsistent with our code of conduct.\"\n\nThe Vancouver Police Board governance manual has a section in which the board says one of its guiding values is to do work in a manner that recognizes and values diversity.\n\n\"Internally, we create an environment that is free of discrimination, we respect diversity, create equitable systems and processes, and build an inclusive workplace culture,\" the manual reads.\n\nGarry Begg, B.C.'s solicitor general and minister of public safety, said in a statement that the comments \"spread hate and division amongst communities and they will not be tolerated.\"\n\nVancouver Mayor Ken Sim said the views shared by Sakoma-Fadugba don't reflect his beliefs nor the policies of the City of Vancouver or police board.\n\n\"As public leaders, it's our responsibility to bring people together and focus on what unites us, not what divides us,\" Sim said in a statement.\n\nElenore Sturko, the B.C. Conservative MLA for South Surrey and a former RCMP officer, said she thought it was appropriate for the board to accept Sakoma-Fadugba's resignation, adding that her comments were offensive, particularly to the transgender community.\n\n\"It comes down to trust,\" Sturko said.\n\n\"When we have statements being made that erode the public's trust, or their comfort with their police service, it makes it that much harder on the frontline officers.\""

        "source": "AMAC - The Association of Mature American Citizens",
        "content": "America, since its inception, has been a place of opportunity for aspiring, high-skilled people. The geniuses and artisans of Europe of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries flooded to these shores, enriching the society in many cases and making invaluable contributions to American culture - from our culinary traditions to newfound architectural styles - that continue to be influential through the present day. This custom of selecting only the best and brightest is not anomalous to great nations throughout history. All nations are only as good as the people which compose them: thus, any worthwhile nation would desire to enhance the quality of its people overall in order to elevate its global standing.\n\nThat operative goal, however, cannot be achieved under the present, suicidal policy of citizenship by birthright. Among nations of the world, America is the only developed one that confers citizenship onto anyone simply for having been born to a parent who managed to inhabit these borders, regardless of legality. That America is the only noteworthy country to still have this policy in place should be enough evidence alone of its insanity. The prevailing view among liberal legal scholars is that the Fourteenth Amendment sanctions this policy, which is permanent and cannot be altered. This is flatly wrong. This erroneous interpretation is the byproduct of a slipshod and lazy construction of that particular Amendment, through the prism of erroneous interpretations of largely discredited, or at least, increasingly obsolete legal precedent.\n\nRenowned and constitutional experts - from yours truly, to John Eastman, to Mike Anton, to countless others, have delved into these issues at great length elsewhere, all worthwhile reads that make compelling cases for the alternative (and frankly, common sense) view that not only does the Fourteenth Amendment not, by letter or spirit, authorize citizenship by birthright - its Framers would have actively objected to the pernicious interpretation favored by so many leftist academicians today, basically calling unconstitutional any policy that places any limits whatsoever on citizenship.\n\nInstead, the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment -- alongside the framers of the original Constitution -- would be in lockstep with President Donald Trump's view, that birthright citizenship is wrong, legally and morally -- and that a change to current law is in order. That citizenship should be a privilege and not a right that is automatically given has compelling arguments independent of the broader legal and constitutional considerations that couch its moral framing in the popular discourse, which, although important, ultimately run downstream of the inherent common sense and undeniable logic for why such a policy is bad for any nation. These arguments may be divided into two categories: 1) logistical or \"practical\" reasons for why citizenship should not be conferred simply for having been born on these shores; and 2) deeper political reasons, dealing in national pride, patriotism, and self-identity, for why a policy of unmitigated birthright citizenship, especially today, will lead any society - the United States above all - down the pathway to inevitable decay.\n\nOn the first category, logistically it is easy - even intuitive - to divine why citizenship cannot be granted automatically simply because a particular individual was born on U.S. soil. The first deals with the magnitude of the present immigration crisis, whereby at least 15-20 million illegal aliens (and by other estimates, tens of millions more, potentially upwards of 50+ million) currently reside in the homeland, unchecked and without penalty. It may not be politically correct to say, but a significant portion of these illegals - far more than what legacy media would have you believe - harbor criminal records, and not simply crimes for having trespassed into the interior. A growing share of this lot of illegals are linked to drug and sex-trafficking cartels. On this score, it is obvious why they should not be here. However, once these criminals have children, they weaponize them like pawns to further exploit our reckless immigration policy as emotional leverage to remain in the United States with impunity, continuing their destructive enterprises.\n\nIt is easy to create a sob story of a young child who might not know any other country as his home: but that narrative is both oversimplistic - in not telling the dark money side of the story - as well as nefarious - to both child and nation alike. The current immigration structure incentivizes dangerous criminals to have children who they otherwise would not have - at least in the United States - to extend their stays, sometimes indefinitely, while domiciled in the homeland. The poster child for continuing a policy of birthright citizenship then masquerades those who create narratives, like Democrat-funded NGOs such as Catholic Charities, which then have financial incentives to keep the exploitation ruse going. It is almost always true that the most vocal mouthpieces for perpetuating our insane open borders policies are economically linked to drug or child sex trafficking money, and thus have massive reason to adopt their position in the first place.\n\nAs for the nation writ large, the negative externalities are too many to count: continuing the narcotics trade results in a weaker population overall, higher rates of unproductivity and avoidable accidents, and inevitably, a higher number of premature deaths, especially among the youth. Precious resources are now being used to fight off drug dealers and cartels - and treat the afflicted in hospitals - that could otherwise be more used on societally-enhancing spending efforts like better schooling, infrastructure, and other national renewal projects if the former problems did not exist. The dangerous homes in which the children of traffickers are raised is no place to form productive citizens equipped with the virtues of being a law-abiding and value-enhancing individual to society. In so many of these communities, English is but an afterthought. Assimilation projects are nonexistent: the Left, which actively profits off such policies, demonizes any attempt at assimilation - including every attempt to inculcate foreigners or children of foreigners with American values, the baseline of which should include proficiency in the English language, respect for the rule of law, and at least a rudimentary understanding of our history and Constitution. Without these cultural unifiers, Americans become more alienated and differentiated in ways that breed distrust among peoples and discontent for institutions, yielding a much more fractured and polarized society overall.\n\nNo nation can stand on its own terms as a mere economic zone: one that is culturally relativistic and cosmopolitan in the worst ways possible: a hodgepodge of amorphous identities and alien practices, not even bound by a common language in pursuit of E pluribus unum. As a matter of practice, that recipe always spells doom. It leads to systematic economic gridlock and bottlenecks in institutions ranging from mass transit to education to healthcare (think of the delays and high propensity for error of a physician or nursing staff with an insufficient grasp of the English language). With a greater share of the population not knowing English, it additionally means far fewer people have any handle of our Constitution - and the fundamental principles it lays out like due process and free speech rights - a document that is, after all, written in and to be interpreted by \"English speaking peoples.\"\n\nThese aforementioned practical concerns of persisting in the current policy, of which only a sampling was outlined, flow downstream of more fundamental issues concerning civic identity and national self-conception. Any confident organization, sure of its constitution and purpose, will orient around a basic set of principles or standards that articulate a series of best practices. What these best practices really amounts to is a value system that comprise the organization's greater cultural identity and sense of purpose. For a business, that might mean having a college degree and appearing to work on time and in person every day. Analogously, for a nation, those common or unifying values are what binds (and creates) a People - providing the lifeblood of a civic religion that keeps the nationhood vehicle humming along one generation after another. America's civic religion, so to speak, has been one of ordered liberty and self-governance. These are the component parts of We the People. These general principles derive from both Anglo-American law - whose highest expression in the American civil context is the Constitution and Declaration of Independence - and Christian ethics, a robust and lived expression for which every Founding Father (and generations of statesmen thereafter) believed no country that hoped to remain free could live without.\n\nAccordingly, no self-respecting country steeped in these principles would allow simply anyone to cross over the southern border and become a citizen by default. America's political culture of self-governance requires hard discipline and self-sacrifice. These are virtues that are cultivated over time in a people, and only passed down through the generations by a determined and concerted effort. If it were so easy, a matter of mere happenstance, then all the blood and political turmoil that was a tragic but necessary component of the American Revolution and Civil War would have been in vain. Similarly, all the bloodshed in wars America fought throughout its history would be for naught. The idea of American exceptionalism - evocative of the romantic, classic image of a \"City upon a Hill\" - taps into this notion of uniqueness. The United States of America is exceptional because it is unlike anything seen in history; furthermore, it has no contemporary equivalent, even in modern times. Exceptionalism by definition means something that is exclusive.\n\nThe exclusivity of the \"American Experiment\" is not something that happens accidentally, it's a cultural sensibility inculcated in a particular People, whose values have been passed down generation by generation. That throughout history that People happened to be overwhelmingly European - or a majority English-speaking in Christian is not a mere afterthought or footnote. This and other facts are the lifeblood of America's civic religion; they cannot be swept aside willy-nilly by virtue of their inconvenience or \"problematic value\" within the moral framing of twenty first century wokeism. Of course, judging by that standard, virtually all Western History would be deemed \"problematic.\" But the issue with that reasoning (aside from its reliance on a reductive and simply idiotic system of secular morality) is that it is our history which is responsible for who we are today. To indict all of history, as the modern progressive would, as antiquarian or in scathingly critical terms: which is to say, only ever, negatively, as a standard of judging what not to do - then all the things responsible for making us who we are today for the better must also be dispensed with. That includes the moral framework or values of the past - including the sacrifice, discipline, resilience, and honor - that flowered the policies which led to America being able to cultivate an extraordinary People who in turn produced the freest society ever seen in the modern world. This of course would be an unmitigated disaster for any developed country, but a pluralistic one like the United States, would make it catastrophic.\n\nIn many ways, our modern decadence - the fruits of the toils and labors of the collective past - has ironically clouded our vision to the harsher truths needed to produce and sustain the sort of country we so readily take for granted today (and which, because of that forgetting, is rapidly dissipating before our very eyes). These sterner facts ultimately turn on the deeper or \"political\" reasons, referenced earlier, that explain why no serious country would ever take so cavalierly a policy, much as the United States does, of automatic birthright citizenship. If any person in the world can become a citizen for being born on U.S. soil de facto, it undermines faith in the entire system of values - including the sacrifices, discipline, and hard work - necessary for producing ordered liberty, the cornerstone of America's civic religion, to begin with. Again, exceptionalism means exclusivity; and exclusivity entails a society committed to educating its citizens in a comprehensive value system, one geared towards a low time preference, or ability to delay instant rewards for greater things in the distant future -- all for the benefit of the common good. The maturity that such a system entails is but another hallmark of a great people, one that both recognizes the importance of thinking beyond immediate appetites and has enough wisdom and discipline to actually execute such a project.\n\nBy stark contrast, any immigration policy that disregards this great tradition and lets in tens of millions of foreigners who don't speak English, who know nothing about America's political culture, and who have no incentive to do so, is one doomed to failure. But more tragically, it does a grave injustice to our forefathers - who did appreciate what was needed to create a society enough to labor relentlessly - shedding much blood along the way, and in many cases making the ultimate sacrifice - so that their progeny might one day enjoy the fruits of their labors. That our modern sensibility is so fleeting and transactional; that politicians struggle so mightily to adopt even the slightest perspective that looks beyond Gross Domestic Product, realizing what so many regular Americans know intuitively, that no amount of money is worth debilitating those sacred bonds that hold a nation together. And which indirectly helps boost that prolific economic engine whose benefits are so readily exploited by those who should know better is a travesty. In sum, they are the suicidal recipes that have brought America to the brink of economic and cultural collapse, and for doing so, have compelled eighty million Americans to deliver President Trump the most consequential electoral victory seen in generations just over a month ago.\n\nThe stakes are far too high to risk gambling what diminishing reserves of America's political culture remains. It is for this reason that the Fourteenth Amendment must be corrected, reinterpreted in its proper, original, and more conservative framing whereby birthright citizenship comes to a categorical end. This would bring the United States in line with every other nation in the world. At the same time it would aptly relegate a policy that has been squandering our cultural inheritance - and doing unspeakable indignities to our ancestors - hopefully now forever to that dustbin of history's failed experiments.\n\nPaul Ingrassia is a Constitutional Scholar; Communications Director of the NCLU; a two-time Claremont Fellow, and is on the Board of Advisors of the New York Young Republican Club and the Italian American Civil Rights League.

        "content": "In a rare and inspiring gathering, scholars and religious leaders representing six different faiths convened at an international seminar to discuss the transformative role of religion in fostering peace, harmony, and justice.\n\nThe seminar, titled \"The Role of Religions in Fostering Peace, Harmony, and Justice\" and organised by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), Islamabad, brought together voices from Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, and Judaism to explore how shared ethical values and consciously practised faith can bridge divides, counter misconceptions, and create a foundation for global unity. This unique event highlighted the potential of dialogue among followers of different faiths to address contemporary challenges and promote inclusive narratives rooted in mutual respect and understanding.\n\nThe session, chaired by Justice Dr Qibla Ayaz, member, Shariat Appellate Bench, Supreme Court of Pakistan (SCP) was addressed by Rev Fr Prof Sarfraz Simon, diocesan director of Catholic Church, Dr Neelima Shukla-Bhatt of Wellesley College, USA, Dr Kalyan Singh Kalyan of GC University, Lahore, Dr Samantha Ilangakoon of University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka, Dr Ophira Gamliel of University of Glasgow, and Dr Hafiz Waqas Khan of Riphah International University, Islamabad.\n\nThe speakers observed that the adaptability of religious teachings in diverse contexts demonstrates their potential to bridge gaps, transforming dialogue into tangible change and offering hope for a future rooted in shared ethical values.\n\nInclusiveness is inherent in all religions, said Dr Qibla Ayaz. However, the media's attention to adverse incidents while overlooking positive contributions fuels religious nationalism. He suggested that religious advocates, policy influencers, and followers of religion must take collective responsibility to bridge gaps, promote unity, and use social media to amplify messages of inclusivity.\n\nHighlighting Islam's message of peace, justice, forgiveness, and respect for diversity, Dr Hafiz Waqas noted that the term \"Islam\" itself signifies peace. He emphasized Islam's commitment to equality and the message of reconciliation and moral leadership in fostering harmony and justice, as outlined in the Holy Quran and Sunnah.\n\nKhalid Rahman, chairman, Institute of Policy Studies, Islamabad, accentuated the decisive role of human behaviour in shaping religion's influence, emphasising that \"religions are not inherently divisive; their impact depends on how they are practised and interpreted.\" He highlighted how religion is often misused to incite violence and exclusion, overshadowing its core values of compassion and justice."

        "content": "New Delhi: India is home to many forts and royalties. Royalty is not limited to culture, customs, and traditions; it also defines a country's heritage. At one point, we were all fascinated by past and present royals.\n\nPalaces are majestic buildings that once housed many royal families and still house some of them. Some have been turned into luxurious hotels. In this article, we will explore five palaces that are still regarded as symbols of grandeur and royal heritage.\n\nPalaces that are regarded as symbols of grandeur and royal heritage\n\nMysore Palace: A Jewel of Indo-Saracenic Architecture\n\nThe Palace of Mysore, also called the Amba Vilas Palace, is a historic building in Mysore, Karnataka. It is a prominent feature of the city's skyline, designed by English architect Henry Irwin. The palace, which has three stories and was built in the Indo-Saracenic style between 1897 and 1912, features square towers topped with domes at each corner.\n\nInside, the Durbar Hall has a beautifully decorated ceiling and carved pillars. The Kalyanamantapa, or marriage pavilion, has glazed tile flooring and a stained glass domed ceiling. Other treasures in the palace include intricately carved doors, a golden howdah (elephant seat), paintings, and a stunning jewel-encrusted golden throne, which is displayed during the Dasara festival.\n\nThe palace complex is walled and contains a Residential Museum, which showcases some of the palace's living quarters and temples, including the Shwetha Varahaswamy temple.\n\nUdaipur's City Palace: A Mewar Dynasty Masterpiece\n\nCity Palace (Raj Mahal) in Udaipur is a large palace complex in Udaipur, Rajasthan, India. It took nearly 400 years to build, with different rulers from the Mewar dynasty contributing to its construction. Maharana Udai Singh II started the palace in 1553 when he moved his capital from Chittor to Udaipur. The palace sits on the east bank of Lake Pichola and includes several buildings within its complex.\n\nThe City Palace is known for its impressive architectural style and is the largest palace in Rajasthan. It is built on a hill, combining Rajasthani Rajput architecture, which offers stunning views of the city and nearby areas. The palace overlooks Lake Pichola and is close to several historic sites, including the Lake Palace, Jag Mandir, Jagdish Temple, Monsoon Palace, and Neemach Mata Temple. These landmarks are nestled within the Aravali mountain range and are linked to popular culture.\n\nExploring the Grandeur of Umaid Bhawan, Falaknuma & Lakshmi Vilas Palaces\n\nUmaid Bhawan\n\nUmaid Bhawan Palace is a beautiful heritage building in Jodhpur, known as the Blue City in Rajasthan. This palace shows the grandeur of the Rajput era and reflects the lifestyle of the former royal family.\n\nThe palace has 347 rooms, a museum, and a collection of vintage cars. It was built between 1929 and 1943 under Maharaja Umaid Singh and designed by architect Henry Lanchester. Today, Taj Hotels manages the palace and is also the home of the former royal family of Jodhpur.\n\nMaharaja Gaj Singh II and his family live in part of the palace, while the rest is open to visitors. Umaid Bhawan Palace is one of the largest living palaces in the world.\n\nFalaknuma Palace\n\nFalaknuma is a palace located in Hyderabad, Telangana. It was originally owned by the Paigah family and later became the property of the Nizam of Hyderabad.\n\nNawab Sir Viqar-ul-Umra, the Prime Minister of Hyderabad state and the uncle and brother-in-law of the sixth Nizam, built the palace. \"Falak-numa\" means \"Like the Sky\" or \"Mirror of Sky\" in Urdu.\n\nAfter visiting Europe, Sir Viqar-ul-Umra decided to construct a European-style residence. He laid the foundation stone on March 3, 1884. It took nine years to finish the construction and decorate the palace. Sir Vicar moved into the Gol Bangla and Zanana Mahel sections of the palace in December 1890 while overseeing the final touches in the Mardana part.\n\nHe used the palace as his private home until around 1897-1898 when he handed it over to the sixth Nizam of Hyderabad.\n\nLakshmi Vilas Palace\n\nLakshmi Vilas Palace, located in the centre of Vadodara, Gujarat, is a stunning palace and the home of the former Gaekwads. The palace showcases a beautiful mix of Indo-Saracenic, Hindu, and Gothic architectural styles.\n\nMaharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III commissioned the palace in 1890, and construction finished in 1896. British architect Charles Mant designed this gem, blending Western and Indian styles.\n\nThe palace has an impressive facade with a central dome over 160 feet high.\n\nThe Durbar Hall is another highlight of the palace. It features a beautiful Venetian mosaic floor, stained glass windows from Belgium, and a stunning ceiling with a mosaic of various forms of the Sun God. The craftsmanship here is exceptional."

        "content": "The Karnataka Cabinet has decided to invite private players for the repair, restoration and management of Lalitha Mahal Palace Hotel. A long-awaited decision, it raises hopes that this grand heritage structure may finally receive the care it deserves.\n\nMany Mysureans feared that by the time our Government finally decides to completely lease or restore Lalitha Mahal Palace, it will no longer be worthy of restoration and instead may need reconstruction.\n\nThis fear is not unfounded, considering what has happened to a couple of heritage structures in Mysuru after the Government waited too long -- they collapsed.\n\nIn 2012, the 130-year-old Lansdowne Building collapsed. In 2016, a part of the 136-year-old Devaraja Market collapsed. In 2022, a portion of the 95-year-old Vani Vilas Market and a part of the 106-year-old Maharani's College collapsed. We feared Lalitha Mahal Palace was next.\n\nBut will this new hope of restoration truly come to fruition? The wait has been on since 2000 when late Union Minister Arun Jaitley, then the Disinvestment Minister, wanted to give up Lalitha Mahal Palace, which came under ITDC (India Tourism Development Corporation). It didn't happen.\n\nFifteen years later, in 2015, the then Union Tourism Minister Mahesh Sharma said, \"We believe it makes little sense to let these hotels run in perpetual losses.\" Still, ITDC didn't give it up.\n\nTwo years later, in 2017, the then State Tourism Minister R.V. Deshpande told the Karnataka Legislative Assembly that his Ministry would take back Lalitha Mahal Palace Hotel.\n\nThen the State did get back Lalitha Mahal Palace and Mysureans thought we'd finally have an iconic five-star hotel worthy of a royal heritage city like ours.\n\nBut alas, it went to Jungle Lodges and Resorts, a State Government body that manages lodges in the jungles, as its name suggests. It had no experience running a luxury hotel or maintaining a heritage structure.\n\nThe Government assured us that it was a temporary arrangement and that a more experienced private hotel company would run it soon after the global tender was floated. It didn't happen.\n\nNow this Government has finally decided to act but the Government must choose wisely because Lalitha Mahal is no ordinary structure; it could change the fate of our city's tourism potential.\n\nLalitha Mahal is not just a building; it's an irreplaceable part of Mysuru's identity. As the city's second-largest royal palace, its revival holds immense potential for tourism and urban branding.\n\nFor tourists, staying in a heritage hotel transforms a trip into a journey through time, allowing them to savour the elegance of a bygone era, it's an 'immersive' experience.\n\nThis unique blend of history and hospitality elevates a destination's allure, attracting high-net-worth visitors and cultural enthusiasts.\n\nFrom Jaipur's Rambagh Palace Hotel to Hyderabad's Falaknuma Palace Hotel, cities with well-maintained heritage hotels often enjoy enhanced global visibility.\n\nA fully restored Lalitha Mahal Palace could do the same for Mysuru.\n\nWhen the Taj Group took over Falaknuma Palace, they spent crores on restoration, transforming it from a crumbling structure into a glittering jewel of Indian heritage. It now serves as both a premier hotel and a symbol of Hyderabad's rich history. Mysuru deserves no less for Lalitha Mahal Palace.\n\nThat is why the Government while calling for a global tender to lease Lalitha Mahal Palace, must strongly consider the company's history and expertise in restoring heritage properties.\n\nThe Government must also pay attention to the company's financial prowess because it costs a lot of money to restore and renovate a Palace. Just consideration of the financial returns to the Government would be myopic.\n\nWhen a financially and professionally strong hotel group takes it over, such as Taj, Oberoi or ITC, they will create not only our city's first proper five-star hotel but also sell our city to high-net-worth tourists. This, while making the hotel itself a tourist attraction.\n\nFor nearly 50 years, Lalitha Mahal Palace has been waiting for its renaissance and if anyone can break the cycle of inaction in restoring Lalitha Mahal Palace, it has to be Chief Minister Siddaramaiah.\n\nKnown for driving projects to completion -- be it Mysuru's concrete roads, new Government Colleges, or a modern District Hospital -- he has a track record of taking initiatives to their logical end.\n\nLet's hope Siddaramaiah and his Government will succeed where others have failed.\n\nRestoring Lalitha Mahal Palace would not only cement his legacy but also revitalise Mysuru's claim as a royal heritage city."

        "content": "Udaipur saw significant tension today following the coronation of Vishvaraj Singh Mewar as the 77th Maharana of Mewar. The conflict arose at the city palace gates when his cousin, Dr. Lakshay Raj Singh Mewar, was denied entry. The palace is managed by a trust overseen by Dr. Lakshay and their uncle, Shreeji Arvind Singh Mewar.\n\nThe incident escalated as supporters of Vishvaraj Singh clashed with those inside the palace after he was blocked from entering. Police intervened, attempting to control the situation as stones were thrown by both sides, resulting in three injuries.\n\nVishvaraj Singh, who recently became the heir to the Mewar dynasty, was crowned in a ceremony at Chittorgarh fort just days after his father's death. During this event, he participated in a traditional ritual signifying his new title, a custom dating back centuries within the Mewar lineage.\n\nAfter his coronation, he aimed to visit family deities at two temples but was refused access to the palace where these are located. The local administration had hoped to permit a few nobles to accompany him for blessings but faced resistance from the trust.\n\nInterview with Royal Heritage Specialist: Tensions in Udaipur Following the Coronation of Vishvaraj Singh Mewar\n\nIn light of⁣ today's unrest in Udaipur⁣ following the coronation of Vishvaraj⁤ Singh Mewar as the 77th Maharana of Mewar, we spoke with Dr. Anika Yadav, ⁣a specialist in ⁣royal heritage and family dynamics. Dr. Yadav ⁢has extensively studied the historical and cultural implications of royal titles and trusts within Indian princely states. Here's her insight into⁢ the current situation:\n\nQ:⁤ Dr. Yadav, can⁤ you explain the ⁣significance of Vishvaraj Singh's coronation in ⁢the⁢ context of Mewar's history?\n\nDr. Anika Yadav: The coronation of Vishvaraj Singh Mewar holds immense importance, particularly as it follows the death of his ⁣father. The ritualistic aspects of the coronation at Chittorgarh⁤ Fort not only symbolize the continuation⁤ of the Mewar lineage but also reaffirm the cultural heritage of the region. It's a profound link to centuries of tradition that underscores the ⁤role of the Maharana as both a political and⁣ spiritual leader.\n\nQ: What do you make of ⁢the tensions that ⁣erupted at the city⁢ palace gates?\n\nDr. Yadav: ⁣The tensions reflect a deeper struggle within the family regarding⁢ the management of royal properties and trusts. The denial of entry to ⁢Dr.⁢ Lakshay Raj Singh Mewar highlights ongoing ⁢disputes that date back to significant changes made in 1984 by the former Maharana ⁢concerning the management of royal assets. This has created a rift not just⁢ in family relations but also in perceptions of authority and legacy among different ⁢family branches.\n\nQ: How do you interpret Vishvaraj Singh's disappointment regarding the denied access to the family deities?\n\nDr. Yadav:  His disappointment is rooted in both personal and traditional significance. For a newly crowned ⁢Maharana, receiving blessings⁣ from family deities is an essential rite that connects him to his ancestral roots. The fact that the⁢ trust's management blocked this access not ⁢only undermines his⁣ authority but also disrupts a vital cultural practice that ⁢has been ⁣observed for generations.\n\nQ: Given the history, how⁤ do you see⁣ this conflict ⁤evolving?\n\nDr. Yadav: I believe this conflict⁢ will continue to be a focal point in Udaipur and beyond. The dynamics of royal families are often complex and intertwined with historical decisions that impact contemporary governance and relationships.⁣ As long as there are unresolved familial disputes over trust management and property rights, tensions are likely to remain high, and this could affect public sentiment towards the royal family.\n\nQ: What do these events mean for the future of the Mewar dynasty?\n\nDr. Yadav: The future will depend greatly on how these conflicts are addressed. If Vishvaraj Singh can navigate these challenges and unite the family under a⁣ common purpose, he ⁤could strengthen ⁣the dynasty's relevance in today's society. However, if divisions persist, the historical ⁢significance of the⁢ Mewar dynasty may⁣ face scrutiny, as public perception often hinges on unity and⁢ stability within royal lineages.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, the historical and cultural ramifications of these events will be closely observed. The royal dispute⁤ in Udaipur not only signifies internal family tensions but serves as a reminder of the complexities surrounding traditional governance⁣ in modern times.\n\nIn an effort to maintain order, police established barricades around the palace. Despite these precautions, tension rose when supporters tried to breach the gates in anger over the entry denial.\n\nVishvaraj Singh expressed disappointment over the situation, highlighting the importance of traditions and blessings in his dialogue with the media. He noted that the current conflict revolves around royal properties and the management of trusts, which are contested by various family members.\n\nThe disagreement traces back to 1984, when the former Maharana made significant changes regarding the management of royal assets, impacting family dynamics. As the conflict continues in Udaipur, this royal dispute is likely to remain a focal point in local discussions."

        "content": "In the heart of Karnataka, the city of Mysore stands as a timeless testament to India's regal past. Often referred to as the \"City of Palaces,\" Mysore is rich in history and culture, offering an immersive experience for those keen on exploring its architectural splendor. Visitors who venture into the city often find themselves surrounded by grand mansions, palatial buildings, and heritage sites that speak of a bygone era. With its regal structures, ornate archways, intricate balustrades, and expansive terraces, Mysore evokes a sense of nostalgia, making it a captivating destination for travelers seeking to step back in time. But how will this regal city, with its enduring allure, continue to influence the global travel industry?\n\nThe Iconic Amba Vilas Palace: A Monument to India's Royalty\n\nAmong the many architectural gems in Mysore, the Amba Vilas Palace -- more commonly known as the Mysore Palace -- remains the city's crowning glory. This grand structure, built nearly a century ago, dominates the landscape and serves as the focal point for visitors. Originally designed by British architect Henry Irwin, the palace was constructed on the grounds of an older wooden structure that was destroyed by fire. This three-story building, made from fine gray granite, rises dramatically in the city center, drawing both domestic and international travelers who come to admire its breathtaking design.\n\nThe palace is an exquisite example of the Indo-Saracenic style, featuring onion domes, minarets, turrets, intricate balconies, and decorative arches. One of its most striking features is the towering 145-foot high structure crowned with a gilded dome and a single golden flag. This monumental edifice is not just an architectural marvel but also a symbol of Mysore's royal heritage. The presence of the palace has become synonymous with the city itself, serving as a powerful draw for tourists. Its overwhelming beauty, particularly when lit up during public holidays, creates an ethereal spectacle that continues to capture the imaginations of visitors from across the world. How might the global fascination with such royal heritage influence the rise of cultural tourism, especially in India's historically rich cities?\n\nThe Golden Throne and Durbar Hall: A Glimpse into Royal Ceremonies\n\nInside the Mysore Palace, the Golden Throne (Ratna Simhasana) and the Durbar Hall leave an indelible impression on visitors. The throne, a magnificent piece of art, is only displayed during special occasions such as the Dussehra festival, further adding to its allure. Made of fig wood, covered in gold, and encrusted with precious jewels, this throne is a masterpiece of craftsmanship. It symbolizes not just royal opulence but also the rich cultural and religious traditions of the Wadiyar dynasty.\n\nThe Durbar Hall, with its vivid ceiling and intricately painted colonnades, is another highlight of the palace. Its ornate décor and the sweeping view of the Chamundi Hills from the balcony are nothing short of spectacular. Visitors are often left in awe of the grandiosity and magnificence of the rooms, which stand as a testament to the royal past. For global travelers, the palace's extravagant details exemplify the rich cultural heritage of India, making it a key destination for those seeking a glimpse into India's royal history.\n\nThe Dolls' Pavilion: A Delight for the Curious Traveler\n\nUpon entering the Mysore Palace, visitors are greeted by the Gombe Thotti, or Dolls' Pavilion, which showcases an eclectic mix of European and Indian sculptures. This gallery, originally a display of the ceremonial objects used during the Dussehra celebrations, now features a wide range of artifacts, including palanquins and a clockwork procession of dolls. These exhibits provide not only a cultural insight into the royal traditions but also serve as a reminder of how Mysore has historically blended Indian and European influences.\n\nFor families, the Dolls' Pavilion is a particularly appealing spot, with its interactive displays and the enchanting mechanical dolls that captivate children and adults alike. As the demand for cultural and immersive experiences increases globally, it is likely that the display of such unique artifacts will continue to draw tourists looking to deepen their understanding of India's diverse cultural heritage.\n\nThe Mysore Fort: A Historical Walk through Time\n\nWhile the grandeur of the Mysore Palace often overshadows it, the Mysore Fort is equally rich in history. Initially built in 1524 by the Wadiyars, the fort's walls have withstood centuries of history, including destruction and reconstruction. The fort was later expanded by Tipu Sultan and subsequently altered by the British in 1799. Today, it offers a unique walking experience, with visitors able to stroll around the preserved walls and explore the many temples and landmarks within the fort's confines.\n\nThe fort's historic significance and the scenic walk around its walls offer a fascinating juxtaposition to the more flamboyant palace. As travelers increasingly seek destinations that offer both natural beauty and historical significance, the fort's preservation highlights how blending history with modern infrastructure can create a destination that appeals to both heritage tourists and history buffs alike.\n\nThe Temples of Mysore: Sacred Spaces within the Royal Grounds\n\nMysore is home to a number of temples that hold immense religious and historical importance. The Sri Lakshmi Ramana Swamy Temple, located within the palace grounds, is one of the oldest in the region and remains a central site for royal ceremonies. Other temples, such as the Shweta Varahaswamy Temple and the Sri Prasanna Krishnaswami Temple, are also scattered throughout the city, each with its own unique artistic and cultural value.\n\nFor visitors interested in the spiritual and religious aspects of India's heritage, these temples provide a deeper connection to Mysore's royal legacy. Their continued significance in the daily lives of the city's residents only adds to the depth of the cultural experience available to travelers.\n\nSound and Light Show: A Dramatic Retelling of Mysore's Royal History\n\nFor those wishing to immerse themselves further in the history of the palace and its rulers, the sound and light show held in the evenings offers a dramatic retelling of Mysore's royal past. Set against the backdrop of the illuminated palace, the show -- though currently narrated in Kannada -- offers a captivating visual experience that conveys the grandeur of Mysore's history through song, music, and narration. This spectacle, followed by the palace's illumination with nearly 100,000 bulbs, creates a mesmerizing finale to the evening, leaving visitors spellbound.\n\nImpact on Global Tourism\n\nAs tourism trends shift towards more culturally immersive and historically rich experiences, the city of Mysore, with its wealth of royal heritage, is well-positioned to become an increasingly important destination for global travelers. The palace, temples, and historic fort collectively offer a multifaceted experience, drawing those interested in India's regal past, architectural grandeur, and cultural traditions.\n\nMysore's role in global tourism is expected to expand as travelers seek out destinations that offer not just scenic beauty but a deeper connection to history and culture. The city's ability to blend heritage with modernity presents an attractive model for other historical destinations around the world, shaping the future of cultural tourism.\n\nMysore's Growing Appeal\n\nAs the world continues to embrace more culturally enriching travel experiences, cities like Mysore, with its opulent palaces, historic forts, and sacred temples, will continue to rise in prominence on the global tourism map. The city's royal heritage, combined with its modern infrastructure, offers a unique blend of old-world charm and contemporary appeal that will undoubtedly shape future travel trends."

From intricate embroidery patterns to grand architectural motifs, these elements of Indian heritage have begun to redefine modern interior design.\n\nCollections that honour India's rich art and tradition are quietly making their way into contemporary homes, creating interiors that feel timeless yet refreshing. By rightly blending the old with the new, these heritage-inspired designs are proving that tradition and innovation can coexist beautifully.\n\nMaharaja palaces-inspired interiors\n\nIndian history is packed with stories of opulence and grandeur, featuring palaces that are exquisite examples of craftsmanship and fine detail. Inspired by the architectural designs of these magnificent spaces, certain contemporary collections offer design elements that bring this feeling of royalty into modern homes.\n\nThese regal-inspired designs reflect the arches, motifs, and luxurious ornamentation of grand Maharaja Palaces but with a refined, minimalist twist suited for today's aesthetic.\n\nExplaining further, interior expert and director at Merino Industries Ltd., Manoj Lohia, stated, \"The Regal range features designs like Gajamudra, Vasantha, and Sanskriti, each capturing a distinct element of royal grandeur. Gajamudra evokes the grace and majesty of the royal elephant, with its extreme matte finish lending an understated elegance to interiors. Vasantha celebrates the lush opulence of palace gardens, bringing the beauty of nature indoors with a refined matte texture. Meanwhile, Sanskriti pays homage to the cultural motifs unique to India's historic palaces, available in multiple colour variations, all presented in an exquisite, extreme matte finish. Together, these designs bring a touch of royalty and sophistication into modern spaces.\"\n\nWhen incorporated thoughtfully, they bring a touch of India's royal heritage while fitting beautifully into modern spaces.\n\nChikan Kari trend\n\nAmong India's diverse art forms, Chikan Kari embroidery holds a special place for its sheer delicacy and understated beauty. These designs often feature soft, linen-like textures that add depth and dimension to walls or cabinets, exuding the finesse of hand-embroidered fabric in a way that feels elegant and approachable.\n\nThe industry expert discussed that the Chikan Kari-inspired collection brings forth designs like Alankrit, Karnika, and Jharokha, each encapsulating the intricate elegance of traditional Indian craftsmanship.\n\n\"Alankrit resembles an ornamental jewel that adorns fabrics, presented in a linen finish that adds subtle texture to any space. Karnika draws inspiration from traditional Indian earrings, infusing interiors with a sense of beauty and sophistication, also in a refined linen finish. Meanwhile, Jharokha captures the essence of the grand arches found in traditional havelis, lending a touch of architectural grace with its linen finish. Together, these designs bring calm elegance and rich heritage into modern settings,\" he explained.\n\nThe Chikan Kari range is ideal for those who enjoy subtlety in their decor. The patterns are neither loud nor overwhelming, instead offering a quiet vibe that enhances a room's ambience.\n\nIkat Weaving designs\n\nIkat is a bold and vibrant art form known for its striking patterns and lively colours. Through reimagining these patterns in new materials, modern design collections let homeowners infuse their spaces with the same energy and dynamism that Ikat is renowned for.\n\nMr. Manoj added, \"The Ikat-inspired collection brings a captivating blend of tradition and elegance through designs like Jhoomar, Sutra, Taranga, and Tarang Pushp. Jhoomar radiates the charm and sophistication of the Ikat pattern with a linen finish that adds depth and texture to interiors.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Sutra celebrates the meticulous threadwork central to Ikat craftsmanship, also offered in a soft linen finish. Taranga captures the fluidity and grace of ocean waves with undulating patterns that evoke a sense of movement and calm. Tarang Pushp combines the delicate beauty of blooming flowers with the flowing elegance of ocean waves, creating a harmonious and balanced design in a linen finish.\"\n\nThe boldness of Ikat-inspired laminates has the ability to add movement to a static space. These designs bring artisanal warmth to a room, bridging the gap between cultural heritage and modern aesthetics."

        "content": "A group led by Charlie Wood from the University of Portsmouth is developing a framework in collaboration with several heritage organisations and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) to enable city-wide efforts to revolutionise heritage preservation and communication.\n\nThe city of Portsmouth is well known for its world-leading heritage sites, including Portsmouth Historic Dockyard, home of King Henry VIII's flagship vessel The Mary Rose, and Lord Nelson's HMS Victory, still a commissioned vessel and the flagship of the Royal Navy under the stewardship of the National Museum of the Royal Navy.\n\nThe application of X-rays to investigate artefacts isn't new, it's formed part of rigorous analyses of heritage collections for some time; however, the shared vision to work together to tell a rich, multi-layered story of Portsmouth, through the combined collections and through the application of advanced microscopy, is indeed something new.\n\nCharlie, an X-ray scientist, said: \"Using advanced science for heritage is vital in helping preserve it for future generations. The most important aspect remains the heritage story, nothing will surpass that, but what we're looking to do is support this by using advanced microscopy to add a deeper perspective to the role the materials played, and continue to play, in the heritage story, including their degradation and conservation strategies.\"\n\nX-ray imaging technology allows delicate and unique artefacts to be digitally copied in 3D, providing a way to preserve artefacts within collections under threat of decay, and a way for them to be displayed to the public without concern of damage being caused to the originals.\n\nHe added: \"This 3D digital preservation through X-ray is mostly non-destructive, which is a huge advantage for the heritage sector, and the reason it has been employed previously, as it provides incredibly detailed analysis of artefacts, though care must still be taken to avoid damage when high-energy X-rays and prolonged exposures are used.\"\n\nThe very first iron-hulled warship, HMS Warrior\n\nThis initiative brings together the unique expertise of professionals from the Mary Rose Museum, the National Museum of the Royal Navy, Historic England, English Heritage, and the University of Portsmouth's Heritage Hub. By working collectively, the team will advance heritage science in Portsmouth, drawing on their combined strengths to uncover new insights into conservation and heritage storytelling. This collaborative approach aims to provide a richer, multi-layered perspective on the city's history, supported by cutting-edge scientific methods.\n\nCharlie added: \"Our vision is to create a model where each city or region in the UK can develop its own unique approach to heritage science, leveraging local strengths and expertise.\"\n\nGill Campbell said: \"Historic England are delighted to be part of this initiative. Together we can transform heritage science practice across Portsmouth and beyond.\"\n\nWith this heritage framework being piloted in the city of Portsmouth, the aim is to share this nationally and inspire other cities and regions to form similar initiatives, each with its own distinctive focus. This aligns with AHRC's new Research Infrastructure for Conservation and Heritage Science (RICHeS) from AHRC, supporting heritage science by enabling interdisciplinary research and fostering a diverse and innovative approach to heritage preservation and communication across the UK.\n\nYou might also like... /Public Release.
